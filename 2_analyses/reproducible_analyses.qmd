# Analyses in the Introduction section

## Frequency of data sharing in video studies

* The following __search query__ was applied in [Web of Science](https://www.webofscience.com) on September 6 2023: `("video study" OR "video data") AND (classroom OR teach*)` in "Topic" (Searches title, abstract, author keywords, and Keywords Plus).
* We have further narrowed the __publication years__ to 2000 - 2023, as digital archiving infrastructures were increasingly established from 2000 onwards.
  
::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
## This resulted in 285 documents.

:::

  
* __Inclusion criteria__ for subsequent screening of the results
  - The document describes an empirical study
  - The study uses video data to investigate an educational topic
  - The document describes primary research (does not reuse video data)
* __Exclusion criteria__
  - The document is a methods paper
  - The study reuses video data

Strategy of synthesis:

* Duplicates of research projects (several publications from one video data set) will be synthesized to one case. Within the case we will investigate each document.

We then coded: 

* Whether authors made a statement about the accessibility of the data
* Whether the openness include public access, restricted access, no access, access upon request
* Whether the authors use established infrastructure (repositories or research data centers)
* Whether the journal mandates authors to make a statement about the accessibility of the data
