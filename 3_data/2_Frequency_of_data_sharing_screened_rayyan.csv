Using Actor-Network Theory, we identified the key entities (social and material) that constitute the teaching practices. While the entities were fairly similar in the cases, the resulting relationships between them, while appearing distinctive, differed. Insights into how teaching practices unfold can offer valuable knowledge when evaluating existing programs and designing new programs in higher education.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jürgen""=>""Included"", ""Juergen""=>""Included""} | USER-NOTES: {""Jürgen""=>[""these are notes""]}",10.1016/j.ijer.2021.101919     EA JAN 2022,NETWORKS,,

Their experiences with exams were observed through pretend play and recorded in field diaries, audio, and video. Data were analyzed using Thematic Analysis and discussed according to the PERMA-V model, a theoretical framework from positive psychology.        Results: Several objects and equipment that seem to affect the wellbeing of children during exams were identified. Four playful interventions were proposed as supportive care initiatives: use of technology to allow immersive experiences in learning about treatment and medical condition; design for personalization; gamifying experiences to allow positive reinforcement; and design for focus redirection.        Conclusions: Guidelines for playful interventions to foster the subjective wellbeing of hospitalized children during image and laboratory exams were proposed. The PERMA-V model provided a solid base for the analysis of the interventions, which will be implemented and tested in future studies in clinical settings.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jürgen""=>""Excluded"", ""Juergen""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not educational context",10.1016/j.ejon.2022.102094     EA JAN 2022,VIRTUAL-REALITY;NEGATIVE AFFECT;CHILDREN;FEASIBILITY;PARENTS,,

While using these two settings as examples, we have structured our reflections around themes pertinent to video research in general, namely, research methods, data management, and research ethics. SUL and MathTrack share an understanding of mathematics learning as social multimodal practice, and provide possibilities for zooming into the situational micro interactions that construct collaborative problem-solving learning. Both settings provide rich data for in-depth analyses of peer interactions and learning processes. The settings share special needs for technical support and data management, as well as attention to ethical aspects from the perspective of the participants' security and discretion. SUL data are especially suitable for investigating interactions on a broad scope, addressing how multiple interactional processes intertwine. MathTrack, on the other hand, enables exploration of participants' visual attention in detail and its role in learning.

Both perspectives have sidelined the use of real material objects that are indispensable for scientists to construct arguments about the natural world. To address this gap, this article investigates how material objects are used to coordinate with our speech and actions to shape argumentation in secondary physical science. Drawing on actor-network theory, the article reframes argumentation as a chain of human-material interactions incorporating the role of physical things to construct evidence. Based on a collective case study comprising classroom video data generated from two grade nine science classrooms, the article examines how teachers and students used material objects to engage in argumentation related to qualitative analysis in chemistry and Newton's laws of motions in physics. The analysis reveals two major themes: (a) material inquiry as the framing of questions and statements about the behavior or property of the material world and (b) material transformation as the orchestration of material objects, embodied actions, and words to actively create evidence. This article concludes that both material inquiry and material transformation are essential prerequisites for scientific argumentation to take place, not only in research laboratories, but also in science classrooms. The contribution to the development of a future socio-material theory of scientific argumentation, which takes material agency and multimodal discourse into account, are also discussed.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jürgen""=>""Included"", ""Juergen""=>""Included""}",10.1002/tea.21749     EA JAN 2022,SCHOOL-STUDENTS;DRIVEN INQUIRY;MULTIMODAL REPRESENTATIONS;CONSTRUCT        ARGUMENTS;PEER ARGUMENTATION;SCIENCE;CLASSROOM;EXPLANATION;LITERACY;TEACHERS,,

Recent work has elevated the integral role of emotion in sparking and sustaining such disciplinary practices, deepening the field's understanding of what is entailed in ""doing"" science. Yet even as we gain this richer understanding of practice, less attention has been given to the places where practice emerges. These places play a critical role in the co-emergence of emotion and practice, and while separate strands of research have elevated emotion and practice or, alternately, place and practice, rarely has their dynamic relationship been considered together. In this article, I explore this interplay of emotion, place, and practice emergent in children's sampling practices within a multiweek curriculum centered around their schoolyard soil ecosystem. Through a comparative case study analysis of two student pairs using video data, student interviews, and classroom artifacts, my analysis reveals how children's emergent emotion was entangled in their relationships with the schoolyard and life within, shaping not only how they engaged in sampling practices but also what dimensions of the ecological system they attended to. I argue that emotion and place should be central to the design, teaching, and analysis of learning contexts, in turn centering the social and emplaced dimensions of science disciplinary practices for children and scientists alike. Implications for science teaching and learning are discussed, with particular consideration of field-based sciences.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jürgen""=>""Included"", ""Juergen""=>""Included""}",10.1002/sce.21702     EA FEB 2022,FIELD ECOLOGY;SCIENCE-EDUCATION;EXPRESSIONS;KNOWLEDGE;CULTURE;QUALITY;DESIGN;SPACE;WORLD;Only Child;Child;Emotions,,

Video data from structured lesson observations were triangulated with teacher post-lesson interviews and thematically coded. The interviews indicated that all teachers demonstrated a change in mindset and a clear understanding of interactive teaching methods. However, the structured observations revealed that only half of the teachers were using these interactive methods. Teachers also emphasised the value of OER and tablet technologies in improving lesson planning and making classroom learning more authentic. The use of technology, as both a TPD medium and as a classroom tool, showed potential to enhance the quality of TPD and teacher quality.

Three PSTs selected by convenience sampling (22-24 years old), their 60 eighth-grade students (three classes: 38 boys, 22 girls, M-age = 13.3), and a mentoring team (one teacher educator, one university supervisor, and one cooperating teacher) participated in the study. The PSTs participated in a two-stage programme where they learned how to teach volleyball using SE-SGA, and then implemented an SE-SGA unit during their school placement. Using audio/video data from 30 lessons, we examined PSTs' SCK (content development, depth of content knowledge) on a lesson-by-lesson basis. We also assessed the 2v2 game-play performance of PSTs' students across three assessment points. Descriptive statistics were computed for SCK scores and repeated measures analysis of variances were used to analyse variance in game-play variables over time. Results showed improvement in PSTs' SCK and students' game-play. The PSTs showed strong SCK, with index levels above the 3.0 cut point, and progressive use of informing, refining, and applying-game tasks over time. Students improved in most game-play variables (namely 'serve', 'reception', 'setting') and the 'game performance index' over time. Student game-play development seemed to be strongly influenced by an interdependent interaction between PSTs' SCK and additional situated, model-based features of content development (i.e. extensive application of knowledge in competition events, the problem-solving focus of the refining tasks).","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jürgen""=>""Included"", ""Juergen""=>""Included""}",10.1177/1356336X221084516     EA MAR 2022,PERFORMANCE;Physical Education and Training;Sports,,

Eighty-five junior high school mathematics teachers and their students in Shanghai were observed to explore the impact of specific teaching practices on students' interest, self-efficacy, and mathematics achievement scores. The results revealed that social-emotional support and instruction quality were the key dimensions relating to the characteristics and differences of mathematics lessons in Shanghai. While the former had a significantly positive impact on students' general mathematics self-efficacy, the latter had a significantly positive impact on students' mathematics interest.

By employing a sociocultural perspective, we examine formulations inscribed in socio-material artifacts about what students should learn and how they should engage with knowledge. We explore how these formulations are mobilized in instructional work and the implications this activity has for student participation. To address this issue, we analyzed video data of how teachers invoke competence aims from the national curriculum in their instructional work in six classrooms. The analytical procedures were derived from interaction analysis. The analysis focuses on how such formulations explicitly mediate social interaction as it unfolds on a micro level. The findings show that competence aims gain different functions as they are mobilized in classroom practice; in other words, they serve different purposes in teachers' instructional work and anticipate different modes of student participation. In this study, the competence aims were (a) invoked as a source of authority, (b) translated into instructions, and (c) mobilized to obtain social order in the classroom. More rarely, the competence aims were used in meta-level discussions, where they functioned to reach agreements on how to pursue work toward joint goals. We discuss the implications of these ways of invoking competence aims for student participation.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jürgen""=>""Included"", ""Juergen""=>""Included""}",10.1007/s10212-022-00610-3     EA APR 2022,AGENCY;VIDEO;PARTICIPATION;COMMUNITY;SYSTEMS;VOICES;TOOLS;Curriculum,,

As educators seek to increase refugee students' access to powerful mathematics learning, an understanding of how refugee families view and participate in their children's mathematics learning can offer insights for how we might reach the goal of equitable educational access. Purpose/Focus of Study: In the Goc-MAT project, we focused on developing equitable mathematics teaching practices with teachers (K-3) in schools highly populated with refugee children. The research that we present here, drawing on notions of community cultural wealth capital, offers a multifaceted view of how families of young children with refugee status articulated understandings of their roles in children's mathematics learning. Setting: Our fieldwork took place in four different cities highly populated by people with refugee status in Turkey, the country located at the center of the worldwide trend of mass migration. Participants: We examined data from families (N = 54, mainly from Syria) who participated in the family engagement component of the larger project, carried out through multilingual family mathematics workshops. Research Design: We employed qualitative research methods and conducted two-year-long observations and video recordings in the context of multilingual family mathematics workshops. In the workshops, families, teachers, and researchers engaged in patterns and early algebra activities, as well as in family conversations facilitated through open-ended prompts, mathematics picture books, and educational journey maps. Over two years, we collected data comprising recorded dialogues with families, artifacts produced in the workshops, and video data of families' mathematical interactions. Findings: Our analysis yielded two key understandings: (1) Family engagement practices around mathematics set a context to realize the nuanced nature of refugee families' cultural wealth and efforts for their children's education; and (2) refugee families' knowledge of mathematics itself as a discipline and their mathematical capital, which are typically not recognized in school contexts, can serve as resources for mathematics teaching. Conclusions/Recommendations: The findings provide insight for teachers, researchers, and policy makers about how we might engage multilingual children and families with refugee status in powerful ways in mathematics education.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jürgen""=>""Included"", ""Juergen""=>""Included""}",10.1177/01614681221103948,Only Child;Child;Mathematics,,

However, it remains unclear how the affective states vary during collaboration and how they occur with regulation of learning. Appropriate methods are needed to track both group affective states and these interaction processes. Aims The present study identifies different socio-emotional interaction episodes during groups' collaborative learning and examines how group affective states fluctuate with regulation of learning during these episodes. Sample The participants were 54 secondary school students working in groups across four science learning sessions. Methods Multichannel process data (video, electrodermal activity [EDA]) were collected in an authentic classroom. Groups' affective states were measured with emotional valence captured from video data, and activation captured as sympathetic arousal from EDA data. Regulation of learning was observed from the videotaped interactions. Results The study disclosed four clusters of socio-emotional interaction episodes (positive, negative, occasional regulation, frequent regulation), which differed in terms of fluctuation of affective states and activated regulation of learning. These clustered episodes confirm how affective states are constantly reset by socio-emotional interactions and regulation of learning. The results also show that states requiring regulation do not automatically lead to its activation. Conclusions By advancing existing understanding of how group level socio-emotional processes contribute to regulation of learning, the study has implications for educational design and psychological practice.

Three researchers coded more than 6 h of video data showing children's play with digital coding games. Findings include, that the type of game did influence the different ways that children behaved while playing. However, during both games, children had the same amount of inde-pendent play. Children who played more independently during Daisy the Dinosaur learned more coding skills. This may be because these children were focusing more on the game than their peers as we did not find a similar effect for the game Kodable.

Studies that contribute to this growing body of work are often conducted in learning environments that are framed as ""successful."" As a researcher who is concerned with issues of equity and who acknowledges the importance of closely attending to the quality of the mathematical activity in which students are being asked to engage, my stance on ""successful learning environments"" pulls from both Gutierrez's descriptions of what characterizes classrooms as aiming for equity and the emphasis on the importance of conceptually oriented goals for student learning that is outlined in documents like the Standards. Though as a field we are growing in our knowledge of practices that support these successful learning environments, this knowledge has not yet been reflected in many of the observational tools, rubrics, and protocols used to study these environments. In addition, there is a growing need to develop empirically grounded ways of attending to the extent to which the practices that are being outlined in research literature actually contribute to the ""success"" of these learning environments. Purpose:The purpose of this article is to explore one way of meeting this growing need by describing the complex work of developing a set of classroom observation rubrics (the Equity and Access Rubrics for Mathematics Instruction, EAR-MI) designed to support efforts in identifying and observing critical features of classrooms characterized as having potential for ""success."" In developing the rubrics, I took as my starting place findings from an analysis that compared a set of classrooms that were characterized as demonstrating aspects of successful learning environments and a set of classrooms that were not characterized as successful. This paper not only describes the process of developing the rubrics, but also outlines some of the qualitative differences that distinguished more and less effective examples of the practices the rubrics are designed to capture. Research Design:In designing the rubrics, I engaged in multiple cycles of qualitative analyses of video data collected from a large-scale study. Specifically, I iteratively designed, tested, and revised the developing rubrics while consistently collaborating with, consulting with, and receiving feedback from different experts in the field of education. Conclusions:Although I fully acknowledge and recognize that there are several tensions and limitations of this work, I argue that developing rubrics like the EAR-MI is still worthwhile. One reason that I give for continuing these types of efforts is that it contributes to the work of breaking down forms of practice into components and identifying key aspects of specific practices that are critical for supporting student learning in ways that make potentially productive routines of action visible to and learnable by others, which may ultimately contribute to the development of more successful learning environments.        I also argue that rubrics like the EAR-MI have the potential to support researchers in developing stronger evidence of the effectiveness of practices that prior research has identified as critical for marginalized students and in more accurately and concretely identifying and describing learning environments as having potential for ""success.

It has been subject to various impediments and has transformed over time. Besides a decrease in bedside time, there has also been a didactic diversification. In order to use time at the bedside effectively and understand the current design of BST, we here offer an evidence-based insight into how BST is practiced. This may serve as a basis for a refinement of its didactic design. Methods In the current study, we investigate the interrelationships between learning content and the social as well as spatial structures of BST. To this end, we have empirically analysed almost 80 hours of video material from a total of 36 BST sessions with good interrater reliability. Results BST lasted on average 125 min, most of which was spent in plenary and less than a third of the time at the patient's bedside. History taking was primarily practiced at the bedside while case presentations, clinical reasoning and theoretical knowledge were largely taught away from the patient. Clinical examination took place to a similar extent in the patient's room and in the theory room. Conclusions Even though the filmed BSTs are not purely ""bedside"", the teaching format investigated here is a typical example of undergraduate medical education. In order to maximize the teaching time available, a suitable learning space should be provided in addition to the bedside. Moreover, the clinical examination should be revised in its general sequence prior to the BST, and conscious decisions should be made regarding the social structure so as to optimize the potential of small groups and plenary sessions.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jürgen""=>""Included"", ""Juergen""=>""Included""}",10.1186/s12909-022-03855-0,CLINICAL SKILLS;MEDICAL-EDUCATION;ATTENDING ROUNDS;STUDENT;CONSTRUCTION;EXPERIENCES;STRATEGIES;CURRICULUM;TEACHERS;IMPACT,,

Classroom race talk, however, often includes moments of discomfort or confusion as teachers and students navigate new norms for making sense of race and racism. The purpose of this paper is to examine how one white teacher and her multiracial class of fourth-grade students navigated race talk tensions while reading and discussing shared texts. Design/methodology/approachData for this paper were collected as part of a larger, year-long qualitative study on antiracist pedagogy. In this paper, the author analyzes video data of classroom race talk recorded during whole-class and small-group literacy lessons. Using inductive coding and reconstructive critical discourse analysis, the author examines how the teacher and students co-constructed meaning during tense or confusing conversational moments. FindingsThe findings demonstrate that the teacher and students jointly mediated tensions by using the practices of racial literacy, which included learning about the history of racial inequality in the USA, considering racism as structural and systemic rather than individual and asking and answering questions for continued inquiry and critical self-reflection. While previous research studies have characterized race talk tensions as problems or obstacles to student learning, the findings from this study suggest that tensions can be generative to developing and enacting racial literacy. Originality/valueIn the current political climate, alarmist rhetoric issued by conservative politicians and media outlets has discredited race talk as harmful or damaging to children. This study offers a positive reframing of tensions, which may provide teachers encouragement to pursue literacy instruction that equips students with knowledge and skills to better understand and confront racism.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jürgen""=>""Included"", ""Juergen""=>""Included""}",10.1108/ETPC-02-2022-0028     EA DEC 2022,WHITENESS;EDUCATION;JUSTICE;Continental Population Groups,,

With this focus on practices, such as scientific modeling, a powerful tool for sense-making and reasoning, comes a need to observe and understand if and how it is actually occurring, particularly in elementary science learning environments. To address this need, and moving forward an international, collaborative research effort centered around scientific modeling, we undertook a cross-national observational study in which we used an observation protocol to characterize scientific modeling practices in elementary classrooms in both the United States and Germany. Drawing on existing video-based datasets from multiple projects, this study's findings provide empirical evidence for model-based teaching and learning and explore the relative frequencies of relevant modeling subpractices (i.e., construction, use, evaluation, and revision of scientific models) in regular, day-to-day elementary science classrooms. This study also illustrates the differences and similarities between German and American science instruction. In general, students in both countries experience model construction more often than other modeling practices. German teachers more consistently foreground anchoring phenomena and students' questions/preconceptions as part of the modeling process, thus leading to slightly higher overall modeling scores-despite a complete lack of model evaluation and revision in any of the observed German classrooms. Ultimately, however, young learners in both nations seem to experience alarmingly little opportunities to engage in any of the modeling subpractices.

Existing conceptions of CBGD suggest that a gradient towards increased opportunities for students to make elaborative verbal contributions is an important element of such seminars. To verify this assumption, we investigate empirically if clinical teachers progress from more basic, knowledge-oriented questions towards more advanced, elaboration-oriented questions in such seminars. Methods: We videotaped 21 different clinical teachers and 398 medical students in 32 CBGD-seminars on surgery and internal medicine. We coded closed-reproductive and open-elaborative teacher questions as well as reproductive and elaborative student responses to these questions. Inter-rater reliability was satisfactory. To determine trends regarding the teacher questions / student responses, we compared eight time-segments of equal duration per seminar. Results: Overall, clinical teachers asked more closed-reproductive than open-elaborative questions. Students gave more reproductive than elaborative responses. Regarding the frequencies of these forms of teacher questions / student responses, we found no significant differences over time. Conclusions: Clinical teachers did not deliberately modify the types of questions over time to push students towards more elaborative responses. We conclude that the critical question to which degree promising teaching approaches are actually put into clinical teaching practice should be raised more purposefully in medical education research.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jürgen""=>""Included"", ""Juergen""=>""Included""}",10.1186/s12909-022-03944-0,Cesarean Section,,

Like many cultural groups, the Maya of Chiapas are experiencing rapid sociodemographic shifts. Three generations of girls (N = 134) were observed at their looms: in the 1970 subsistence economy; in the transition to a commercial economy in the 1990s; and in 2012, when the commercial economy required formal education. Multilevel models showed that intergenerational sociodemographic change - increased time in school, greater involvement in the money economy, and decreased family size - changed weaving apprenticeship, which, in turn, was related to changes in characteristics of learners. In 2012, weaving learners received more explanations, praise, and body instruction from their teachers. Learners, in turn, asked more questions. However, these changes came at a cost - the gradual loss of weaving as an everyday subsistence practice and art form. Tracing intergenerational change over three generations, this study makes a unique contribution to an understanding of cultural evolution.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jürgen""=>""Included"", ""Juergen""=>""Included""}",10.1080/10888691.2022.2151445     EA DEC 2022,COGNITIVE REPRESENTATION;CHILDRENS QUESTIONS;ARAB COMMUNITIES;SOCIETAL CHANGE;FAMILY;ACQUISITION;CHILDHOOD;MOTHERS;VALUES;URBANIZATION,,

Empirical studies have repeatedly shown that inquiry-related activities should be combined with instruction that explicitly addresses procedural and epistemic knowledge to support students' learning effectively.PurposeThe aim of this study is to explore to what extent explicit instruction on procedural and epistemic knowledge is occurring in inquiry-based biology and chemistry lessons.SampleThe sample analysed in this study consist of 16 inquiry-based biology and chemistry lessons recorded in German classrooms.Design and MethodsThe video recordings of the lessons were analysed in three steps. First, event-based codes were used to identify all phases of a lesson in which students were engaged in an inquiry-related activity (e.g. developing questions, planning investigations). Second, each phase was analysed with respect to features of explicit instruction (e.g. explications of inquiry strategies). Third, event-based codes were used to capture individual features of explicit instruction in a phase.ResultsIn our sample explicit instruction on procedural knowledge occurred rarely and mostly in the form of brief sidenotes rather than as a comprehensive and deliberately planned action. Furthermore, explicit instruction on epistemic knowledge was virtually non-existent. However, we observed that many tasks and questions that are given by the teachers during their lessons have a high potential for making procedural (and epistemic) aspects explicit.ConclusionWhile this explorative study does not allow for causal explanations for the lack of explicit instruction, its findings provide important insights into classroom practice. Implications for teacher education and future research are discussed.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jürgen""=>""Included"", ""Juergen""=>""Included""}",10.1080/02635143.2022.2153245     EA DEC 2022,INQUIRY-BASED INSTRUCTION;OF-VARIABLES STRATEGY;SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY;CHILDRENS ACQUISITION;SCIENCE;VIEWS;TEACHERS;SKILLS,,

Our exploratory qualitative study had as its research question: What can children learn about citizenship when they engage with data science? The case study in this paper illustrated ways that children's learning about citizenship were enriched through an age-appropriate data science investigation. The study analysed classroom video from a Year 4 classroom (aged 9-10) over six lessons that integrated curricula in digital technologies, health, and mathematics. In these lessons, the children generated and analysed non-standard data and debated social, well-being and privacy issues as they considered their activities in cyberspace. The video data were analysed using a framework based on critical citizenship education literature that examined dimensions of power, collective engagement, individual responsibility and action. Three key findings emerged. First, the case study highlighted skills in citizenship education developed through data science, positioning children as agents and advocates. Second, the study showed how a complex data investigation in citizenship education was achievable with primary children through meaningful curriculum integration. This is important given that problems that citizens address are typically interdisciplinary. Finally, the findings revealed a gap between data science skills and those developed in the mathematics curriculum, and recommend ways that the maths curriculum could be updated.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jürgen""=>""Included"", ""Juergen""=>""Included""}",10.1007/s11858-022-01450-7     EA JAN 2023,FRAMEWORK;Learning,,

In dual language bilingual education (DLBE) preschool programs, teachers utilize translanguaging practices to facilitate communication, scaffold learning, and encourage participation. Using a sustainable translanguaging lens, we explore English- and Spanish-language model teachers' pedagogical choices in Show-and-Tell in support of children's Show-and-Tell purposes and practices. Video data were analyzed for discourse- and content-related codes to examine teachers' discursive and translanguaging choices and presenters' languaging practices during Show-and-Tell. Qualitative analyses revealed that teachers' translanguaging choices vary in response to the language context (i.e. teacher's designated language of instruction and the target language of the Show-and-Tell) and to children's languaging practices (i.e. choice of language, amount of unprompted talk, purpose of presentation, degree of peer involvement). Given the vulnerable status of Spanish as the minoritized language in an English-majority culture, teachers sustained the use and modeling of Spanish in Spanish Show-and-Tell while integrating Spanish as a supportive resource in English Show-and-Tell.

An adapted version of the Early Child-hood Teacher Behaviour Observation (ECTBO) instrument was used to investigate the possible reasons for teachers' current behaviours in Hong Kong visual arts classrooms. In an observation study, a total of 18 classrooms with 76 children in two local kindergartens in Hong Kong were observed during a 30-min visual arts activity. Altogether, 540 min of video data were recorded and analysed using field notes and a time sampling strategy. In addition, 18 class teachers from the observed classrooms were invited to give post-observation interviews, and 810 min of data were recorded. The interview participants supported the importance of non-directive early childhood arts. However, the observation findings revealed that they still relied heavily on directive teaching in implementing early visual arts teaching. Thus, a discrepancy was found between the teachers' subject matter knowledge in visual arts and the integration of their pedagogies in their actual classroom practice. The findings of this study in a local setting have the potential to significantly change the way in which early childhood visual arts teaching is conceptualised and discussed in international contexts.(c) 2023 The Authors.

Our findings show that both top-down and bottom-up approaches to integrating school subjects into a makerspace were effective but underused.

We used an adapted version of the Munich Attention Inventory (Helmke & Renkl, 1992) to assess the behavioral engagement of all learners during the active work phases in one-second intervals by four independent raters. In educational psychology, video studies are often used to describe and analyze classroom processes - although they are considered as being very resource-intensive and costly. Therefore, in order to enable efficient and economical design planning of studies this study investigates up to how many seconds the behavioral engagement of students can be reliably observed. In line with our expectations, the results of the G-Study show that individual learners variance explanation was 18.85% across all work phases. The time in seconds (2.67%) explains only a marginal part of the variance. There remains a large proportion of unexplained residual variance (78.48%). The reliability coefficient with f = .99 is very good due to common standards. The decision study (D-Study) shows that results are reliable even when observing just 30 seconds (f = .87). The results indicate that student-centered video analyses offer a valuable way to capture the behavioral engagement of all students, in that information on all learners is available throughout the entire lesson.

Unfortunately, most of the existing research has highlighted immersive video without accompanying immersive audio. This use of monophonic audio can create a disconnect for viewers as they experience close to real world video with sounds that do not match a real-world environment. The purpose of this study was to respond to this gap in the literature by exploring the use of ambisonic audio and its impact on preservice teacher noticing and variability of viewing focus when watching 360 video. Data were collected from undergraduate teacher education students who participated in a self-paced online activity that included watching 360 videos and responding to a questionnaire. A convergent mixed methods design was employed to compare participants' professional noticing and observed viewing behavior in the context of ambisonic and monophonic audio. Results showed that users in ambisonic audio conditions in 360 video environments were more likely to have higher focus. Moreover, for users who had specific professional knowledge, monophonic audio with immersive video had a negative impact on their variance in focus.

We used a Poisson model and generalized mixed models to analyse these research questions. Most frequently, students made reproduction mistakes. Relatively high rates of rejection and a similar prevalence of low and high levels of elaboration and correction time for students were observed. Reproduction mistakes were associated with the highest level of rejection and the lowest level of elaboration. High levels of elaboration were observed when students were applying skills in new situations. Students were most often allowed time to correct when mistakes in the areas of analysis or application of skills and knowledge had occurred. There is a decrease in the rate of making mistakes for neurology and orthopaedics compared to internal medicine.

However, there is currently no available framework, coding scheme, or method of inquiry to specifically analyze the use of material objects in science meaning-making.PurposeThis paper presents and discusses two analytical frameworks developed to examine teachers' and students' interaction with material objects during classroom discourse.Design and methodsThe first analytical framework was theoretically informed by multimodal interaction analysis (MIA), focusing on humans' situated interaction using embodied and disembodied modes located in the material world. The second framework was informed by social semiotics multimodal analysis (SSMA), focusing on material interaction as a semiotic mode with unique affordances for sign-makers to make meaning alongside other semiotic modes (e.g. speech, gesture).SampleBoth frameworks are used to analyze two vignettes of classroom discourse generated from video data to illustrate their applications, coding procedures, and interpretative potential.ResultsThe MIA-informed framework highlighted the dynamic and reciprocal relations between students' experiences and the transformation of materials, while the SSMA-informed framework highlighted the subtle meanings constructed with the unique affordances of the material mode.ConclusionThe affordances and limitations of the two frameworks are discussed, along with their compatibility and complementary relations. This work contributes to the emerging field of materiality in science education research and provides a foundation for future studies on the analysis of material interaction in science meaning-making.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jürgen""=>""Excluded"", ""Juergen""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: no video data",10.1080/02635143.2023.2232307     EA JUL 2023,MULTIMODAL REPRESENTATIONS;CLASSROOM;DISCOURSE,,

Existing operationalizations of these dimensions have mostly used comprehensive ratings that combine various subdimensions of task quality and interaction quality. The current study disentangles interaction quality in a video data corpus study (of 49 middle school classrooms sharing the same tasks) to identify those quality features that predict students' learning gains in conceptual understanding. The regression analysis reveals that quality features of students' individual engagement do not predict individual student learning, whereas teachers' support of learning content-relevant vocabulary predicts the small groups' learning. For at-risk students, the collective time spent on conceptual practices (i.e. explaining meanings of concepts) on students' learning is significantly predictive. The observation that different operationalizations (for similar aspects of interaction quality) lead to different impacts on the learning gains contributes to ongoing research efforts to refine and increase insight into aspects of interaction quality.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jürgen""=>""Included"", ""Juergen""=>""Included""}",10.1007/s10763-023-10389-4     EA AUG 2023,MATHEMATICAL KNOWLEDGE;CLASSROOM PROCESSES;TEACHERS;CONCEPTUALIZATION;LITERACY;STUDENTS;Cognition,,

However, one of the challenges faced during such observation is the strenuous task of coding large amounts of video data through repeated viewings. In this research, we confirm the possibilities of classifying students' learning behavior using data obtained from multimodal distribution. We employed computer algorithms to classify students' learning behavior in animated programming classrooms and used information from this classification to predict learning outcomes. Specifically, our study indicates the presence of three clusters of students in the domain of ""stay active"", ""stay passive"", and ""to-passive"". We also found a relationship between these profiles and learning outcomes. We discussed our findings in accordance with the engagement and instructional quality models and believed that our statistical approach will support the ongoing refinement of the models in the context of behavioral profiling and classroom interaction. We recommend that further studies should identify different epistemological frames in diverse classroom settings to provide sufficient explanations of students' learning processes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jürgen""=>""Included"", ""Juergen""=>""Excluded""}",10.1007/s10639-023-12079-8     EA AUG 2023,"HIDDEN MARKOV-MODELS;NOTE-TAKING;COGNITIVE ENGAGEMENT;COLLEGE-STUDENTS;LATENT PROFILE;BACK-PAIN;AT-RISK;PERFORMANCE;ATTENTION;COMPREHENSION;Animals;Behavior, Animal;Animal Shells;Learning",,

This article explores how, as an institutional space, the early childhood education and care (ECEC) setting is (re)produced within young children's encounters with others during a transition period. Video-recorded observations of three infant-toddlers' first months of attendance to an ECEC setting were analysed following analytic induction and video interaction analysis. Two examples illustrating object ownership negotiations are discussed. The results show that, in their encounters with others, newcomers actively contributed to (re)producing the ECEC setting by advancing their own understandings of objects and ownership, practicing their own ways of being with objects. Moreover, the results indicate that teachers' contributions strongly influenced the outcomes of the encounters and, consequently, the constitution of shared understandings of objects and object ownership within the ECEC setting.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Jürgen""=>""Included"", ""Juergen""=>""Included""}",10.1080/1350293X.2023.2250588,TODDLERS;CHILDREN;SPACE;Finland;Home Care Services,,
