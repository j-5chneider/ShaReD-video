J;"Hiebert, J; Stigler, JW";;;;"Hiebert, J; Stigler, JW";;;A proposal for improving classroom teaching: Lessons from the TIMSS Video Study;ELEMENTARY SCHOOL JOURNAL;;;;;;;;;;;;Results from the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) Video Study of Teaching show that many teachers in the United States believe they are changing the way they teach while they retain the core of traditional practice. Results from the video study, which also included teachers from Germany and Japan, along with comparisons of teacher development systems, help to explain the persistence of traditional teaching methods and point to a new model for improving teaching. After presenting results from the video study regarding teachers' perceptions of the effects of recent reforms on their practice, we propose a research and development system for improving teaching that builds on the Japanese process of lesson study. We describe the process as it works in Japan and outline the conditions that would enable such a process to function effectively in the United States.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0013-5984;;;;;SEP;2000;101;1;;;;;3;20;;10.1086/499656;http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/499656;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000089061000002;View Full Record in Web of Science
J;"Franks, A; Jewitt, C";;;;"Franks, A; Jewitt, C";;;The meaning of action in learning and teaching;BRITISH EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH JOURNAL;;;;;;;;;;;;Action is a highly theorised aspect of social life. Nonetheless, it remains a relatively neglected source of data within educational research. This article attempts to highlight the significance of the analysis of organised action within educational research. It describes and demonstrates an analytical approach to action applicable to the classroom developed from approaches to the analysis of bodily communication and action in drama education and from new approaches to rhetoric. These approaches draw on social semiotic theories of making meaning in order to describe the complex relationship between the semiotics of social action and the situated experience of learning in the classroom. This article describes how action realises meanings and shapes classroom interaction through the application of the schema to video data from a science lesson on energy with Year 9 pupils (14 years old). Finally, it draws attention to the research and pedagogical implications of a focus on action in the science classroom and in education more generally.;;;;;;"Jewitt, Carey/0000-0002-2971-984X; franks, anton/0000-0002-9144-3485";;;;;;;;;;;;;0141-1926;1469-3518;;;;APR;2001;27;2;;;;;201;218;;10.1080/01411920120037144;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01411920120037144;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000168009900007;View Full Record in Web of Science

Ethnographic video data of sibling caregiving interactions were collected, focusing on children ages three to 13 years interacting with their two-year-old siblings. Sibling relations in both cultures reflect a system of multiage play, the children's sensitivity to age and gender hierarchies, and the older siblings' role as teachers of their younger siblings. Differences in the two groups include more verbal exchanges and wordplay with the two-year-old Wolof children and more overt efforts by older Zinacantec siblings to incorporate the two year olds into their group activity. The data indicate an overall pattern of cultural transmission by which older siblings teach younger ones in the context of caring for them. The pattern is nuanced by each group's social organization and rules for social interaction, exhibited in the children's play.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0091-2131;1548-1352;;;;JUN;2003;31;2;;;;;204;231;;10.1525/eth.2003.31.2.204;http://dx.doi.org/10.1525/eth.2003.31.2.204;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000187999800003;View Full Record in Web of Science

A case study was conducted in a Finnish elementary school. 21 ten-year-old students participated in the study. Two types of data were collected: ( 1) Students self-reported questionnaires on achievement goals, ( 2) Video data on the students' learning processes and social interaction. The results revealed the importance of a situative perspective in instructional design, since the students not only differed in their coping attempts regarding their initial goals but also according to their individual situational interpretations that mediated their active coping attempts. Some of the non-learning-focused students had difficulties engaging in the working procedures. A lack of teacher's concrete and precise guidance in both cognitive and motivational sense appeared to explain this phenomenon.;;;;;Järvelä, Sanna M/B-4267-2013;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0020-4277;1573-1952;;;;JUL;2004;32;4;;;;;269;291;;10.1023/B:TRUC.0000026465.74406.47;http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:TRUC.0000026465.74406.47;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000221203300001;View Full Record in Web of Science

A range of teaching systems were found across higher-achieving countries that balanced attention to challenging content, procedural skill, and conceptual understanding in different ways. The United States displayed a unique system of teaching, not because of any particular feature but because of a constellation of features that reinforced attention to lower-level mathematics skills. The authors argue that these results are relevant for policy (mathematics) debates in the United States because they provide a current account of what actually is happening inside U.S. classrooms and because they demonstrate that current debates often pose overly simple choices. The authors suggest ways to learn from examining teaching systems that are not alien to U.S. teachers but that balance a skill emphasis with attention to challenging mathematics and conceptual development.;;;;;Jacobs, Jennifer/GYQ-5999-2022;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0162-3737;;;;;SUM;2005;27;2;;;;;111;132;;10.3102/01623737027002111;http://dx.doi.org/10.3102/01623737027002111;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000230839500001;View Full Record in Web of Science

J;Santagata, R;;;;Santagata, R;;;Practices and beliefs in mistake-handling activities: A video study of Italian and US mathematics lessons;TEACHING AND TEACHER EDUCATION;;;;;;;;;;;;Although psychological theories assign to mistakes a fundamental role in the learning process and suggest ways to deal with them, only few studies have analyzed ways teacher-student interactions surrounding mistakes occur in actual classroom settings. This study focuses on such analysis. Also examined here are cultural factors that inform teacher mistake-handling. The data include a sample of 30 Italian and 30 US videotaped eighth-grade mathematics lessons. The methodology combines a discourse analytic approach with quantification of some aspects of the interactions observed. The differences observed in Italian and US lessons are interpreted as a complex interplay of two elements: beliefs about learning and culturally specific instructional practices.

The treatment was introduced to 1500 eighth grade students in five middle schools selected for their ethnic, linguistic, and socioeconomic diversity. Students were given pre-, post-, and delayed posttests on a Conservation of Matter Assessment and measures of motivation and engagement. This quasi-experiment found statistically significant posttest results for achievement, basic learning engagement, and goal orientation. Analyses of disaggregated data showed that subgroups of students in the treatment condition outscored their comparison group peers (n = 1500) in achievement in all cases, except for students currently enrolled in ESOL. Analysis of video data of a diverse group of four students as the unit was enacted suggests that students entered a learning environment that permitted them to function in different, but consistent ways over time; that is, the frequency of students' manipulation of objects showed a different pattern of engagement for each of the four students compared with patterns of verbal responses such as the use of scientific terms. The results of this planning grant paved the way for a large study of the scale-up of highly rated curriculum units.

Teachers and researchers used an innovative research design developed through the InterActive Education Project (Sutherland et al., 2003). Video case studies were carried out in four classrooms, focusing on the use of interactive whiteboard technology for teaching and learning. The case studies were analysed using StudioCode, an analytic tool which allows researchers to mark and code segments of video data into categories and themes. Teachers developed coding systems drawing on the learning aims and objectives of their particular lessons. The case studies illustrate that the introduction of interactive whiteboards (IWBs) into the classroom involves much more than the physical installation of the board and software. Teachers are the critical agents in mediating the software, the integration of the software into the subject aims of the lesson and appropriate use of the IWB to promote quality interactions and interactivity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0013-1911;1465-3397;;;;NOV;2005;57;4;;;;;457;469;;10.1080/00131910500279551;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00131910500279551;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000233438800004;View Full Record in Web of Science

It is assumed that the analysis perspective is decisive for identifying variant and invariant teaching patterns. Therefore, we focused on three perspectives: (1) organisation of activities, (2) quality of teacher-student interactions, and (3) students' perception of learning conditions. The design included three lessons of two topics (13 classes x 2 topics x 3 lessons) that were videotaped in each class. The findings indicate variants in teaching for the organisation of activities. Invariants were identified for teacher-student interactions and the students' perception of learning conditions. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Students' procedural and conceptual problem solving in a CSCL environment designed within the field of science education;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER-SUPPORTED COLLABORATIVE LEARNING;;;;;;;;;;;;This article discusses the relationship between procedural and conceptual problem solving in a computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) environment designed within the field of science education. The contribution of this article, and our understanding of this phenomenon, is anchored in our socio-cultural interpretation, and that implies distinctive inputs for the design and re-design of these kinds of learning environments. We discuss institutional aspects linked to the school as a curriculum deliverer, as well as to the presentation of the knowledge domain and the construction of the CSCL environment. The data is gathered from a design experiment in a science setting in a secondary school, and video data is used to perform an interaction analysis. More specifically, we follow a group of four secondary school students who solve a biological problem in a computer-based 3D model supported by a website. Our findings are clear in the sense that the procedural types of problem solving tend to dominate the students' interactions, while conceptual knowledge construction is only present where it is strictly necessary to carry out the problem solving. Based on our analyses, we conclude that this can be explained partly by how the knowledge domain is presented and how the CSCL environment is designed, but that the main reason is linked to the institutional aspects related to the school as curriculum deliverer where its target is to secure that the students actually solve problems that are predefined in the syllabus list. We argue that this affords some particular challenges, linked to making conceptual knowledge constructions in science education explicit in the CSCL environment, and to encouraging the teachers and the school as a curriculum deliverer to give this kind of knowledge construction a prioritised value.;;;;;;Krange, Ingeborg/0009-0005-5946-0612;;;;;;;;;;;;;1556-1607;1556-1615;;;;MAR;2008;3;1;;;;;25;51;;10.1007/s11412-007-9030-4;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11412-007-9030-4;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000270086400003;View Full Record in Web of Science
J;Hill, ML;;;;Hill, Marc Lamont;;;Wounded Healing: Forming a Storytelling Community in Hip-Hop Lit;TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD;;;;;;;;;;;;Background/Context: Over the past 5 years, there has been a growing body of scholarship that examines the intersections of hip-hop culture and classroom pedagogy. Although recent scholarship has persuasively demonstrated the classroom potential of hip-hop texts for promoting student engagement, scaffolding sanctioned forms of knowledge, and nurturing critical consciousness and activism, little work has been done to unpack the complex relations of power that emerge in such classrooms. In particular, we know very little about the ways in which students and teachers are (re) positioned within classrooms that engage in hip-hop-centered pedagogy. This article contributes to the current literature in hip-hop based education, culturally relevant pedagogy, and critical pedagogy by examining the some of the issues and tensions that emerge when teachers engage in hip-hop-centered classroom pedagogy. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: This study details how the articulation of personal narratives within Hip-Hop Lit, a hip-hop-centered high school English literature course, produced a practice of wounded healing, in which people bearing the scars of suffering shared their stories in ways that provided a form of release and relief for themselves and others. This article highlights the complex relationships that students forged with the course's hip-hop texts, many of which resonated with their own lived experiences. I then illustrate how these relationships enabled the classroom discussions and interactions from which the practices of wounded healing emerged. Finally, I highlight some of the dilemmas and tensions that emerged as my coteacher and I attempted to privilege the stories and experiences of our students and ourselves within the classroom. Setting: Data for this study were collected at Howard High School, a small comprehensive urban high school in the northeastern United States. Research Design: Data for this 1-year ethnography were collected using field notes, formal and informal interviews, document analysis, and video data. Conclusions/Recommendations: This article shows how Hip-Hop Lit operated as a space in which members offered and responded to various types of individual and group narratives through the practice of wounded healing. Through this practice, students were able to recognize the commonality of their experiences, challenge various ideologies, and produce new knowledge. In doing this, the members of the class forged a cohesive community replete with multiple roles and relations of power. This article points to the need for critically interrogating the ostensible virtues of hip-hop-based education, as well as critical and culturally relevant pedagogies more broadly. This article also underscores the need for more ethnographic research that unpacks the complexities, contours, and contradictions of curricula, and pedagogy that responds to the lived experiences of students.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0161-4681;1467-9620;;;;;2009;111;1;;;;;248;293;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000269711000009;View Full Record in Web of Science

This fusion of two different groups of children, two different sets of expectations, is controversial: Is it possible to accomplish both goals at once, or will teacher and program inevitably end up serving the needs of dominant English-speaking children first? The equation is further complicated when the English speakers in a program come from mainly highly educated middle-class families, and the Spanish speakers come from mainly working-class immigrant families, as is the case in many of these programs. Drawing on audio and video data from a yearlong Study in a second-grade two-way classroom that shares this class gap between language groups, and using a methodology that fuses ethnography and discourse analysis, this article explores the ways English-speaking children can impact classroom conversational dynamics.;;;;;Palmer, Deborah/ADZ-2167-2022;Palmer, Deborah/0000-0003-4547-1589;;;;;;;;;;;;;0039-8322;1545-7249;;;;JUN;2009;43;2;;;;;177;202;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000268517400001;View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the process by which talk becomes text is less clear. The term 'oral rehearsal' is now commonplace in English classrooms and curriculum policy documents, yet as a concept it is not well theorised. Indeed, there is relatively little reference to the concept of oral rehearsal in the international literature, and what references do exist propose differing interpretations of the concept. At its most liberal, the term is used loosely as a synonym for talk; more precise definitions frame oral rehearsal, for example, as a strategy for reducing cognitive load during writing; for post-hoc reviewing of text; for helping writers to 'hear' their own writing; or for practising sentences aloud as a preliminary to writing them down. Drawing on a systematic review of the literature and video data from an empirical study, the paper will offer a theoretical conceptualisation of oral rehearsal, drawing on existing understanding of writing processes and will illustrate the ways in which young writers use oral rehearsal before and during writing.";;;;;;Myhill, Debra/0000-0002-3207-3859;;;;;;;;;;;;;0007-1005;;;;;SEP;2009;57;3;;;;;265;284;;10.1111/j.1467-8527.2009.00438.x;http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8527.2009.00438.x;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000269137500003;View Full Record in Web of Science

Infants' communicative gestures predict caregivers' responsiveness;INFANT BEHAVIOR & DEVELOPMENT;;;;;;;;;;;;"Infants' effects on adults are a little studied but important aspect of development. What do infants do that increases caregiver responsiveness in childcare environments? Infants' communicative behaviors (i.e. smiling, crying) affect mothers' responsiveness; and preschool children's language abilities affect teachers' responses in the classroom setting. However, the effects of infants' intentional communications on either parents' or non-parental caregivers' responsiveness have not been examined. Using longitudinal video data from an infant classroom where infant signing was used along with conventional gestures (i.e. pointing), this study examines whether infants' use of gestures and signs elicited greater responsiveness from caregivers during daily interactions. Controlling child age and individual child effects, infants' gestures and signs used specifically to respond to caregivers elicited more responsiveness from caregivers during routine interactions. Understanding the effects of infants' behaviors on caregivers is critical for helping caregivers understand and improve their own behavior towards children in their care. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

J;"Fleck, R; Fitzpatrick, G";;;;"Fleck, Rowanne; Fitzpatrick, Geraldine";;;Teachers' and tutors' social reflection around SenseCam images;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER STUDIES;;;;;;;;;;;;As photographic technologies continue to develop, so too do the social practices surrounding their use. The focus of this paper is on the social practices surrounding images captured from a new photographic device-SenseCam-which, rather than capturing individual images when triggered by the user, automatically captures a series of images. This paper is concerned with the use of SenseCam digital images in social contexts where there is a professional purpose-supporting the collaborative reflective practices of school teachers and university tutors as part of their professional development. Analysis of video data collected from 16 in-situ case studies of reflective discussions shows evidence that reflection took place as defined in the literature. Further the phototalk around SenseCam images was found to benefit reflection in these social situations through promotion of a rich shared understanding of the lesson context: supporting return to the experience, sharing of background context, grounding conversations, illustrating and providing evidence, and allowing people to see more. The paper concludes with a discussion on how different features of SenseCam images, such as variable quality, lack of audio and incompleteness, helped in this reflection or not. Finally implications from this work and participant's comments are used to suggest ways in which SenseCam may be used in the future in teachers' and tutors' social reflection. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The program consisted of a series of video-based modules designed to respond to needs of U. S. teachers, as highlighted by findings from the 1999 Third International Mathematics and Science Video Study. Sixty-four 6th-grade teachers from five low-performing inner-city schools participated in the study and were randomly assigned to treatment and control groups. Measures included fidelity of implementation, teacher knowledge and practice, and student mathematics learning. The program did not impact significantly teacher knowledge or practices as measured in the study. An effect was found on mathematics learning for students whose teachers reached a certain level of mathematics content knowledge. Discussion of findings includes lessons learned about conducting and studying professional development, particularly in low-performing schools.;;;;;"GAMBOA, THOMAS/A-4646-2011; Santagata, Rossella/K-4105-2019";Santagata, Rossella/0000-0003-1499-8556;;;;;;;;;;;;;1934-5747;1934-5739;;;;;2010;4;1;;;;;1;24;;10.1080/19345747.2010.498562;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19345747.2010.498562;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000208762500001;View Full Record in Web of Science

This study applies the content framework from the TIMSS Video Study to a sample of 28 3(rd) grade teachers enacting an inquiry-based unit on floating and sinking, and seeks a deeper understanding of teachers' practices through analysis of interviews with those teachers. Transcripts of observed lessons were coded according to the TIMSS framework for types of content, and transcripts of teacher interviews were coded to capture the ways in which teachers described their role in and purposes for teaching science, particularly with respect to the floating and sinking unit. Results indicate that teachers focused more on canonical, procedural and experimental knowledge during lessons than on real-world connections and the nature of science; however, none of the types of content received major emphasis in a majority of the classrooms in the sample. During interviews, teachers described their practice in ways that prioritized helping students to like science over specific content outcomes. The study suggests that elementary school teachers' emphasis on doing and feeling during inquiry-based lessons may interfere with teaching of content.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0157-244X;1573-1898;;;;MAY;2010;40;3;;;;;425;449;;10.1007/s11165-009-9128-y;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11165-009-9128-y;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000275989600007;View Full Record in Web of Science

The findings suggest that students engage in three types of talking aloud: (1) clarification of thinking (i.e. spontaneous utterances related to the mathematical task); (2) expressions of confusion (i.e. I don't understand!), with the explicit intent of eliciting support from peers; or (3) a combination of (1) and (2). The findings also show that students do not perceive other students' talking aloud as an inter-communicative gesture. This research highlights the importance emphasizing to students that talking aloud during peer collaborations should be viewed as a potential antecedent to communicative interaction and the importance of teaching students how to listen to one another.";;;;;;Kotsopoulos, Donna/0000-0002-0497-2064;;;;;;;;;;;;;1571-0068;1573-1774;;;;DEC;2010;8;6;;;;;1049;1070;;10.1007/s10763-010-9221-8;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10763-010-9221-8;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000292149200005;View Full Record in Web of Science

While this software has conventionally been used to produce quantitative results that can be subjected to statistical analyses, it will be argued that it can also assist in complementary qualitative analyses. Drawing upon data from a recent study of classroom discourse, the paper shows how a combination of systematic quantitative analysis and micro-ethnographic analysis can lead to a productive cycle of generating and testing hypotheses, maintaining qualitative and ethnographic insight while producing findings of a more generalisable kind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1364-5579;;;;;;2011;14;3;;;SI;;253;258;PII 937489088;10.1080/13645579.2011.563624;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13645579.2011.563624;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000290689200008;View Full Record in Web of Science

Using video data, field notes, and interview transcripts from I school year in two optimal case study classrooms, we were able to examine the unique opportunities afforded by the size of the IWB screen, the manipulation of virtual objects onscreen, and related communication using gestures. We: (i) established criteria for defining significant learning moments; (ii) assessed these significant learning moments to determine how the interactive whiteboard was supporting the learning; and (iii) isolated the use of gesture during IWB use to magnify the grain size of our analysis and understanding. The data fell into three types of IWB use: productive (89%), reproductive (2%), and problematic (9%).

A detailed empirical analysis of audio/video data collected in the context of Swiss training companies establishes that answers provided by trainers in response to questions do not constitute the dominant form of questioning work observed. Alternative interactional patterns that stress the tensions connected with questioning in the workplace context and the complexity of the social practices associated with workplace learning are identified and described. These findings illuminate the challenges faced by apprentices when joining the workplace and underscore the importance of a sociopragmatic perspective in addressing social issues related to initial vocational education.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1878-9714;1878-9722;;;;;2011;2;2;;;SI;;234;259;;10.1075/ps.2.2.06fil;http://dx.doi.org/10.1075/ps.2.2.06fil;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000208782500006;View Full Record in Web of Science

Yet education, especially in its teaching and learning practices, continues to treat knowledge as something that is necessarily and solely expressed in ideal verbal form. This study is part of a funded project that investigates the role of the body in knowing and learning mathematics. Based on a 3-week (15 1-h lessons) video study of 1-s grade mathematics classroom (N = 24), we identify 4 claims: (a) gestures support children's thinking and knowing, (b) gestures co-emerge with peers' gestures in interactive situations, (c) gestures cope with the abstractness of concepts, and (d) children's bodies exhibit geometrical knowledge. We conclude that children think and learn through their bodies. Our study suggests to educators that conventional images of knowledge as being static and abstract in nature need to be rethought so that it not only takes into account verbal and written languages and text but also recognizes the necessary ways in which children's knowledge is embodied in and expressed through their bodies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1571-0068;1573-1774;;;;FEB;2011;9;1;;;;;207;238;;10.1007/s10763-010-9240-5;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10763-010-9240-5;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000292149900010;View Full Record in Web of Science

The participants were 682 Grade 8 and 9 students from 37 classes from Germany and Switzerland who participated in a video study of lessons on the Pythagorean theorem. Control and value beliefs as well as autonomy support proved to be relevant predictors of positive affective experiences. Moreover, positive affective experiences were associated with more cognitive activity during the lessons, which for its part predicted achievement in the posttest. In a follow-up test, there was also an indirect effect of positive affective experiences on achievement, mediated by cognitive activity and expectancy of success. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Inquiry-based science education has proved its efficiency at both primary and secondary levels in increasing students' interest and attainments while at the same time stimulating teacher motivation. This paper presents an innovative way to introduce inquiry based methods in the science classroom using advanced technological applications. The Lab of Tomorrow system consists of a series of tiny, programmable devices that are embedded in clothing, footballs and other items. The system monitors the wearer's running pace, body temperature, heartbeat rate or the acceleration of a ball. This practical information can be translated into examples of science theory, raising interest and motivation among students, and improving the learning process. In this way student everyday activities are becoming a subject of experimentation. They personally experience the procedures involved in an authentic research project and thereby gain a far better understanding of science. This paper describes the systematic procedure that was adapted to monitor students' and teachers' activities while using the Lab of Tomorrow system. Four hundred students from 18 schools in Greece, Germany, Austria and Italy were involved in the study for a period of 8 months (one school year) during their science lessons. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected and analyzed in detail. The analysis of the findings demonstrates that there is significant improvement of the learning outcomes for the students in all cases in both physics and mathematics. Additionally, the outcomes of the extended lesson video study demonstrate that the Lab of Tomorrow system offers a great opportunity for teachers to adopt inquiry based methods in their lessons, and to implement teaching strategies for facilitating learning about scientific inquiry, developing the abilities of inquiry, and understanding scientific concepts and principles.;;;;;;Sotiriou, Sofoklis/0000-0001-8909-5963;;;;;;;;;;;;;1936-6612;;;;;NOV-DEC;2011;4;11-12;;;;;3317;3323;;10.1166/asl.2011.2041;http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/asl.2011.2041;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000302390200005;View Full Record in Web of Science

Physics instruction was analysed in the conceptual framework of opportunities to learn. The sample consisted of 62 lessons of physics taught at various lower-secondary schools in Brno, the Czech Republic.

The paper presents findings on: a) organisation of classroom activities; b) sequencing of the teaching process; c) using didactic tools and media; d) using experiments. The results show that lower-secondary physics instruction is teacher-oriented to a great extent, which is indicated by the organisation of classroom activities.

Drawing on two video-based, qualitative studies in which researchers utilized video records as resources to enhance reciprocity, this article explores how educators and researchers can negotiate relationships to make the research enterprise mutually beneficial. In particular, this article examines specific events where researchers and educators collaboratively analyzed video data, including video of the research team engaged in analytic conversations. The resulting conversations interrupted traditional boundaries between researchers and participants and yielded understandings that benefited both parties.

However, a few parts of studies analyse in great detail which students' learning processes are involved in physics classes during teaching, and how they are used. Following a socio-constructivist approach using tools coming from discourse analysis, we suggest studying three processes of students' learning: (1) establishing links between ideas, (2) increasing the domain of applicability of ideas, or (3) decreasing the domain of applicability of ideas. Our database consists of video data and written worksheets of two students at the upper-secondary school level (Grade 10 [15-year-old students]) during a one-month teaching sequence about gas. Based on semiotic resources contained in oral and written language, we reconstruct in great detail all the ideas about gas expressed by both students during the entire teaching sequence. Our analysis deals with (1) how learning processes are identified based on the ideas expressed by students, and (2) how the three learning processes are used by the two students during teaching. Our results show that during the teaching sequence: (1) the emergence of the networks of three ideas is supported by networks of two ideas expressed previously by students; (2) both students express more networks of two ideas than networks of three ideas; (3) the process 'increasing the domain of applicability' of an idea or a network of ideas is very often involved; and (4) the process 'decreasing the domain of applicability' of an idea or network of ideas is rarely used by them.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0950-0693;1464-5289;;;;;2012;34;2;;;;;223;249;;10.1080/09500693.2011.566289;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09500693.2011.566289;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000300301900004;View Full Record in Web of Science

A total of 46 in-service teachers were involved in this study (experimental group = 23, control group = 23). Pre- and post-intervention surveys were administered to examine possible changes in the participants' beliefs about education and science teaching efficacy. Video data were gathered through classroom observations of 9 participants from the experimental group and 9 participants from the control group. The results of one-way analysis of covariance indicate that the reported post-intervention beliefs of teachers who participated in the programme differed significantly from their pre-intervention beliefs. More specifically, teachers in the experimental groups reported fewer traditional and more constructivist beliefs after the intervention, as well as stronger personal science teaching efficacy beliefs. One exception included beliefs about science teaching outcome expectancy.

J;Arnold, J;;;;Arnold, Jenny;;;Science Stuldents' Cassroom Discourse: Tasha's Umwelt;RESEARCH IN SCIENCE EDUCATION;;;;;;;;;;;;Over the past twenty-five years researchers have been concerned with understanding the science student. The need for such research is still grounded in contemporary issues including providing opportunities for all students to develop scientific literacy and the failure of school science to connect with student's lives, interests and personal identities. The research reported here is unusual in its use of discourse analysis in social psychology to contribute to an understanding of the way students make meaning in secondary school science. Data constructed for the study was drawn from videotapes of nine consecutive lessons in a year-seven science classroom in Melbourne, post-lesson video-stimulated interviews with students and the teacher, classroom observation and the students' written work. The classroom videotapes were recorded using four cameras and seven audio tracks by the International Centre for Classroom Research at the University of Melbourne. Student talk within and about their science lessons was analysed from a discursive perspective. Classroom episodes in which students expressed their sense of personal identity and agency, knowledge, attitude or emotion in relation to science were identified for detailed analysis of the function of the discourse used by students, and in particular the way students were positioned by others or positioned themselves. This article presents the discursive Umwelt or life-space of one middle years science student, Tasha. Her case is used here to highlight the complex social process of meaning making in science classrooms and the need to attend to local moral orders of rights and duties in research on student language use, identity and learning in science.;;;;;Martin, Jenny/Q-7252-2019;Martin, Jenny/0000-0002-1460-4441;;;;;;;;;;;;;0157-244X;1573-1898;;;;APR;2012;42;2;;;;;233;259;;10.1007/s11165-010-9195-0;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11165-010-9195-0;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000301593200005;View Full Record in Web of Science

Relative age effects highlight an erroneous process of initial and on-going player assessment, based largely on subjective opinions of game performance. A more objective assessment of each player's progress by measuring essential skills during practice is warranted to guide and improve coaching and assessment of talented children. Purpose: To measure the effects of the coaching intervention on performance and learning during a group technical practice. A second purpose was to repeatedly measure each player's passing, first touch and an awareness response and to measure the reliability of peer assessment as an immediate source of objective feedback. Setting: Weekly coaching sessions at an English professional soccer club academy. A total of 22 practices occurred during the second half of a soccer season. Participants: Academy boys aged 10-12 years, with five players participating throughout the study. The coach was a European 'A' licence holder and an experienced physical education teacher. Intervention: The coach and players defined the practice requirements and how to perform each skill successfully. Players were taught to observe, assess and record the performance of their peers. After the practice, players charted their objective scores and bonus game play was awarded based on self-set goal attainment. Research design: A single-subject, multiple-baseline experiment was used to assess the effects of the intervention on performance of the three skills and the reliability of the performance measures. The design and intervention enabled the repeated measurement of all players' performance and learning during each phase and condition of the experiment. Data collection and analysis: Baseline data were collected from video recording of practice and intervention data were collected from recording and live by a player and the coach. Percent correct scores for each skill were plotted on graphs for visual analysis. Agreements between live and primary video data were calculated to evaluate the reliability of peer-assessed scores. Findings: The intervention was shown to improve the level and consistency of performance in all five participants, which, for most players and skills, was maintained when the intervention was removed. Players were willing and able to reliably assess their peers and collect objective data on each player's performance. They enjoyed receiving and charting their scores and reported a greater confidence in these skills in competitive situations. Conclusions: The findings suggest this formal accountability, feedback and reinforcement procedure provides a promising method to maximise practice and learning and accurately assess the progress of talented youth soccer players.

J;Hobbs, L;;;;Hobbs, Linda;;;Examining the aesthetic dimensions of teaching: Relationships between teacher knowledge, identity and passion;TEACHING AND TEACHER EDUCATION;;;;;;;;;;;;Having an appreciation for the subject, their students and what the subject can offer their students has both cognitive and emotional dimensions for teachers. This paper uses empirical data to explore the efficacy of a Deweyan inspired framework called Aesthetic Understanding to scrutinise relationships between teacher knowledge, identity and passion. The paper uses case study data of three teachers of maths and/or science generated from a video study to illustrate the relationships between the three elements of Aesthetic Understanding. The need to value the aesthetic dimensions of teaching when examining the subject-specific nature of secondary teaching is discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

J;"Remedios, L; Clarke, D; Hawthorne, L";;;;"Remedios, Louisa; Clarke, David; Hawthorne, Lesleyanne";;;Learning to listen and listening to learn: one student's experience of small group collaborative learning;AUSTRALIAN EDUCATIONAL RESEARCHER;;;;;;;;;;;;The dialogic nature of small group collaborative learning requires verbal contributions from students to progress individual and group learning. Speaking can become privileged over listening as a collaborative act, and an imbalance in these values can become embedded in the classroom culture to the degree that the core value of listening can be invisible to students new to the learning contexts. The focus of this paper is a single case study of the experience of an international Asian-background student (Korean), learning in a Western (Australian) problem-based learning (PBL) physiotherapy context. Video data and interviews highlight his difficulty with learning to listen and listening to learn, and his privileging of speaking over listening. We question whether failure to signal the importance of listening is the result of the current shift in emphasis to learning through speaking, leading to a subsequent loss of attention to the role of listening in collaborative learning. Further, we question the cultural inclusivity of the PBL educational paradigm and recommend specific tutor training on scaffolding students' listening skills in this dialogic learning context.;;;;;;Remedios, Louisa/0000-0002-8021-7327;;;;;;;;;;;;;0311-6999;2210-5328;;;;AUG;2012;39;3;;;;;333;348;;10.1007/s13384-012-0064-x;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13384-012-0064-x;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000305988200005;View Full Record in Web of Science

Basic principles of cognitive psychology dictate that much of this information is likely to be forgotten. Exactly how much and what type of information can be retained and recalled remains an open question. Methods: With Institutional Review Board approval, 98 healthy, educated volunteers viewed a brief video containing a preoperative explanation of anesthetic options and instructions. Subjects were then asked to engage in free and cued recall of information from the video, and to complete a recognition task. We developed a coding scheme to objectively score the free and cued recall tasks for the quantity of information recalled relative to the quantity presented in the video. Data are presented as descriptive statistics. Results: Subjects spontaneously recalled less than 25% of the information presented. Providing retrieval cues greatly enhanced recall: Subjects recalled 67%, on average, of the material queried in the cued recall task. Performance was even stronger on the multiple-choice test (83% of items correctly answered), indicating that the information was initially encoded. The category of information that was consistently least-remembered was presurgical medication instructions. Conclusions: Under realistic conditions for recall, most medical instruction given to patients will not be recalled, even if it is initially encoded. Given the limits of short-term memory, clinicians should carefully consider their patterns of information giving. Improvement of memory performance with cues for retrieval indicates that providing printed instructions for later review may be beneficial.;;;;;;Sandberg, Warren/0000-0002-9246-777X;;;;;;;;;;;;;0003-3022;1528-1175;;;;OCT;2012;117;4;;;;;772;779;;10.1097/ALN.0b013e31826a4b02;http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/ALN.0b013e31826a4b02;;;;;;;;22902965;;;;;WOS:000309113100012;View Full Record in Web of Science

Using video data, moments of engagement were examined in a child with autism spectrum disorder during the daily classroom activity of Circle Time. The interpretive frame focused on mediated action, the interaction between the agent, and cultural tools. Three scenes were analyzed using narrative and micro-analytic strategies. Analyses of two scenes highlighted how social and material mediators offer opportunities for engagement. Other children with autism provided appropriate scaffolds and demonstrated evidence of intersubjectivity, whereas material tools provided proximal prompts that enabled the child to engage. The third scene suggests that engagement may not always be observable (i.e., engagement may be a subjective state).

Unfortunately, researchers often experience uncertainty about incorporating video into their methodological approach as it can present a potential minefield of operational, technical, and ethical issues that require consideration and negotiation. Nevertheless, with the increased emphasis on the use of digital technologies, the timing is right to engage in more in-depth discussions about the role of video data in education research. In contributing to this discussion, this article unpacks several issues connected to the use of video technology as a tool for data collection and analysis. This article focuses on addressing some of the barriers faced by education researchers such as making sampling decisions, maintaining research authenticity, and grappling with ethical issues that arise. In terms of the advantages for researchers, this article highlights the suitability of video technology for classroom-based research because it provides a permanent and detailed record, which can be analyzed from multiple perspectives. These issues are explained through the experiences of an education researcher, who used video as the main data source for documenting and examining the practices of two effective primary science teachers in Perth, Western Australia.;;;;;Dawson, Vaille M/I-4231-2014;"Dawson, Vaille M/0000-0003-1754-9086; Fitzgerald, Angela/0000-0001-8010-2215";;;;;;;;;;;;;1609-4069;;;;;;2013;12;;;;;;52;64;;10.1177/160940691301200127;http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/160940691301200127;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000326863800004;View Full Record in Web of Science

This study focuses on the verbal behaviors of peer leaders, who serve as de facto teachers in a college chemistry teaching reform based on cooperative learning. Video data obtained throughout a semester of General Chemistry I from two different peer leaders, each interacting with a different group of students, was subjected to two rounds of qualitative data analysis. First, Toulmin's argumentation scheme was used to characterize the arguments constructed by group members during peer leader intervention. Next, verbal behaviors exhibited by the peer leaders during intervention were examined. Findings of this study showed that peer leaders used an array of verbal behaviors to guide students to build chemistry knowledge, and that a relationship existed between student argument components and peer leader verbal behaviors, with data most frequently emerging in response to short questions from the peer leader, and warrants in response to probing and clarifying questions. The findings from this study have implications for professional development of teachers at all levels, specifically for demonstrating the interplay between group intervention strategies and student discourse within cooperative learning groups.;;;;;"Lewis, Jennifer E/F-8730-2011; Kulatunga, Ushiri/HZI-2345-2023";"Lewis, Jennifer E/0000-0001-9910-3007; Kulatunga, Ushiri/0000-0001-7404-598X";;;;;;;;;;;;;1109-4028;1756-1108;;;;;2013;14;4;;;;;576;588;;10.1039/c3rp00081h;http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3rp00081h;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000325570900019;View Full Record in Web of Science

Two studies were conducted to tackle these questions. The cognition, usage, and expansion (CUE) model was proposed based on the findings obtained from study 1 and then implemented and evaluated in study 2. The findings of study 2 indicated that the activities run in the CUE model were effective at motivating CFL beginners and improving their oral communication and social interactions. Based on the video data analysis, three criteria were proposed for designing learning activities.

The sample included (N = 1378) students from 81 randomly selected high-school physics classrooms in Germany and the German-speaking part of Switzerland. At the beginning of the school year, the following student characteristics were assessed: cognitive abilities, pre-knowledge, self-concept, and interest. Each student was classified as having one of five profiles previously identified by Seidel (2006). Classroom instruction was videotaped four months after student characteristics were assessed. The videotaped classroom interactions were coded and analyzed with respect to the students' profiles. Multilevel analysis indicated the highest amount of verbal engagement for girls and boys with high-level cognitive and motivational-affective characteristics. There are significant interactions between student profile and gender for girls with high-level characteristics. We argue that the interaction between gender and other characteristics is a valuable predictor of verbal engagement in physics instruction. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

However, many in-service programs for inquiry teaching have reported inconsistent results due to the static view of classroom inquiries and due to the partial perspective between individual and collaborative reflections. Thus, by means of a theoretical progress model of collaborative reflection, this qualitative research aims to investigate reflections of four participant teachers before and during a half-year in-service teacher program. The model captures the following four interactions for each individual teacher and among the teacher cohort: belief to practice, practice to belief, stimulation, and reinforcement. The audio-video data and their quantification allowed identification of the teachers' consistent prior beliefs and practices as a multiplicity of inquiry teaching and their interwoven progress during the program. The findings are further discussed in terms of the implicit development and the richer repertoire.;;;;;"Juuti, Kalle/IVU-8618-2023; Holbrook, Jack/A-8415-2015";"Juuti, Kalle/0000-0001-8696-2611; Holbrook, Jack/0000-0002-1642-8701; Lavonen, Jari/0000-0003-2781-7953; Rannikmae, Miia/0000-0001-7265-3009";;;;;;;;;;;;;1571-0068;1573-1774;;;;APR;2013;11;2;;;;;359;383;;10.1007/s10763-012-9341-4;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10763-012-9341-4;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000316352600004;View Full Record in Web of Science

J;Herrle, M;;;;Herrle, Matthias;;;Classroom management beyond school teaching - Microethnographic analysis of classroom flow control in adult education and vocational training;ZEITSCHRIFT FUR ERZIEHUNGSWISSENSCHAFT;;;;;;;;;;;;To enable teaching to take place as a teacher-learner interaction, the participants must mutually coordinate their behaviour. The teaching staff in particular are expected to take responsibility for the results of such coordination processes, i.e. for the sequence of activities which take place from one moment to the next in lessons. But how do they manage to control the actions of the learners and thus create (dis)continuity in the lessons? This question, which is rooted in the tradition of classroom management, is all the more relevant if the learners cannot be assumed to be willing to comply or if compliance cannot be easily demanded-which applies to some extent to teaching events for adults. In this article, the results of a microethnographic video study are presented to show the methods which the participants use at the beginning of adult and vocational education courses to influence the actions of other persons. A case study is used to illustrate how the teacher deals with problems in classroom flow control by the contextually appropriate use of various regulation methods, and thus plays a role in creating the (dis)continuity which shapes the sequence of events in the lessons. This especially underlines the potential of non-verbal forms of expression to herald a change of activities. This approach to research involves a shift in the perspective of adult education professionalism research from the ex-post analysis of professional knowledge to the in-situ observation of professional skills. With the aid of video-based (micro-)ethnographic approaches, the forms which the teaching staff routinely use to deal with specific action requirements are made visible with a high degree of empirical resolution. This extends the application of ethnographic methods. The classroom management discourse from school teaching is brought into a theoretical and empirical dialogue with course and interaction research in adult education. And finally, this creates a basis which enables the appropriateness of educational action variants to be discussed in an empirically meaningful way in the light of normative teaching theories.;;;;;Herrle, Matthias/HHC-1369-2022;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1434-663X;1862-5215;;;;SEP;2013;16;3;;;;;599;627;;10.1007/s11618-013-0376-2;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11618-013-0376-2;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000324106700007;View Full Record in Web of Science

Analysis involved nonparametric tests and thematic analysis of interview and video data. Cost was calculated for the group and per survivor. Survivors achieved significant gains in knowledge/skills, made further disclosures, and were positive about their program experience. No gains were identified in the control group. Costs were small.

Qualitative analysis of expert clinical practice;EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY AND REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY;;;;;;;;;;;;Objective: To identify the decision-making process involved in determining when to intervene, where to deliver and the optimal choice of instrument for operative vaginal deliveries in the second stage of labour. Study design: A qualitative study using interviews and video recordings took place at two university teaching hospitals (St. Michael's Hospital Bristol and Ninewells Hospital, Dundee). Ten obstetricians and eight midwives were identified as experts in conducting or supporting operative vaginal deliveries. Semi-structured interviews were carried out using routine clinical scenarios. The experts were also video recorded conducting low cavity vacuum and mid-cavity rotational forceps deliveries in a simulation setting. The interviews and video recordings were transcribed verbatim and analysed using thematic coding. The anonymised data were independently coded by three researchers and then compared for consistency of interpretation. The experts reviewed the coded interview and video data for respondent validation and clarification. The themes that emerged following the final coding were used to identify the decision-making process when planning and conducting an operative vaginal delivery. Key decision points were reported in selecting when and where to conduct an operative vaginal delivery and which instrument to use. Results: The final decision-making list highlights the various decision points to consider when performing an operative vaginal delivery. We identified clinical factors that experts take into consideration when selecting where the delivery should take place and the preferred choice of instrument. Conclusion: This detailed illustration of the decision-making process could aid trainees' understanding of the approach to safe operative vaginal delivery, aiming to minimise morbidity.

J;"Patchen, T; Smithenry, DW";;;;"Patchen, Terri; Smithenry, Dennis W.";;;Framing Science in a New Context: What Students Take Away From a Student-Directed Inquiry Curriculum;SCIENCE EDUCATION;;;;;;;;;;;;Student-directed inquiry in science is an important mechanism for helping students develop a repertoire of practices that reflects the work of real scientists. But few studies consider what students take away from this type of instruction, i.e., how strategies developed in such curricula transfer into other contexts. Our research addresses this gap by examining how strategies cultivated in a yearlong chemistry curriculum (the originating context) appeared (absent teacher intervention) in a new context with new peers. Dependent upon Lobato's actor-oriented transfer perspective (2006), this mixed-methods study deploys a multilevel analysis of video data collected in six physics classrooms (the new context) during a researcher-designed activity. Results show that absent teacher directives, two classes partially attempted to frame the physics inquiry using strategies cultivated in the original context, and one fully framed the new context using these strategies. This class's successful use of a specific focusing phenomenon (electing student managers) appeared as the key component in this full framing. Significantly, we found that a carefully designed inquiry curriculum can support students' capacity to (a) organize to work collaboratively, (b) communicate to engage all students in the inquiry investigation, and (c) conduct scientific work that meets disciplinary requirements.

J;Grimminger, E;;;;Grimminger, Elke;;;Sport motor competencies and the experience of social recognition among peers in physical education - a video-based study;PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND SPORT PEDAGOGY;;;;;;;;;;;;"Background: Being recognized as a competent and accepted member in the peer group is one of the most important basic human needs for children and youth. However, it is the peer group itself that decides which competencies are estimated and which are not, and through this process, a social order as well as peer power constellations is created.Purpose: This study aimed to determine if and how sport motor competencies are used as a criterion for the experience of recognition or non-recognition among peers in physical education (PE). Therefore, a mixed-method study was conducted.Data collection: The data set includes video data from six different school classes (a total of 59 video sequences) and 40 video-stimulated recall interviews with children who experience non-recognition or with children who transmit non-recognition. In addition, sociograms were included, as well as PE teachers' ratings of their students' sport motor competencies.Findings: A correlation analysis shows that sport motor competencies and the sociometric position in the peer group are significantly intercorrelated (r=0.50, p0.01). But a gender-differentiated analysis reveals that this finding is only valid for boys in their boys' peer group (r=0.60, p0.01), not for girls in their girls' peer group. The analysis of the video data based on the sociogram, interview, and sport motor rating data as validation methods identifies three contexts in PE classes where children refer to sport motor competencies to transmit recognition or non-recognition: (1) Children with relatively better motor skills draw attention to children with relatively poor motor skills in a humiliating manner by using publicizing strategies. The motor deficits of the concerned children are obviously focused upon on the social stage of the class. (2) Sport motor accidents can commonly happen to anyone regardless of the sport motor competencies offering an opportunity for practices of differentiation: sport motor accidents of popular children are positively focused upon and celebrated, even in competitive situations, while sport motor accidents of unpopular children in competitive situations lead to publicly demonstrated anger and to the loss of their positions and functions. Children use these situations as an opportunity to demonstrate social networks and affiliation borders as they do in the third context. (3) The social validation of sport motor successes is not only the recognition of good performance of a classmate, but also the acknowledgment of being significant for the successful student, as successful students only accept the recognizing acts of selective classmates; social relationships are publicly demonstrated. In conclusion, sport motor competencies play an important role in the everyday struggles of children for recognition in their peer group.";;;;;;Grimminger-Seidensticker, Elke/0000-0002-0932-3100;;;;;;;;;;;;;1740-8989;1742-5786;;;;NOV 1;2013;18;5;;;;;506;519;;10.1080/17408989.2012.690387;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17408989.2012.690387;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000326221600004;View Full Record in Web of Science

An example of this can be found in Kilifi in Kenya where the role of speech and language therapy has been taken on by occupational therapists and teachers. AimsTo investigate the communication practices used by these professional groups to support children with complex communication needs in a rural part of Kenya and to explore the ways in which this might be seen to facilitate or obstruct improved communication by asking the following questions: What are the critical features of interactional discourse in practitioner-child dyads with caregiver-child dyads providing a natural comparison? What communicative modalities and practice techniques are invoked? And how does this information relate to extending professional roles? Methods & ProceduresAn in-depth, descriptive study of a case series was conducted in a school for deaf children and the occupational therapy department of a district general hospital. A mixed methodology was used involving naturalistic observation and applied linguistics analysis. A convenience sample was established comprising six practitioner-child dyads assigned to partnership types: (A) three children with hearing impairment and their teachers; and (B) three children with cerebral palsy and their occupational therapists. As a natural comparator, the same three children in B were also observed with their mothers (partnership typeC). Dyadic interaction was video recorded on three occasions. The video data were sampled, transcribed into standard orthography and translated. Codes were applied to determine turn structure, linguistic move types and communicative modalities. Sequential analysis was conducted on the move types. Outcomes & ResultsPartnership typeA dyads showed a fairly even turn distribution between teacher and child. A common pattern was teacher-initiated Instruct and Model/Prompt, followed by child response in the form of an Action. The most frequently used modality was Sound Production and Hands-on-Articulators, which corresponded to articulation drill practice. Partnership typeB dyads revealed a tendency towards adult domination of turns. The majority of adult-initiated moves required no response from the child. The practice technique Hands-on-Articulators involved manipulating the oral musculature of the child. Partnership typeC dyads showed resonances of typeB dyads, although focused more on Motor-Action in relation to task performance. Conclusions & ImplicationsThe assignment of speech and language therapy duties to teachers and occupational therapists has resulted in suboptimal practice for children with complex communication needs.";;;;;"Newton, Charles/V-7872-2019; Newton, Charles RJC/B-7578-2014";"Newton, Charles/0000-0002-6999-5507; Newton, Charles RJC/0000-0002-6999-5507; Buell, Susan/0000-0002-1496-6557; Bunning, Karen/0000-0002-7396-9205";;;;;;;;;;;;;1368-2822;1460-6984;;;;NOV;2013;48;6;;;;;689;702;;10.1111/1460-6984.12042;http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1460-6984.12042;;;;;;;;24165365;;;;;WOS:000326057500008;View Full Record in Web of Science

A coding scheme based on Toulmin's [Toulmin [1958] The uses of argument. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press] argumentation model was used for identifying arguments during group work without instructor intervention. A modification of the framework developed by Erduran et al. [Erduran, Simon, & Osborne [2004] Science Education, 88(6), 915-933] for characterizing arguments was employed that considered both the strength of the argument and whether an argument contained contributions from one or more than one student. Data were collected by video recording weekly peer-led sessions with a focus on two small groups. Analysis of this video data with the coding scheme and the framework revealed that students were mostly engaged in co-constructed arguments, with more than one student providing evidence and reasoning during group activities. Students often supported their claims with data and warrants but rarely offered backings. That is, they supported their answers with evidence and reasoning but did not often elaborate on their reasoning or further validate their explanations. However, the percentage of arguments containing backings increased when arguments contained contributions from more than one student rather than being presented by one individual. Another significant finding is that students were able to resolve wrong claims through argumentation without peer leader intervention, an indication of independent learning.

However, patients' attitudes towards these interventions and comfort in participating in the recommended behaviours remain largely unexplored. Objective To evaluate patients' attitudes towards a video and leaflet aimed at encouraging patient involvement in safety-related behaviours. Design Two exploratory studies employing a within-subjects mixed-methods design. Setting Six hospital wards on an inner-city London teaching hospital. Participants Medical and surgical inpatients: 80 patients in study 1 (mean age 55; 69% men) and 80 patients in study 2 (mean age 52; 60% men). Intervention Patients watched the PINK patient safety video (study 1) or read the National Patient Safety Agency's Please Ask' about staying in hospital leaflet (study 2). Main outcome measures Perceived comfort in participating in safety-related behaviours; attitudes towards the video or leaflet. Results Both video and leaflet increased patients' perceived comfort in engaging in some (but not all) safety-related behaviours (P<0.05). In both studies, the majority of patients questioned whether the intervention could help to reduce medical errors in health care. Suggestions on how the video/leaflet could be improved mainly related to content and layout. Conclusion Video and leaflet could be effective at encouraging patient involvement in some safety-related behaviours. Further in-depth research on patients' attitudes towards different educational materials is required to help inform future policies and interventions in this very important but under-researched area.";;;;;"Sevdalis, Nick/O-1419-2017; Vincent, Charles A/D-1134-2010; Sevdalis, Nick/AAJ-6280-2020";"Sevdalis, Nick/0000-0001-7560-8924; Vincent, Charles A/0000-0003-0270-0222; Sevdalis, Nick/0000-0001-7560-8924";;;;;;;;;;;;;1369-6513;1369-7625;;;;DEC;2013;16;4;;;;;E164;E176;;10.1111/j.1369-7625.2011.00725.x;http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1369-7625.2011.00725.x;;;;;;;;22151624;;;;;WOS:000330180400007;View Full Record in Web of Science

Collaborative work of 22 higher education students was followed during a three-month course. All face-to-face group sessions were videotaped (33 h), and cued retrospective recall interviews (with video stimulus) were conducted. The results indicate the differences between the groups with respect to the amount and the types of challenges. One case group was chosen (one that experienced more and particularly socio-emotional challenges) for the in-depth interaction analysis. Their overruling, status-centric, undermining and normative interaction created a socio-emotional conflict. Students were unable to maintain a well-balanced atmosphere, which led them to adopt avoidance-focused emotion regulation behaviour and to lower their on-task engagement. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The USA and Germany are two countries with large formal education systems whose students underperform those from peers on internationally administered standardized science assessments. However, evidence from the 2011 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Exam assessment suggests fourth-grade students (9-10 year-olds) in the USA perform higher than those in Germany, despite more instructional time devoted to elementary science in Germany. The purpose of this study is to comparatively analyze fourth-grade classroom science in both countries to learn more about how teachers and students engage in scientific inquiry, particularly explanation-construction. Videorecordings of US and German science instruction (n(1) = 42, n(2) = 42) were sampled from existing datasets and analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively. Despite German science lessons being, on average, twice as long as those in the USA, study findings highlight many similarities between elementary science in terms of scientific practices and features of scientific inquiry. However, they also illustrate crucial differences around the scientific practice of explanation-construction. While students in German classrooms were afforded more substantial opportunities to formulate evidence-based explanations, US classrooms were more strongly characterized by opportunities for students to actively compare and evaluate evidence-based explanations. These factors may begin to help account for observed differences in student achievement and merit further study grounded in international collaboration.;;;;;"; Zangori, Laura/T-4898-2017";"Forbes, Cory/0000-0003-2230-4251; Biggers, Mandy/0000-0003-2757-4592; Zangori, Laura/0000-0002-7512-5559";;;;;;;;;;;;;0950-0693;1464-5289;;;;;2014;36;14;;;;;2367;2390;;10.1080/09500693.2014.923950;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09500693.2014.923950;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000339386000004;View Full Record in Web of Science
J;"Elia, I; Evangelou, K";;;;"Elia, Iliada; Evangelou, Kyriacoulla";;;Gesture in a kindergarten mathematics classroom;EUROPEAN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION RESEARCH JOURNAL;;;;;;;;;;;;Recent studies have advocated that mathematical meaning is mediated by gestures. This case study explores the gestures kindergarten children produce when learning spatial concepts in a mathematics classroom setting. Based on a video study of a mathematical lesson in a kindergarten class, we concentrated on the verbal and non-verbal behavior of one kindergartner who produced a great amount of gestures during instruction. The microgenetic approach was used for the analysis of the data. The results showed that the kindergartner used gestures throughout the whole instruction. For all the spatial concepts that were addressed ('in' and 'out', 'on' and 'under', 'up' and 'down'), he produced mainly deictic gestures referring either to existing or virtual objects. The child was found to produce different types of gestures in different spatial contexts. Our analysis revealed the occurrence of a gesture-speech match and a gesture-speech mismatch. In the latter case, the child's gestures were found to complement and enrich his verbal utterances. The child's gestures along with his speech acted as semiotic means of objectification of specific spatial relations that were rather abstract for the child and were not represented adequately by speech. Besides the phenomenon of the coordination between oral speech and gesture, enacted by the child himself, evidence was found for the coordination between the two semiotic systems activated by different people, that is, the child under study and the other children or the teacher of the class. Furthermore, the teacher's gestures were found to influence the child's gestures in different ways. These findings are discussed and suggestions for further research on the role of gestures in the development of spatial thinking in the early years are drawn.;;;;;;Elia, Iliada/0000-0002-0072-4178;;;;;;;;;;;;;1350-293X;1752-1807;;;;;2014;22;1;;;;;45;66;;10.1080/1350293X.2013.865357;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1350293X.2013.865357;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000337234000004;View Full Record in Web of Science

Consequently, we know very little about the quality of the feedback secondary school students can produce and its potential usefulness. This study was implemented in the context of reciprocal online peer assessment of web-portfolios in a secondary school science course. We evaluated both quantitative (grades) and qualitative (written comments) feedback on student science web-portfolios to assess the quality of peer feedback. We further investigated whether either peer or expert feedback led peer assesses to revise their work in any way. Participants (28 seventh-graders) anonymously assessed each other's web-portfolios on designing a CO2-friendly house. Peer assessors and an expert assessor used the same pre-specified assessment criteria. Peer assessees made revisions as they saw fit after reviewing the feedback. The data sources were: the feedback produced, screen capture and video data and questionnaires. The quantitative feedback was found to differ between peer assessors and the expert and also between peer assessors assessing the same web-portfolio, which resulted in low validity and reliability. Qualitative written feedback from student and expert assessors appeared similar in its structural components. It differed in that students placed less emphasis on peer assessees' skills, provided fewer suggestions for changes, provided more positive judgments, and provided more negative/critical judgments that were not accompanied by evidence. Finally, we found that the majority of changes proposed by peer assessors were scientifically accurate and assessee groups employed decision-making strategies to screen and process peer and expert feedback. These findings yield a number of implications for practice and policy. The mere explanation of the assessment criteria or prior experience with peer assessment procedures is not enough; teachers, researchers and policy makers should focus on the type of training and scaffolding that peer assessors need in order to produce high quality feedback.

In this study, we investigated how teacher questions and feedback in relation to individual student characteristics and gender predict cognitive learning activity and intrinsic learning motivation. The sample included N = 79 randomly selected high school physics classrooms in Germany and Switzerland. Individual student characteristics (cognitive abilities, pre-knowledge, self-concept, and interest) were assessed at the beginning of the school year to identify five student profiles. Four months later, a teaching unit was videotaped in the same classrooms. After the teaching unit was videotaped, a questionnaire on cognitive learning activity and intrinsic learning motivation was administered. Two-level hierarchical models showed that deep-reasoning teacher questions and feedback positively predicted both dependent variables and the student profiles revealed predictive power for both aspects. Girls reported less cognitive learning activity. Our results indicate that teaching skills should be fostered to enhance teachers in asking questions and providing feedback. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Little is known about how nurses and surgeons achieve this. The aim of the present study was to explore what factors affect this routine-like task, resulting in fast or slow transfer of objects. Methods: A qualitative video study, informed by an observational ethnographic approach, was conducted in a major teaching hospital in the UK. A total of 20 general surgical operations were observed. In total, approximately 68 h of video data have been reviewed. A subsample of 225 min has been analysed in detail using interactional video-analysis developed within the social sciences. Results: Two factors affecting object transfer were observed: (1) relative instrument trolley position and (2) alignment. The scrub nurse's instrument trolley position (close to vs. further back from the surgeon) and alignment (gaze direction) impacts on the communication with the surgeon, and consequently, on the speed of object transfer. When the scrub nurse was standing close to the surgeon, and converged to follow the surgeon's movements, the transfer occurred more seamlessly and faster (<1.0s) than when the scrub nurse was standing further back from the surgeon and did not follow the surgeon's movements (>1.0s). Conclusions: The smoothness of object transfer can be improved by adjusting the scrub nurse's instrument trolley position, enabling a better monitoring of surgeon's bodily conduct and affording early orientation (awareness) to an upcoming request (changing situation). Object transfer is facilitated by the surgeon's embodied practices, which can elicit the nurse's attention to the request and, as a response, maximise a faster object transfer. A simple intervention to highlight the significance of these factors could improve communication in the operating theatre. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Thus have scholars advocated for more explicit attention to connection-making, or integration, in teaching and learning. However, conceptual and empirical work to guide such efforts is limited. This study analyzed classroom processes to determine what connections educators promoted in their classrooms and how those connections were made. A qualitative, focused ethnography design explored connection-making in a health science curriculum. Eight instructors were observed during ten class sessions resulting in 35 h of video data. Video data were entered into the observational software, Noldus Observer, and coded using continuous sampling. Frequency and duration of connections made were calculated in Noldus. Connection-making involved four interactive elements: The topic under direct consideration, other domains of professional knowledge (practice, student experience, research, theory, other content, core construct of the profession, external influences, metacognition), the integrative processes instructors used to connect a topic to other knowledge domains (informal example, stories, questioning, linking statements, formal cases, and program descriptions), and the learning and instructor context (type and purpose of course, instructor personal and professional experience). These elements are presented as an initial integrative learning taxonomy that can be used to guide explicit attention to connection-making in education and research.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1382-4996;1573-1677;;;;OCT;2014;19;4;;;;;469;495;;10.1007/s10459-013-9481-5;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10459-013-9481-5;;;;;;;;24452442;;;;;WOS:000342209800002;View Full Record in Web of Science
J;"Haug, BS; Odegaard, M";;;;"Haug, Berit S.; Odegaard, Marianne";;;From Words to Concepts: Focusing on Word Knowledge When Teaching for Conceptual Understanding Within an Inquiry-Based Science Setting;RESEARCH IN SCIENCE EDUCATION;;;;;;;;;;;;This qualitative video study explores how two elementary school teachers taught for conceptual understanding throughout different phases of science inquiry. The teachers implemented teaching materials with a focus on learning science key concepts through the development of word knowledge. A framework for word knowledge was applied to examine the students' level of word knowledge manifested in their talk. In this framework, highly developed knowledge of a word is conceptual knowledge. This includes understanding how the word is situated within a network of other words and ideas. The results suggest that students' level of word knowledge develops toward conceptual knowledge when the students are required to apply the key concepts in their talk throughout all phases of inquiry. When the students become familiar with the key concepts through the initial inquiry activities, the students use the concepts as tools for furthering their conceptual understanding when they discuss their ideas and findings.

New Roles for Text and New Demands on Students in Integrated Science-Literacy Instruction;SCIENCE EDUCATION;;;;;;;;;;;;We report on research that explores students' literacy practices in six Norwegian primary school science classrooms during integrated science-literacy instruction. The study combines observational video data and interview data to examine students' encounters with and use of text, along with their views and experiences related to science and science text. Drawing on New Literacy Studies perspectivesseeing literacy as a situated social practiceour analysis reveals how multiple literacies emerged in the context of integrated science-literacy instruction, where elements of students' informal literacies became valued resources in the dialogic process of inquiry. More specifically, the students engaged in literacy practices that transcended the contexts of science and school science to incorporate texts and literacy practices from the students' everyday lives as well as practices that were confined to a school-only context. On the basis of their talk about text in the classroom and data from focus group interviews, we also identify some of the challenges that these students faced in their encounters with science texts in this setting.;;;;;Blikstad-Balas, Marte/A-6031-2014;Blikstad-Balas, Marte/0000-0002-5029-6837;;;;;;;;;;;;;0036-8326;1098-237X;;;;JAN;2015;99;1;;;;;39;69;;10.1002/sce.21143;http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/sce.21143;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000346585500002;View Full Record in Web of Science

Findings suggest that video-based observations impacted the content and extent of teacher candidate reflection during post-observation discussions, enabling candidates to comment at greater length about their teaching, initiate topics, and cite evidence through reference to the video data.

Emotions are recognized as central to learning yet little is known about the way in which they are produced in naturalistic settings, how emotions relate to classroom learning during interactions, and what antecedent factors are associated with emotional experiences during instruction. Data sources for the study include emotion diaries, student written artifacts, video recordings of class interactions, and interviews. Emotions produced in the moment during classroom interactions are analyzed from video data and audio data through a novel theoretical framework related to the sociology of human emotions. These direct observations are compared with students' recollected emotional experiences reported through emotion diaries and interviews. The study establishes links between pride and triumph within classroom interactions and instructional tasks during learning episodes in a naturalistic setting. We discuss particular classroom activities that are associated with justified feelings of pride and triumph. More specifically, classroom events associated with these emotions were related to understanding science concepts, social interactions, and achieving success on challenging tasks.;;;;;Bellocchi, Alberto/E-2350-2012;"Bellocchi, Alberto/0000-0003-4353-1517; Ritchie, Stephen/0000-0002-2371-1986";;;;;;;;;;;;;0036-8326;1098-237X;;;;JUL;2015;99;4;;;;;638;668;;10.1002/sce.21159;http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/sce.21159;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000356365400002;View Full Record in Web of Science

In addition to arguing why literacy is best studied in context, we provide empirical examples of how small, head-mounted video cameras have been used in two different research projects that share a common aim: understanding the complex ways in which literacy is a part of school practices. The complexity of literacy practices taking place in classrooms, where students draw on a number of texts for a variety of purposes and different literacy discourses co-exist in the same setting, poses a serious challenge for those who wish to study literacy in educational settings. The methodology presented in this article is our attempt to meet this challenge. Our approach relies on using video equipment in innovative ways to capture multiple perspectives, involving research participants in the data collection process and the early stages of analysis, and analysing video data with digital coding software. These methods are combined to obtain a more systematic and detailed insight into the contexts in which literacy takes place.;;;;;Blikstad-Balas, Marte/A-6031-2014;Blikstad-Balas, Marte/0000-0002-5029-6837;;;;;;;;;;;;;1741-4350;1741-4369;;;;SEP;2015;49;3;;;;;140;148;;10.1111/lit.12037;http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/lit.12037;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000365399200005;View Full Record in Web of Science

The exploration focuses on the use of a multitouch tabletop, and an accompanying application called Digital Mysteries, as affordances in CSCLE's for making reasoning skill-based thinking visible for L2 learning in Higher Education. Despite the worldwide promotion of teaching thinking in L2 education, it is not always easy for teachers to identify the types of thinking skills being targeted in L2 pedagogical tasks. To the authors' knowledge, little empirical interactional evidence is available to demonstrate critical thinking in L2 learner talk during group work. This paper examines interactions among three groups of Chinese English Language learners at a higher education institution in a CSCLE. Video data were collected of students' thinking-in-action whilst engaging in multimodal interactions in the environment. Results show that new technologies can provide innovative and empirically driven ways in which L2 learners' thinking is externalised and how critical reasoning can be tracked, promoted, evaluated and self regulated. The findings suggest that collaborations in a CSCLE can support the completion of tasks embedding high levels of cognitive complexity by L2 learners with effective use of limited cognitive resources. This leads to a number of recommendations about integrating the teaching of critical thinking skills into the L2 classroom using CSCLE technologies. (C) 2016 The Authors.

The data consist of 31 video episodes of different socio-emotionally challenging situations among children aged 2-5 years, in day-care activities. The data also include stimulated recall interviews conducted with the teachers (N=8). Based on the video episodes, the video data are analysed by exploring co-regulation strategies that the teachers use in challenging situations. Interview data are analysed by comparing teachers' descriptions of co-regulation strategy use to the co-regulation categories formed in the video analysis. The results of this study show that teachers engage in co-regulation during day-care activities. They use various strategies and combine these when they encounter challenges, particularly favouring activity-related strategies instead of emotion-related strategies. Furthermore, the results indicate that the teachers are, to some extent, aware of their co regulative strategy use, but they could benefit from training that would increase their awareness of different strategies that potentially support children's self-regulation in socio-emotionally challenging early childhood contexts.

Eleven first generation immigrant parents and their young children attending a multicultural Canadian preschool participated in shared art-making workshops. Framed by a qualitative arts-based research methodology, data were collected using ethnographic methods. A multimodal interactional analysis of the video data elucidated the participants' rich, complex, embodied modes of communicating with each other. While research on parent-child interactions typically privileges verbal, face-to-face communications in which partners take turns leading and following each other's movements, this analysis revealed two additional interactional 'dances'; mirroring the partner's movements and synchronising movements between partners. This research suggests new possibilities for discerning and including immigrant parents' culturally-influenced ways of interacting with their children in early childhood settings.";;;;;;Massing, Christine/0000-0002-8518-9628;;;;;;;;;;;;;1350-293X;1752-1807;;;;;2016;24;1;;;;;37;50;;10.1080/1350293X.2015.1120518;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1350293X.2015.1120518;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000374901800005;View Full Record in Web of Science

Quality of instruction can thus be assessed by analyzing the quality of tasks used in classroom discourse. This quasi-experimental study analyzed how teachers used tasks in 38 videotaped biology lessons pertaining to the topic 'blood and circulatory system'. Two fundamental characteristics used to analyze tasks include: (1) required cognitive level of processing (e.g. low level information processing: repetiition, summary, define, classify and high level information processing: interpret-analyze data, formulate hypothesis, etc.) and (2) complexity of task content (e.g. if tasks require use of factual, linking or concept level content). Additionally, students' cognitive knowledge structure about the topic ` blood and circulatory system' was measured using student-drawn concept maps (N = 970 students). Finally, linear multilevel models were created with high-level cognitive processing tasks and higher content complexity tasks as class-level predictors and students' prior knowledge, students' interest in biology, and students' interest in biology activities as control covariates. Results showed a positive influence of high-level cognitive processing tasks (beta = 0.07; p<.01) on students' cognitive knowledge structure. However, there was no observed effect of higher content complexity tasks on students' cognitive knowledge structure.

The sample comprised 39 German secondary school teachers whose lessons on the topic neurobiology were videotaped twice. Teachers' instruction was coded with regard to cognitive activation using a rating manual. Multilevel path analysis results showed a positive significant effect of cognitive activation on students' learning and an indirect effect of teachers' PCK on students' learning mediated through cognitive activation. These findings highlight the importance of PCK in preservice biology teachers' education.

Here we present two studies examining the psychometric properties of the BEO-LV: (1) The interrater agreement and interrater reliability in an observation-based study were found to be satisfactory. (2) The interrater agreement and internal validity in a video study were found to be satisfactory for observers with advanced didactic knowledge.

Ideas and materials to teach inquiry abound. Yet, tools for assessing students' achievement in their processes of experimentation are lacking. The present study assumes a basal, non-exclusive process model of inquiry in experimentation that can be considered a consensus from multiple approaches: (1) finding an idea/hypothesis, (2) planning and conducting an experiment, and (3) drawing conclusions from evidence. The study confronted 339 secondary level students with three guided inquiry experimentation tasks on 3 days. Selected working groups were videotaped while experimenting. All the students reported their processes in a structured report form simultaneous to their progress. The generated videos and reports were analysed in a two-stepped way: (1) Experimentation was coded according to the process model into process plots; on basis of these, (2) process-focused performance scores were calculated considering logical coherence and immediacy of the inquiry processes. Correlative analyses show for two of the tasks that the report format yielded comparable performance scores to those generated from video data after students have had opportunity to learn the surveying formats (r(S)>.80). A first suggestion of a process-oriented assessment tool for inquiry in experimentation can be drawn from this study.

J;Reynolds, RB;;;;Reynolds, Rebecca B.;;;Relationships among tasks, collaborative inquiry processes, inquiry resolutions, and knowledge outcomes in adolescents during guided discovery-based game design in school;JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE;;;;;;;;;;;;This research study investigates US middle school students' collaborative information-seeking, sense-making and knowledge-building practices in a guided discovery-based programme of game design learning in which students and their teachers participate in a formal, in-school class daily, for credit and a grade for an entire year. The learning is supported by information affordances including a wiki learning management system (LMS) housing the curriculum, organized design activities, social media features, tutorials and informational assignments. Students engage in a Constructionist blended learning setting in their classroom, and work collaboratively in teams on game design. The study draws on qualitative video data from six team cases using a coding scheme of categories for the concepts of task, collaborative information seeking (CIS) Modality, and inquiry resolution outcomes. The study also considers linkages between processes and learning outcomes. Variation in engagement across the categories among students was charted, and certain patterns emerged. Findings indicate that some categories of task appear related to some categories of students' chosen CIS Modality for solving problems. Further, CIS processes in support of tasks appear related to inquiry incident resolution (resolved/unresolved). For student completion of advanced programming tasks in particular, we observe more frequent uses of the wiki-based LMS resources, and greater levels of challenge in fulfilling tasks. Results support existing work on these theoretical constructs in the information sciences, and lead to questions on how naturalistic emergence of CIS practices result from greater task knowledge, and whether learned CIS practices (as tasks in and of themselves) can yield project task knowledge gains. Findings of the study and the ongoing questions the work invites hold instructional design implications, and show how social constructivist educational contexts involving collaborative and information seeking and knowledge building among youth game designers can contribute to scholarly understanding of these processes more broadly in related project-based work contexts occurring among both youth and adults.;;;;;;Reynolds, Rebecca/0000-0001-7355-0992;;;;;;;;;;;;;0165-5515;1741-6485;;;;FEB;2016;42;1;;;SI;;35;58;;10.1177/0165551515614537;http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0165551515614537;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000368169000004;View Full Record in Web of Science

Complexity is often used as the analytical focus when regarding learning outcomes, i.e. when analyzing written tests or problem-centered interviews. Numerous studies reveal negative correlations between the complexity of a task and the probability of a student solving it. Purpose: Thus far, few detailed investigations explore the importance of complexity in actual classroom lessons. Moreover, the few efforts made so far revealed inconsistencies. Hence, the present study sheds light on the influence the complexity of students' and teachers' class contributions have on students' learning outcomes. Sample: Videos of 10 German 8th grade physics courses covering three consecutive lessons on two topics each (electricity, mechanics) have been analyzed. The sample includes 10 teachers and 290 students. Design and methods: Students' and teachers' verbal contributions were coded manual-based according to the level of complexity. Additionally, pre-post testing of knowledge in electricity and mechanics was applied to assess the students' learning gain. ANOVA analysis was used to characterize the influence of the complexity on the learning gain. Results: Results indicate that the mean level of complexity in classroom contributions explains a large portion of variance in post-test results on class level. Despite this overarching trend, taking classroom activities into account as well reveals even more fine-grained patterns, leading to more specific relations between the complexity in the classroom and students' achievement. Conclusions: In conclusion, we argue for more reflected teaching approaches intended to gradually increase class complexity to foster students' level of competency.;;;;;Bernholt, Sascha/K-1738-2019;"Bernholt, Sascha/0000-0003-4045-3795; Bruckmann, Maja/0000-0003-0724-908X";;;;;;;;;;;;;0263-5143;1470-1138;;;;MAY 3;2016;34;2;;;;;142;163;;10.1080/02635143.2015.1092955;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02635143.2015.1092955;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000373840100002;View Full Record in Web of Science
J;Tang, KS;;;;Tang, Kok-Sing;;;The interplay of representations and patterns of classroom discourse in science teaching sequences;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION;;;;;;;;;;;;The purpose of this study is to examines the relationship between the communicative approach of classroom talk and the modes of representations used by science teachers. Based on video data from two physics classrooms in Singapore, a recurring pattern in the relationship was observed as the teaching sequence of a lesson unfolded. It was found that as the mode of representation shifted from enactive (action based) to iconic (image based) to symbolic (language based), there was a concurrent and coordinated shift in the classroom communicative approach from interactive-dialogic to interactive-authoritative to non-interactive-authoritative. Specifically, the shift from enactive to iconic to symbolic representations occurred mainly within the interactive-dialogic approach while the shift towards the interactive-authoritative and non-interactive-authoritative approaches occurred when symbolic modes of representation were used. This concurrent and coordinated shift has implications on how we conceive the use of representations in conjunction with the co-occurring classroom discourse, both theoretically and pedagogically.;;;;;Tang, Kok-Sing/I-3245-2019;Tang, Kok-Sing/0000-0002-2764-539X;;;;;;;;;;;;;0950-0693;1464-5289;;;;SEP;2016;38;13;;;;;2069;2095;;10.1080/09500693.2016.1218568;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09500693.2016.1218568;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000386620300001;View Full Record in Web of Science

The study focused on interactional moments when the students opposed or questioned the instructional activity, because it was hypothesized that the agency-control contradiction (Rainio, 2008) becomes particularly evident in these moments. The video data were collected in a heterogeneous Finnish third-grade classroom and analyzed with interaction analysis. The results show how promoting student agency is a contradictory endeavor that requires balancing between the aspirations of dialogic teaching and institutional demands. The results showed that the students' criticism and questioning of instructional activity were targeted at the contents, procedures, and purpose of the instructional activity. We found inconsistency in the teacher's responses to the students' opposition according to the type of opposition. Providing space for negotiation created opportunities for achieving student agency. Conversely, the teacher also silenced students' opposition by enforcing his institutional authority or disregarding student opposition, resulting in interactions that suppressed student agency. This study adds to the understanding of what is at stake when students' agency is promoted in classroom interactions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In the context of geology education in Norway, we investigate two cases in which different approaches to teaching rock identification are carried out. Case A involves traditional teaching activities in one class of upper secondary school students, while Case B consists of teaching activities focusing on observation in a class of elementary school students. The study relies on analysis of video data using headcams from classroom activities and fieldwork. A year later, we asked the same students to apply rock identification to samples that were new to them. Results indicate that the teaching approach influenced the students' opportunities for developing an understanding of rock identification. The students in case A identified the samples by applying specific names of rocks and geological terminology, which led to errors and misconnections. Their application of rock identification can be characterized as name-dropping. By contrast, the students in case B identified rocks by noticing the patterns.

J;"Tan, AL; Lee, PPF; Cheah, YH";;;;"Tan, Aik-Ling; Lee, Peter Peng Foo; Cheah, Yin Hong";;;Educating science teachers in the twenty-first century: implications for pre-service teacher education;ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF EDUCATION;;;;;;;;;;;;This study examines the verbal interactions among a group of pre-service teachers as they engaged in scientific discussions in a medicinal chemistry course. These discussions were part of the course that encompassed an explicit instruction of scientific argumentation structures as well as an applied component, whereby the pre-service teachers learned the content of medicinal chemistry through cases developed using the strategy of competing theories. By adopting a case study approach using sociocultural framework of learning, we examined the interactions between the pre-service teachers using video data. We describe 12 possible forms of interactions during discussions - (1) seeking clarification, (2) figuring out loud, (3) sharing information, (4) agreement, (5) asking questions, (6) providing explanations, (7) raising strategic and procedural issues, (8) stating claims, (9) disagreement, (10) sharing perspectives, (11) offering alternatives, and (12) persuasion. The pre-service teachers engaged in figuring out aloud and seeking clarifications frequently, and used persuasion least in their discussions. To clarify their ideas and thoughts, pre-service teachers commonly rebut their counterparts and used warrants to support their own assertions. A similar pattern was also observed when figuring their thoughts out loud. Our findings suggest that pre-service teachers were able to carry out rebuttals in the argumentation process. However, the quality and function of their rebuttals can be improved by deepening their understanding of the subject matter knowledge and the science argumentation structure. Implications are discussed.;;;;;"Tan, Aik Ling/ABC-2145-2020; Tan, Aik Ling/O-9016-2016; Lee, Peter Peng Foo/AAG-9155-2020";"Tan, Aik Ling/0000-0002-4627-4977; Tan, Aik Ling/0000-0002-4627-4977; Lee, Peter Peng Foo/0000-0002-9595-8128";;;;;;;;;;;;;0218-8791;1742-6855;;;;;2017;37;4;;;SI;;453;471;;10.1080/02188791.2017.1386092;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02188791.2017.1386092;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000423275100003;View Full Record in Web of Science

To conduct a prospective evaluation for effectiveness of an error disclosure assessment tool and video recordings to enhance student learning and metacognitive skills while assessing the IPEC competencies. Design. The instruments for assessing performance (planning, communication, process, and team dynamics) in interprofessional error disclosure were developed. Student self-assessment of performance before and after viewing the recordings of their encounters were obtained. Faculty used a similar instrument to conduct real-time assessments. An instrument to assess achievement of the Interprofessional Education Collaborative (IPEC) core competencies was developed. Qualitative data was reviewed to determine student and faculty perceptions of the simulation. Assessment. The interprofessional simulation training involved a total of 233 students (50 dental, 109 nursing and 74 pharmacy). Use of video recordings made a significant difference in student self assessment for communication and process categories of error disclosure. No differences in student self-assessments were noted among the different professions. There were differences among the family member affects for planning and communication for both pre-video and post-video data. There were significant differences between student self-assessment and faculty assessment for all paired comparisons, except communication in student post-video self-assessment. Students' perceptions of achievement of the IPEC core competencies were positive. Conclusion. The use of assessment instruments and video recordings may have enhanced students' metacognitive skills for assessing performance in interprofessional error disclosure. The simulation training was effective in enhancing perceptions on achievement of IPEC core competencies. This enhanced assessment process appeared to enhance learning about the skills needed for interprofessional error disclosure.;;;;;Poirier, Therese/ABC-3619-2020;Pailden, Junvie/0000-0003-0164-5380;;;;;;;;;;;;;0002-9459;1553-6467;;;;;2017;81;3;;;;;;;54;;;;;;;;;;28496274;;;;;WOS:000400707000014;View Full Record in Web of Science

Twenty-four student teachers in six small groups were video-recorded during collaborative tasks in mathematics. Manifestations of SSRL and students' participation were micro-analytically coded. Next, the concurrence between manifestations of SSRL and the fluctuation of participation was examined and illustrative examples were described. The results show that SSRL involved more active participation than task-focused interaction overall and that SSRL often coincided with increases in participation to a higher level than general. The findings suggest that manifestations of SSRL involved activated participation during the moments when interaction was needed to reciprocally resolve situative challenges and to coordinate activities.

J;Bezemer, J;;;;Bezemer, Jeff;;;Visual research in clinical education;MEDICAL EDUCATION;;;;;;;;;;;;"AimThe aim of this paper is to explore what might be gained from collecting and analysing visual data, such as photographs, scans, drawings, video and screen recordings, in clinical educational research. Its focus is on visual research that looks at teaching and learning as it naturally occurs' in the work place, in simulation centres and other sites, and also involves the collection and analysis of visual learning materials circulating in these sites. BackgroundWith the ubiquity of digital recording devices, video data and visual learning materials are now relatively cheap to collect. Compared to other domains of education research visual materials are not widely used in clinical education research. The paper sets out to identify and reflect on the possibilities for visual research using examples from an ethnographic study on surgical and inter-professional learning in the operating theatres of a London hospital. Main contributionThe paper shows how visual research enables recognition, analysis and critical evaluation of (1) the hidden curriculum, such as the meanings implied by embodied, visible actions of clinicians; (2) the ways in which clinical teachers design multimodal learning environments using a range of modes of communication available to them, combining, for instance, gesture and speech; (3) the informal assessment of clinical skills, and the intricate relation between trainee performance and supervisor feedback; (4) the potentialities and limitations of different visual learning materials, such as textbooks and videos, for representing medical knowledge. Discussion and conclusionThe paper concludes with theoretical and methodological reflections on what can be made visible, and therefore available for analysis, explanation and evaluation if visual materials are used for clinical education research, and what remains unaccounted for if written language remains the dominant mode in the research cycle. Opportunities for quantitative analysis and ethical implications are also discussed.";;;;;Bezemer, Jeff/P-7524-2017;Bezemer, Jeff/0000-0002-9086-937X;;;;;;;;;;;;;0308-0110;1365-2923;;;;JAN;2017;51;1;;;;;105;113;;10.1111/medu.13163;http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/medu.13163;;;;;;;;27785819;;;;;WOS:000393764500017;View Full Record in Web of Science

Based on the theory-driven definition of competence levels, these models imply a correlation between the complexity of a question or a problem, its difficulty and the cognitive demands that are required to answer or solve it. The aim of the study was to apply two competence models in order to analyse the complexity of questions that chemistry teachers use to promote learning in class as well as to compare the results of this analysis. Two model-based coding schemes were constructed and evaluated on the basis of interrater reliability before analysing the teacher questions in 40 chemistry lessons. The results show that between 60 and 65 % of the questions refer to low complexity levels. Although there is a considerable correspondence between the results (69.2 %), neither model can be considered as redundant. These findings are discussed with regard to the level and the development of students' skills in science.;;;;;"Tiemann, Ruediger/HMV-5196-2023; Nehring, Andreas/AAX-2781-2020";"Tiemann, Ruediger/0000-0002-9398-8710; Nehring, Andreas/0000-0002-8723-5552";;;;;;;;;;;;;1571-0068;1573-1774;;;;FEB;2017;15;2;;;;;233;250;;10.1007/s10763-015-9683-9;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10763-015-9683-9;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000391393300003;View Full Record in Web of Science

Students in the experimental group engaged in weekly dyadic conversation exchanges with native speakers in the United States via telecommunication tools. The native speaker interlocutors were trained to provide interactional feedback (recasts) when the nonnative speakers' utterances hindered successful understanding (i. e., negotiation for comprehensibility). The students in the comparison group received regular foreign language instruction without any interaction with native speakers. The coded video data showed that the experimental students worked on improving all linguistic domains of language, likely in response to their native speaker interlocutors' interactional feedback (recasts, negotiation) during the treatment. The pretest-posttest data of the students' spontaneous production showed that they made significant gains in the dimensions of comprehensibility, fluency, and lexicogrammar but not in those of accentedness and pronunciation.;;;;;;"Saito, Kazuya/0000-0002-4718-2943; Akiyama, Yuka/0000-0002-2928-8533";;;;;;;;;;;;;0023-8333;1467-9922;;;;MAR;2017;67;1;;;;;43;74;;10.1111/lang.12184;http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/lang.12184;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000397313100002;View Full Record in Web of Science
J;Korkiakangas, T;;;;Korkiakangas, Terhi;;;Mobilising a team for the WHO Surgical Safety Checklist: a qualitative video study;BMJ QUALITY & SAFETY;;;;;;;;;;;;"Background One challenge identified in the Surgical Safety Checklist literature is the inconsistent participation of operating teams in the safety checks. Less is known about how teams move from preparatory activities into a huddle, and how communication underpins this gathering. The objective of this study is to examine the ways of mobilising teams and the level of participation in the safety checks. Methods Team participation in time-out and sign-out was examined from a video corpus of 20 elective surgical operations. Teams included surgeons, nurses and anaesthetists in a UK teaching hospital, scheduled to work in the operations observed. Qualitative video analysis of team participation was adapted from the study of social interaction. Results The key aspects of team mobilisation were the timing of the checklist, the distribution of personnel in the theatre and the instigation practices used. These were interlinked in bringing about the participation outcomes, the number of people huddling up for time-out and sign-out. Timing seemed appropriate when most personnel were present in the theatre suite; poor timing was marked by personnel dispersed through the theatre. Participation could be managed using the instigation practices, which included or excluded participation within teams. The factors hindering full-team participation at time-out and sign-out were the overlapping (eg, anaesthetic and nursing) responsibilities and the use of exclusive instigation practices. Conclusions The implementation of the Surgical Safety Checklist represents a global concern in patient safety research. Yet how teams huddle for the checks has to be acknowledged as an issue in its own right. Appropriate mobilisation practices can help bringing fuller teams together, which has direct relevance to team training.";;;;;;Korkiakangas, Terhi/0000-0002-2499-5044;;;;;;;;;;;;;2044-5415;2044-5423;;;;MAR;2017;26;3;;;;;177;188;;10.1136/bmjqs-2015-004887;http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjqs-2015-004887;;;;;;;;26929442;;;;;WOS:000394494300003;View Full Record in Web of Science

Earlier research has focused on individual learning and not on the captured temporal sequences of regulation in collaborative learning. The data were collected during a two-month math didactics course taken by teacher education students who collaborated in three member groups. Twenty-two hours of video data were collected to follow how sequences of regulated learning events, along with task execution, emerged within the six groups as their collaboration advanced. The data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis and lag sequential analysis. The results showed that the groups engaged mostly in co-regulated planning and monitoring. Temporal analysis showed that collaborative interactions focusing on task execution promoted socially shared planning, indicating that task execution provided grounding for socially shared planning and regulation to occur. The sequential analysis illustrated that metacognitive monitoring played a facilitative role in the progress of task execution. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

J;"Kumpulainen, K; Rajala, A";;;;"Kumpulainen, Kristiina; Rajala, Antti";;;Dialogic teaching and students' discursive identity negotiation in the learning of science;LEARNING AND INSTRUCTION;;;;;;;;;;;;This study sought to understand how dialogic teaching, as enacted in everyday classroom interaction, affords students opportunities for identity negotiation as learners of science. By drawing on sociocultural and sociolinguistic accounts, the study examined how students' discursive identities were managed and recognized in the moment and over time during dialogic teaching and what consequences these negotiations had for their engagement in science learning. The study used video data of classroom interactions collected from an elementary science learning project and placed a specific analytic focus on four students in particular. The results reveal evidence of a rich variety of discursive identities exposed during dialogic teaching, thus demonstrating how the students' identity negotiations were configured according to the social architecture of classroom discourse. Addressing the temporal dimension of dialogic teaching points out critical shifts in the students' discursive identities, of which identification is argued to be pivotal when creating equitable science learning opportunities.

Five sets of video data (>250 h) documenting how learners were instructed to fly aeroplanes, drive cars and ride bicycles in real life traffic were examined to reveal some common features of correction exchanges. Through detailed multimodal analysis of participants' actions, it is shown how instructors systematically elaborate their corrective instructions to include relevant information about the trouble and remedial action a practice we refer to as unpacking corrections. It is proposed that the practice of unpacking the local particulars of corrections (i) provides for the instructional character of the interaction, and (ii) is highly sensitive to the relevant physical and mobile contingencies. These findings contribute to the existing literature on the interactional organisation of correction and mobility, as well as to ongoing work in ethnomethodology and conversation analysis on teaching and learning as members' phenomena.

In teacher education, these concepts have been implemented for years, and prospective teachers are taught accordingly; it is thus assumed that the teaching of novice teachers is in accordance with these new teaching concepts. In the research project ALPHA', the teaching of novice teachers at the beginning and at the end of their first year in the profession and the teaching of experienced teachers with five or more years of teaching experience was videotaped, so that longitudinal and cross-sectional comparisons were possible. The lessons were analysed by applying a coding system on the instruction and by employing a rater inventory in order to understand the structure and quality of the lessons. Overall, the results indicate high levels of whole class teaching with a rather high level of traditional classroom instruction both for the novice and the experienced teachers. However, the proportions vary depending on the location of teacher education. The results provide evidence that the new teaching concepts learned on the teacher education programme are not necessarily implemented in the classroom and provide possible reasons why this might be the case.";;;;;Wyss, Corinne/IWD-5119-2023;Wyss, Corinne/0000-0003-1025-6053;;;;;;;;;;;;;0260-7476;1360-0540;;;;APR;2017;43;2;;;;;191;205;;10.1080/02607476.2017.1286782;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02607476.2017.1286782;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000395130000005;View Full Record in Web of Science

The present study was the first to test the hypothesized mediation model connecting teacher behavior with peer liking and disliking status, via peer perceptions of teacher liking and disliking for the student. We used a longitudinal design and controlled for peer perceptions of student behavior. A sample of 1,420 5th-grade students (M-age = 10.60) from 56 classes completed sociometric questionnaires at 3 time points within 1 school year. At the first time point video data was also recorded, and teacher behavior toward specific students was coded. A multilevel path analysis showed that teachers did function as social referents for peer status but only through their negative behavior toward a student. Negative teacher behavior was associated with peer perceptions of the teacher's disliking for the student 3 months later, which in turn predicted peers' disliking of the student 6 months later. Findings suggest that teachers play a prominent role in peer relationships, particularly in peer disliking. For practice, this suggests that it may be important for teachers to refrain from openly negative behavior toward students, particularly those at risk of peer rejection.;;;;;Hendrickx, Marloes/AAV-5954-2020;Hendrickx, Marloes/0000-0002-1290-3886;;;;;;;;;;;;;0022-0663;1939-2176;;;;MAY;2017;109;4;;;;;546;558;;10.1037/edu0000157;http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/edu0000157;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000400698700007;View Full Record in Web of Science
J;de Sousa, EBC;;;;de Sousa, E. Brook Chapman;;;Promoting the contributions of multilingual preschoolers;LINGUISTICS AND EDUCATION;;;;;;;;;;;;This study analyzed the use of Instructional Conversation (IC) in a multilingual preschool context. It sought to identify scaffolding strategies that promoted the contributions of multilingual children to IC. Twenty-seven hours of video data from seven classrooms were analyzed. Only three sequences emerged in which multilingual children actively contributed to the conversations. Educators in these sequences promoted children's contributions by: (a) using multimodal resources, (b) responding to the actions and words of the children, and (c) focusing on shared meaning-making or intersubjectivity. Translanguaging emerged as an important strategy to encourage the involvement of multilingual children in IC. Results provide invaluable exemplars of effective IC in preschool classrooms with multilingual children. The results demonstrate alternative ways of talking with young multilingual children and indicate a need for a pedagogical focus away from teacher-directed practices to joint activities and responsiveness to children's contributions.

J;Tang, KS;;;;Tang, Kok-Sing;;;Analyzing Teachers' Use of Metadiscourse: The Missing Element in Classroom Discourse Analysis;SCIENCE EDUCATION;;;;;;;;;;;;Metadiscourse, or metatalk, is a discursive resource used in virtually any text or conversation to organize its content or signal the author's stance toward the content. Despite its prevalence in classroom talk, few have examined the role of metadiscourse and how it assists teachers and students to manage classroom communication of scientific knowledge. Thus, the purpose of this study is to analyze how science teachers use metadiscourse to construct scientific knowledge with their students. Based on a corpus of classroom video data, I developed a typology of metadiscourse commonly found in science classroom discourse. The typology comprises six major categories of metadiscourse, namely text connective, knowledge connective, activity connective, attitude marker, epistemology marker, and interpretive marker. In addition, I showed how the analysis on metadiscourse was necessary to complement the gaps from classroom analysis focusing on the interaction and content development aspects of classroom talk, particularly during the opening and reviewing stages of constructing a scientific explanation. With a better understanding of metadiscourse, its potential use as a pedagogical intervention to promote science learning is then discussed.;;;;;Tang, Kok-Sing/I-3245-2019;Tang, Kok-Sing/0000-0002-2764-539X;;;;;;;;;;;;;0036-8326;1098-237X;;;;JUL;2017;101;4;;;;;548;583;;10.1002/sce.21275;http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/sce.21275;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000403292000006;View Full Record in Web of Science

The aim of this study is to explore the differences between high- and low-challenge collaborative learning sessions. This is achieved through examining how the three phases of self-regulated learning occur in a collaborative setting and the types of interaction associated with these phases. The participants were teacher training students (N = 44), who worked in groups on a complex task related to didactics of mathematics during 6 weeks. The participants were instructed to use an application that was designed to increase awareness of the cognitive, motivational and emotional challenges the group might face. Based on the application's log files, the sessions were categorized into low- and high-challenge sessions. The video data from each session were coded based on the self-regulation phases and the types of interaction. The frequencies of the phases and the types of interaction were calculated for each session, and process discovery methods were applied using the heuristic miner algorithm. The results show no significant differences between the sessions in the frequency of phases. However, the process models of the two sessions were different: in the high-challenge sessions, the groups switched between the forethought and performance phases more. In conclusion, the regulation phases and types of interaction that contribute to successful collaboration differ in high- and low challenge sessions and support for regulated learning is needed especially at the middle of the learning process.;;;;;Järvelä, Sanna M/B-4267-2013;Sobocinski, Marta/0000-0001-9591-9113;;;;;;;;;;;;;1556-1623;1556-1631;;;;AUG;2017;12;2;;;;;275;294;;10.1007/s11409-016-9167-5;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11409-016-9167-5;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000404678600005;View Full Record in Web of Science

The analyses are taken from the DFG-project NaSch1 (Narrative writing skills in grade 1). NaSch1 examines task settings in the school subject 'German' based on an observational system consisting of 25 subject specific and universal didactical criteria using 43 videos. Against a backdrop of didactic conceptions, it is shown to what extent the two dimensions 'social interaction' and 'target orientation' can be theoretically described and empirically tested. The descriptive results indicate that writing lessons largely fulfil universal didactical quality criteria (e.g. precision). With respect to subject specific didactical criteria (e.g. integration of the student's experience realm) writing lessons show a lower quality.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0044-3247;;;;;SEP-OCT;2017;63;5;;;;;636;656;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000412791700007;View Full Record in Web of Science

In the project, we developed a Learning Progression Framework (LPF) for matter and energy in social ecological systems; the LPF contains four achievement levels. Based on the LPF, we designed a Plant Unit to help Levels 2 and 3 students advance to Level 4 of the LPF. In the present study, 12 teachers used the Plant Unit to teach, and their students took an LPF-based assessment both before and after the teaching intervention. We observed and videotaped 20 lessons from four of those participating teachers. In this article, we report on how teachers' teaching practice and students' learning practice in classrooms mediate the intervention's impact on students' learning outcomes. Regarding teaching practice, we focused on how teachers used discourse strategies to engage students in meaningful learning. Regarding students' learning practice, we studied epistemological frames that the students used to guide their thinking. The results show that encouraging students to talk about the how and why behind their answers did not always lead to students' use of productive frames and positive learning gains. We found that one teacher, Ms. S, successfully fostered students' use of productive frames by using discourse strategies that target the specialized ways of reasoning behind the science content and the rationale for scientific investigations. Ms. S' students also achieved a learning gain higher than the average learning gain in the intervention. These results suggest that discourse strategies aligned with the LPF play an important role in learning progression based interventions.

The effects of cognitive skills, goal orientations and the characteristics of learning partners - an analysis based on video data;ZEITSCHRIFT FUR ERZIEHUNGSWISSENSCHAFT;;;;;;;;;;;;The effective use of learning time is considered one of the most important predictors of successful and good teaching. In the present study we investigated how cognitive skills and goal orientation influenced the effective use of learning time during the open phases of game-based learning We used a newly developed method for video- and audio analysis (German: MuVA), which allowed for reliable documentation of students' interactions during those phases. The two-step multiple regression model demonstrated that both the learner's and the learning partner's goal orientation explain significant parts of the variance: A high performance goal orientation impairs a student's effective use of learning time, while a high performance avoidance orientation has a positive impact on his or her effective use of learning time. Working with a partner who has a high learning goal orientation or a high work avoidance orientation increases a student's effective use of his or her learning time, while a high work avoidance orientation on the partner's side has the opposite effect. Cognitive skills did not influence the effective use of learning time.;;;;;"Boom, Kay-Dennis KD/R-5200-2018; Scholkmann, Antonia Beatrice/AAX-2489-2020";"Boom, Kay-Dennis KD/0000-0001-5629-5141; Scholkmann, Antonia Beatrice/0000-0002-6378-4426; Knigge, Michel/0000-0002-0192-8340";;;;;;;;;;;;;1434-663X;1862-5215;;;;DEC;2017;20;4;;;;;651;669;;10.1007/s11618-017-0736-4;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11618-017-0736-4;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000416262100006;View Full Record in Web of Science

This mixed-methods study investigated how interactive dynamic and static visualizations embedded in web-based inquiry instruction can support ELs and non-ELs in developing a coherent understanding of energy and matter transformations in life science. A total of 331 seventh-grade ELs and non-ELs were randomly assigned to a dynamic or a static visualization condition. During inquiry instruction, students in the dynamic group explored interactive dynamic visualizations of energy and matter transformations; students in the static group explored static, yet otherwise equivalent, interactive visualizations. The results show that, while both forms of visualizations were beneficial for students, dynamic visualizations had significant advantages for improving all students' understanding of the target concepts. Our analyses of video data revealed that ELs and non-ELs in the dynamic condition engaged in more talk turns to interpret the scientific phenomena using both visual and textual representations, whereas ELs and non-ELs in the static condition appeared to rely on textual information to obtain new ideas about the scientific phenomena from the visualization. Compared to the static group, students in the dynamic group also more successfully evaluated and consolidated a range of ideas to develop coherent scientific explanations using evidence from the visualization. This study provides evidence that interactive dynamic visualizations have promise for supporting science learning for all students, including ELs who are often underserved in mainstream science classrooms.

Design/methodology/approach The authors draw on two years' worth of observation, interview, survey and digital video data to present a case study of Javier (all names are pseudonyms), a Latinx English Learner with several learning disabilities. The authors worked with him, making digital videos in a general education classroom as part of a larger design-based study. The authors describe how he made meaning in various modes, across modes, and how his intersectional identities inflected his meaning-making and were visible in his video artifacts. Findings Javier was an able digital composer, made meaning across modes and was attentive to audience. His videos offer a portrait of a child with learning disabilities navigating his complex cultural worlds. Research limitations/implications This is a single case study built to bridge multiple theoretical and disciplinary backgrounds.

J;Alexander, R;;;;Alexander, Robin;;;Developing dialogic teaching: genesis, process, trial;RESEARCH PAPERS IN EDUCATION;;;;;;;;;;;;"This paper considers the development and randomised control trial (RCT) of a dialogic teaching intervention designed to maximise the power of classroom talk to enhance students' engagement and learning. Building on the author's earlier work, the intervention's pedagogical strand instantiates dialogic teaching not as a single, circumscribed method' but as an interlocking set of permissive repertoires through which, steered by principles of procedure, teachers energise their own and their students' talk. The repertoires are directed both to teaching's improvement and to its larger epistemological, cultural and civic purposes. Its professional strand entailed teacher induction and training followed by a cyclic programme of planning, target-setting and review using mentoring and video/audio analysis. Supported by the UK Education Endowment Foundation it was piloted in London and trialled in three other UK cities with combined intervention/control cohorts of nearly 5000year 5 (4th grade) students and 208 teachers. The independent evaluation calculated that after 20weeks students in the intervention group were two months ahead of their control group peers in English, mathematics and science tests; while coded video data showed that the changes in both teacher and student talk were striking and in the direction intended. The RCT methodology affords limited explanatory purchase but insights are available from other studies. These, together with contingent questions and future possibilities, are discussed in the paper's conclusion.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0267-1522;1470-1146;;;;;2018;33;5;;;;;561;598;;10.1080/02671522.2018.1481140;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02671522.2018.1481140;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000447418200001;View Full Record in Web of Science
J;Rosario-Ramos, EM;;;;Rosario-Ramos, Enid Marie;;;Why aren't there enough of our stories to read?: Teaching autoethnographies for radical healing;ENGLISH TEACHING-PRACTICE AND CRITIQUE;;;;;;;;;;;;"Purpose This paper aims to draw on the analysis of instruction and student work in an English Language Arts classroom to discuss how teachers may support dispossessed students' journeys toward radical healing (Ginwright, 2010) by using critically caring pedagogies - pedagogies grounded in teachers' deep understanding of the systemic inequalities faced by their students and a strong commitment to contributing to social justice. Radical healing involves naming and redefining individual experiences of oppression as collective struggle to express desire and hope (Winn, 2012; 2013; Tuck, 2009). Design/methodology/approach The data used for this paper included video data from a two-week writing unit and fieldnotes from preceding lessons, classroom documents and handouts and final work from students. Data were analyzed through a process of open and focused coding (Coffey and Atkinson 1996; Miles and Huberman, 1994). Findings Three major practices emerged from the analysis of instruction: affirming student experience, connecting individual and community struggles and using writing as a space for expressing desire and hope. Student work showed how students used their writing to engage in the kind of analysis that autoethnographies encourage - reflection on individual lives as collective experiences and the expression of hope - which the author aligns with the goals of radical healing. Students wrote about enduring difficult life circumstances. They also found connections between their experiences and the lives of their peers and communities. Finally, they used their writing to express desire and hope. Originality/value The teacher's pedagogy provides an illustration of teaching critically caring literacies (Camangian, 2010) that may lead to radical healing (Ginwright, 2010) - a pedagogy that seeks justice and encourages resilience, particularly for youth who have experienced great injustices. This kind of pedagogy requires not only the willingness to feel critical hope (Duncan-Andrade, 2009) with students but also a commitment to challenging disciplinary canons by allowing students' lives to enter the classroom. In her classroom, the teacher created a space for her students to reflect on their lives and experience radical healing by encouraging them to contextualize their experiences within socio-historical processes and social, economic and political structures that were designed to create and sustain inequity. The autoethnography unit provided an opportunity for students to evaluate their own histories, come to terms with the past and begin to express desire and imagine hopeful futures (Tuck, 2009; Winn, 2012; 2013).";;;;;;Rosario-Ramos, Enid M/0000-0001-9723-3262;;;;;;;;;;;;;1175-8708;;;;;;2018;17;3;;;;;213;227;;10.1108/ETPC-04-2017-0048;http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/ETPC-04-2017-0048;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000443242000006;View Full Record in Web of Science

Opportunities and difficulties;LANGUAGE AND EDUCATION;;;;;;;;;;;;This article explores how opportunities and limitations in creating intercontextualtiy between everyday and scientific ideas emerge in teacher-student interactions, with a particular focus on the teacher's role. The article draws on data from an empirical, longitudinal, study in a lower secondary school in Norway to analyze student-teacher interactions in regular lessons. The analysis is based on sociocultural and dialogical approaches to meaning-making and learning, in which video data is subjected to interaction analysis. Our main findings illustrate that creating intercontextuality in students' learning trajectories, by building on everyday knowledge and experiences as resources for classroom interactions, remains a complex task. In the classrooms we have followed, the findings show that the teacher's narratives of how to frame learning activities and position the students in meaning-making process are grounded in teachers' norms and assumptions of what constitutes appropriate resources to engage students' in the dialogic creation of intercontextuality. These findings have implications for how teachers frame learning activities where students get opportunities to build upon relevant resources for discussing ideas brought to life in complex social interactions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0950-0782;1747-7581;;;;;2018;32;1;;;;;43;59;;10.1080/09500782.2017.1367799;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09500782.2017.1367799;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000427734800003;View Full Record in Web of Science

This is explored in the article, using the concepts of activity frames and stancetaking, focusing on the social organization of the game design activity. Building on video data from one 6th grade class and one 7th grade class designing computer games based on their social studies curriculum, this article shows that tensions arise when students fail to agree on what the activity they are doing is really about: The academic content and what students commonly perceive as school activities, or a game design activity informed by their leisure time.

We assume that teachers who are aware of the student perspective use reappraisal more often than teachers who are not aware of the student perspective. In order to test this hypothesis, we presented several video cases that illustrated a problematic classroom situation to pre service teachers in an experimental design. In addition, we presented supplementary information to the experimental group, in which the student who caused the disruption, reflected on his/her behavior by commenting on the teaching situation. In contrast, the video solely depicting the disruption was shown in the control group. Following a thorough stimulus evaluation check (both groups showed comparable emotional evaluation of the video cases), it could be demonstrated that the experimental group used significantly more reappraisal than the control group (eta(2) = 0.13), while suppression seemed not to be influenced by the student perspective it was equally often used in both groups.

It is of paramount importance to ensure that students have a relevant repertoire of practices they can employ when facing scientific content inside and outside the school context. The present study reports on students in seventh grade acting as researchers. Over an 8-week collaborative research period, students posed their own research question, attempted to answer it by systematically testing hypotheses, discussing findings, presenting their conclusions, and documenting their process in a written report. Drawing on the perspectives of New Literacy Studieswhich sees literacy as socially situatedwe analyze the purpose of all the 21 participating students' texts (n=344). Video observations and interviews with students are used to contextualize the writing events. We find that the students chose to write multiple kinds of texts for a variety of purposes. Analyzing purpose and the context, three stages of socialization into scientific writing is revealed, ranging from what the students write on their own initiative, via texts written through challenges to demanding research tasks scaffolded through writing instructions given by the teacher. Further, the students emphasized the relevance of both the research experience and the writing to their future adult life.;;;;;Blikstad-Balas, Marte/A-6031-2014;Blikstad-Balas, Marte/0000-0002-5029-6837;;;;;;;;;;;;;0036-8326;1098-237X;;;;MAR;2018;102;2;;;;;304;341;;10.1002/sce.21324;http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/sce.21324;;;;;;;;29540938;;;;;WOS:000424849100005;View Full Record in Web of Science

We have investigated scaffolding by analysing teacher-student-interactions and developed an instrument to code student level of attainment and teacher strength of intervention as the relevant student and teacher variables. For the construction of interaction patterns the coded variables were related to each other. In order to assess the resulting interaction patterns for scaffolding quality, we devised rules based on the contingent shift principle. The analyses show that our methodology is reliable and valid, and that it is effective for discerning contingent from non-contingent interaction patterns. Furthermore, our fine-grained methodology allows us to identify and locate crucial points in the teacher's supporting behaviour that make for contingent or non-contingent scaffolding. Implications for the assessment of instructional quality as well as for teacher education and professionalism are discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This teaching intervention was designed with the use of inquiry-based learning principles for teachers, such as the empirical cycle and the posing of thought-provoking questions. The intervention was put into practice in 10 upper-grade classrooms. The trajectory comprised four lessons, complemented with two premeasures and two postmeasures. The control condition consisted of 11 upper-grade teachers and their students. The success of the intervention was tested using an established standardized achievement test and situated measures. In this way, by means of premeasure and postmeasure questionnaires and video data, an assessment could be made of the change in students' scientific knowledge before, during, and after the intervention. In this study, we primarily focused on the dynamics of students' real-time expressions of scientific knowledge in the classroom. Important indicators of the effect of the intervention were found. Through focusing on the number of explanations and predictions, a significant increase could be seen in the proportion of students' utterances displaying scientific understanding in the intervention condition. In addition, students in the intervention condition more often reasoned on higher complexity levels than students in the control condition. No effect was found for students' scientific knowledge as measured with a standardized achievement test. Implications for future studies are stressed, as well as the importance of enriching the evaluation of intervention studies by focusing on dynamics in the classroom.;;;;;;Steenbeek, Henderien/0000-0001-6750-2142;;;;;;;;;;;;;0157-244X;1573-1898;;;;APR;2018;48;2;;;;;301;324;;10.1007/s11165-016-9569-z;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11165-016-9569-z;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000429121400003;View Full Record in Web of Science

In order to explore this, we studied the ways in which a teacher professional development programme (Dialogic Video Cycle; Groschner et al. 2015) might affect the quality of teachers' instructional and motivational discourse. The programme provided video-based professional development on productive classroom discourse for an entire school year. During the same period of time, we explored changes in students' perceptions of autonomy and competence support and possible implications for students' intrinsic learning motivation. The study followed a two-group field-experiment design; 10 STEM classes participated (N = 226 students). The intervention group (IG) was compared to a control group (CG), which participated in traditional professional development on classroom discourse (IG: n (Students) = 136, n (Teachers) = 6; CG: n (Students) = 90, n (Teachers) = 4). The results show significant group differences in the development of instructional and motivational discourse throughout the school year, resulting in significant benefits for the IG. Furthermore, the students experienced their teachers as more autonomy- and competence-supportive throughout the year, leading to increased experiences of self-determination and intrinsic learning motivation. The results are discussed in the light of recent research and theory.";;;;;"Kiemer, Katharina/O-3644-2019; Seidel, Tina/C-6221-2009";"Kiemer, Katharina/0000-0003-0130-8210; Seidel, Tina/0000-0002-2578-1208; Groschner, Alexander/0000-0001-7286-7445";;;;;;;;;;;;;0256-2928;1878-5174;;;;APR;2018;33;2;;;;;377;402;;10.1007/s10212-016-0324-7;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10212-016-0324-7;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000426652700011;View Full Record in Web of Science
J;Silseth, K;;;;Silseth, Kenneth;;;Students' everyday knowledge and experiences as resources in educational dialogues;INSTRUCTIONAL SCIENCE;;;;;;;;;;;;In this article, I analyze teachers' use of students' everyday knowledge and experiences as resources for learning in educational dialogues. By analyzing video data of teachers' attempts to contextualize instruction in naturalistic settings in a lower secondary school, I examine how teachers use such resources to support and guide student learning. By employing a situated approach to learning, I provide a turn-by-turn analysis of how teachers use students' everyday knowledge as resources to socially construct knowledge when working with academic subject matter. The concepts of intercontextuality and positioning function as analytical tools that enable an analysis of the relationships between the use of everyday experiences and the social organization of participation during teachers' instructional work. The findings show that attempts at contextualizing instruction were identified in many of the lessons. The findings also document that teachers face both challenges and opportunities when contextualizing instruction. A turn-by-turn analysis shows that the function of everyday experiences in educational dialogues depends on how such resources are mobilized, how they are brought into the conversations, as well as the roles assigned to students in the dialogues. In the article, issues contributing to the productive use of everyday resources in educational dialogues are displayed and discussed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0020-4277;1573-1952;;;;APR;2018;46;2;;;;;291;313;;10.1007/s11251-017-9429-x;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11251-017-9429-x;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000426722200005;View Full Record in Web of Science

J;"Silseth, K; Erstad, O";;;;"Silseth, Kenneth; Erstad, Ola";;;Connecting to the outside: Cultural resources teachers use when contextualizing instruction;LEARNING CULTURE AND SOCIAL INTERACTION;;;;;;;;;;;;The aim of this article is to examine what resources teachers mobilize when contextualizing instruction. In this instructional method, teachers use students' everyday experiences as tools for teaching subject matter at school. Research has documented that contextualizing instruction can support classroom learning. However, we do not know very much about what types of resources teachers view as relevant in this kind of instructional work. In this article, we analyze video data of student-teacher interactions in 43 lessons, which were collected when following four lower secondary teachers over one academic year. The analysis is based on a sociocultural perspective of learning and teaching in which the focus of analysis is on what kind of everyday experiences teachers orient to when supporting students' participation. The findings show that the resources teachers orient to can be grouped into five categories: (1) teachers orienting to characteristics of the local community, (2) teachers orienting to examples from everyday practices, (3) teachers orienting to personal issues, (4) teachers orienting to concrete objects, and (5) teachers orienting to knowledge from travelling abroad. These categories show variation and multiplicity of resources that teachers use when contextualizing instruction, and the implications of this multiplicity are discussed in the article.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2210-6561;;;;;JUN;2018;17;;;;;;56;68;;10.1016/j.lcsi.2017.12.002;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lcsi.2017.12.002;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000435621100004;View Full Record in Web of Science

These studies aim to rigorously assess knowledge in nurses, midwives, and doctors in these skills, tested before and after watching short videos demonstrating these skills. Practitioners were attending BFHI education, and the video study was additional. In Phase 1 clinicians in England were randomised to one of two videos (practitioner role play or clinical demonstration). The results showed improvements in knowledge and confidence, and a preference for clinical demonstration by mothers and infants. The clinical demonstration video was evaluated in China in Phase 2 where expert trainers viewed the video after completing the BHFI workshop, and in Phase 3 practitioners viewed the video before the BHFI workshop. Phase 2 with expert trainers only showed improvement in knowledge of hand expression but not positioning and attachment. In Phase 3 clinicians showed improved knowledge for both skills. In all Phases there were statistically significant improvements in confidence in practice in both skills. Viewing short videos increased knowledge, particularly about teaching hand expression, and confidence in both skills.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1471-5953;;;;;JUL;2018;31;;;;;;7;13;;10.1016/j.nepr.2018.04.005;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nepr.2018.04.005;;;;;;;;29727794;;;;;WOS:000442332500002;View Full Record in Web of Science
J;"Reynolds, D; Daniel, S";;;;"Reynolds, Dan; Daniel, Shannon";;;Toward Contingency in ScaffoldingReading Comprehension: Next Steps for Research;READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY;;;;;;;;;;;;Although much research exists on scaffolding in reading instruction, confusion about the construct persists. In this commentary inspired by a recent article in Reading Research Quarterly, we argue for the importance of contingencythat is, responsiveness to student thinkingin reading comprehension scaffolding. We begin by defining two sometimes nebulous constructs: scaffolding and comprehension. We then argue that the dynamic, contextual, and affective nature of comprehension calls for a focus on contingency in scaffolding interactions because the requisite assumptions of preplanned scaffolding can obscure students' emergent comprehension. To focus on contingency, three implications for research follow. First, research designs could separate interactional scaffolding from planned scaffolding so as to directly investigate the construct. Second, collaboratively analyzing video data of scaffolding interactions is an effective tool for teacher educators and researchers. Finally, researchers should consider refining, building on, or comparing their findings with existing frameworks to illuminate both the transferable and the idiosyncratic dimensions of contingent scaffolding. This could also include studying students' discursive moves in addition to teachers' utterances, which might offer a new lens on how teachers adjust scaffolds in moment-to-moment interactions. These implications lay a foundation for a research agenda that goes beyond assumptions about students built into planned scaffolding and tackles the challenges of contingent comprehension scaffolding.;;;;;Reynolds, Dan/AAO-5757-2020;Reynolds, Dan/0000-0002-8403-2856;;;;;;;;;;;;;0034-0553;1936-2722;;;;JUL-SEP;2018;53;3;;;;;367;373;;10.1002/rrq.200;http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rrq.200;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000436408300006;View Full Record in Web of Science

This study examined their effects on students' situational interest in videotaped biology instruction from German sixth-grade classes. Additionally, we evaluated the mediating effects of cognitive activation on classroom management and supportive climate using multilevel analyses. Each of the 28 biology classes in our sample had three lessons videotaped while the topic botany was being taught. The three basic dimensions of instructional quality were separately examined using respective rating manuals. Multilevel analyses showed positive total effects of all the three dimensions on students' situational interest. The results also revealed empirical evidence that cognitive activation mediated both the effects of classroom management and supportive climate on students' situational interest. As our findings indicate subject-specific characteristics are necessary to foster students' situational interest, we suggest further studies for deeper examination and analysis of these characteristics.;;;;;Neuhaus, Birgit J./K-1272-2014;"Neuhaus, Birgit J./0000-0001-6031-9660; Fortsch, Christian/0000-0002-3625-6791";;;;;;;;;;;;;0959-4752;1873-3263;;;;AUG;2018;56;;;;;;42;53;;10.1016/j.learninstruc.2018.03.001;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.learninstruc.2018.03.001;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000434752100005;View Full Record in Web of Science
J;Takahashi, J;;;;Takahashi, Junko;;;Practices of self-selection in the graduate classroom: Extension, redirection, and disjunction;LINGUISTICS AND EDUCATION;;;;;;;;;;;;"This study investigates the practices of student self-selection in the graduate-level American classroom. Self-selection is a crucial part of the learning process because it allows for the exchange of students' and teachers' views, analyses, and opinions, making these exchanges into a whole-classroom experience. Active students who make oral contributions in class are believed to learn more than those who do not (Weaver & Qi, 2005) and to enhance their critical thinking (Crone, 1997; Garside, 1996). In the graduate classroom, however, student self-selection may be challenging, as the material students tackle tends to be highly technical. Given the importance of student self-selection in this academically demanding context, more analytical attention must be devoted to uncovering the nature of participation. With 20 h of video data collected from graduate classes and analyzed through the lens of conversation analysis (CA), this study identifies three main practices employed by self-selecting speakers: extension by piling, contribution with hand-raising, and participation prefacing. Each occurs with different degrees of 'fittedness' to prior talk, in part evidenced in the different levels of mitigation use by the self-selectors. The findings of this study contribute to the small body of classroom discourse studies in the graduate classroom and provide a first step towards understanding how self-selections may be strategically managed or promoted.

Professional learning opportunities can support this; these may be most effective when situated in the teachers' own working practices. This article describes a project to support Computing teachers in developing pedagogical skills by carrying out classroom-based research in their schools. A group of 22 primary (Grades K-5) and secondary (Grades 6-10) teachers from schools across England planned, designed, and implemented research projects either individually or in small groups, supported by a team of university colleagues. Inter and intra group progress was shared online and face-to-face within a distributed community of inquiry. Data collection included surveys, video data, and the projects completed by the teachers. The findings from the project are analysed using Clarke and Hollingsworth's Interconnected Model of Teacher Professional Growth (IMTPG), which enables an identification and exploration of teacher change. Results of the analysis demonstrate that the approach can foster growth networks-the construct used within IMTPG to indicate teacher change which is likely to be sustained and fundamental to teachers' understanding. The individual nature of this change indicates that the approach supports personal change related to each teacher's specific situation. Although there is a huge literature on action research as part of teacher professional learning, we believe this to be the first time this has been carried out in the context of computer science education. We conclude by critically reflecting on the lessons that we have learned in leading this project.";;;;;"Csizmadia, Andrew/AAW-5108-2021; Sentance, Sue/HFZ-9227-2022; Sentance, Sue/ABI-6702-2020";"Csizmadia, Andrew/0000-0001-8546-1225; Sentance, Sue/0000-0002-0259-7408";;;;;;;;;;;;;1946-6226;;;;;SEP;2018;18;3;;;;;;;14;10.1145/3171129;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3171129;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000455984600004;View Full Record in Web of Science

Each teacher was videotaped for one lesson on the unit blood and circulatory system. Before the teaching unit, students' prior knowledge was tested with a pretest. After the teaching unit, students' content knowledge was tested with a posttest. The aim of the knowledge tests here was for the better selection of the four samples for qualitative comparison in the two countries. The quantitative analysis showed that more lower-order teacher questions and more real life instances that were introduced after learning relevant concepts were in Chinese lessons than in German lessons. There were no significant differences in the frequency of higher-order questions or real life instances that were introduced before learning concepts. Qualitative analysis showed that both German teachers guided students to analyze the reasoning process of Landsteiner experiment, but nor Chinese teachers did that. The findings reflected the subtle influence of culture on classroom teaching. Relatively, Chinese biology teachers focused more on learning content and the application of the content in real life; German biology teachers emphasized more on invoking students' reasoning and divergent thinking.";;;;;;Neuhaus, Birgit/0000-0001-6031-9660;;;;;;;;;;;;;1871-1502;1871-1510;;;;SEP;2018;13;3;;;;;671;686;;10.1007/s11422-016-9797-6;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11422-016-9797-6;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000444575000004;View Full Record in Web of Science

Students who participate in developing, validating, deploying, and refining models are engaged in authentic scientific practices. Modelling instruction (MI) was developed to promote the role of models and modelling in introductory university physics classes. MI for university physics is founded on the basis of two theoretical foundations, modelling theory of science and modelling theory of instruction. We claim that the translation of these theories into classroom practice supports learning in science. We substantiate this claim by first describing how these theories establish complementary cycles of content development and student participation. Then we provide evidence of these interacting cycles by analysing the development of a conceptual model in a MI university physics class using video data. The video data we present includes students developing a scientific conceptual model first in a small student group and a later in the full class. We argue that the integration of the theoretical components underlying MI are key supports in providing the opportunity for students to develop conceptual models and engage in the practice of doing physics.;;;;;Sawtelle, Vashti/F-7286-2016;"Sawtelle, Vashti/0000-0003-2355-8587; Brewe, Eric/0000-0003-3480-7040";;;;;;;;;;;;;0143-0807;1361-6404;;;;SEP;2018;39;5;;;;;;;54001;10.1088/1361-6404/aac236;http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1361-6404/aac236;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000435571800001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Our analysis of videotaped biology lessons and student achievement showed varying frequencies in using these activities and their effects on achievement. Those students taught with more epistemic activities had higher achievement. We believe that the SRA framework can be a worthwhile methodical tool for teaching biology to foster student learning.

Focus questions are content-related anchoring questions highlighting the key content taught in individual lessons (Forbes & Davis, 2010). In Wadouh' study, students answered a knowledge test before and after the lesson on blood and the circulatory system and one lesson per teacher was videotaped to investigate teaching practices in grade 9 biology classrooms. Students also completed a post-unit concept mapping exercise and a motivation-interest questionnaire. In this study, 30 lesson videos selected from 47 were re-analyzed for teachers' use of focus questionsno focus questions, non-specific or simple focus questions, and specific and challenging focus questions. Individual students' scores in the concept mapping exercise were aggregated as students' topic-related knowledge structure. Multilevel analyses revealed a significant positive effect of teachers' use of specific and challenging focus questions on students' topic-related knowledge structure. Furthermore, a comparative case analysis of the classroom teaching-learning process was conducted in four lessons where teachers used specific and challenging focus questions in two of the lessons and non-specific or simple focus questions in the other two lessons. The findings indicate that specific and challenging focus questions anchored lessons on students' co-construction of scientific explanations by activating their pre-instructional ideas, whereas non-specific or simple focus questions anchored lessons on their accumulation of canonical scientific knowledge.

This study investigated whether teacher judgment accuracy in interplay with student characteristics was predictive for verbal teacher-student interactions. A video study of N-S = 348 students in N-C = 18 mathematics classrooms was conducted. Multilevel analyses showed that student self-concept was predictive of verbal teacher-student interactions. In addition, adaptive teacher questions were observed for students with lower pre-achievement. Conclusions with regard to adaptive functions of teacher judgment accuracy in the process of teaching are drawn. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

This article looks at how students organize the use of different artifacts when creating computer games about historical topics. The data informing this article consist of video data collected from one sixth-grade class and one seventh-grade class in Norway. A sociocultural perspective is used to show how the students use a combination of different artifacts as resources in the game design process, focusing on how students take epistemic stances and how the artifacts are given different epistemic status. The students jointly construct knowledge that they then integrate into computer games using artifacts such as textbooks, world maps, Google, and timelines. The article shows how designing games about historical topics is a complex process in which students use artifacts as the basis for knowledge claims and storytelling, and students need to negotiate and balance their own design preferences with historical accuracy and the expectations of the classroom setting.;;;;;Øygardslia, Kristine/ABF-4728-2020;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2210-6561;2210-657X;;;;DEC;2018;19;;;;;;61;73;;10.1016/j.lcsi.2018.04.013;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lcsi.2018.04.013;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000453500400007;View Full Record in Web of Science

Academic concepts can be any kind of concept, such as science concepts, mathematics concepts, language concepts and so on. Vygotsky theorised how these academic concepts could be developed by school aged children, but he said less about the prior to school period. Scientific concepts do not instantly develop in their final form but rather follow a process of conceptual development guided through adult-child interaction. It is understood that not any kind of social interactions can be considered developmental, but rather it is interaction which is purposeful and which is viewed as useful for a child's development. Any kind of conceptual development requires the interaction with the ideal form as presented through adult interaction in social contexts. In any stage of development, ideal forms need to be present in the real context. Ideal in the sense that it acts as a model for that which should be achieved at the end of the developmental period; and in contrast, the real form represents the beginning point of child development (Vygotsky, in: Veer, Valsiner (eds) The Vygotsky reader, Blackwell Publishers, Oxford, pp 338-350, 1994). Many studies have documented the interactions between adults and children for developing scientific concepts in formal settings but little is understood about what happens in family homes for the prior to school age period. We do not know how scientific concepts develop during infants-toddlers everyday life at home. What kinds of social interactions in everyday family life support infants and toddlers to develop early forms of science concepts? This paper presents the findings of a study of infant and toddler learning of science at home. A total of around 30h of video data were collected from three Bangladeshi families in Australia and Singapore. Three children aged from 10 to 36 months were filmed over 1year in their everyday context. Informed by cultural-historical theory, the findings indicate that a form of conscious collaboration between parents and infants-toddlers is the key for developing small science concepts from rudimentary to final form. Small science has been defined as simple scientific narration of the everyday moments that infants and toddlers experience at home with their families. It was found that it was the families who filled the gap in understanding, through actively supporting the development of their infant-toddler's higher mental function. Here the relations between infant-toddler real forms of development were carefully considered by the parents in relation to the ideal form that they created through collective dialogue of small science moments in the environment. If infants-toddlers learn these small concepts in their everyday settings, it is probable that they could link these early forms of understandings to learning abstract concepts later in school. This study contributes to understanding the nature of social interaction patterns for developing small science concepts in the everyday context of family life. This paper also provides pedagogical suggestions for early childhood science education.";;;;;;"Fleer, Marilyn/0000-0002-1224-5510; Sikder, Shukla/0000-0003-0399-5296";;;;;;;;;;;;;1871-1502;1871-1510;;;;DEC;2018;13;4;;;;;865;888;;10.1007/s11422-018-9869-x;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11422-018-9869-x;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000450913700001;View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, we investigate how digital mapping tools developed within Science and Technology Studies (STS) are used by upper secondary science students for the collaborative exploration and ordering of controversial socio-scientific issues (SSIs) found online. Our sociocultural approach to detailed analysis of video data reveals how students synchronously construct shared interactive visualizations and respond collaboratively to mediating features of the network visualization tool for handling multiple perspectives and information encountered online. The analysis shows how the tool-mediated activity provided means for students to work out what is relevant and useful in a corpus of online data. We unpack the details of the complex dynamics of this process of evaluating and categorizing websites, uncovering ways that interaction with emerging knowledge artefacts is co-constitutive of participation in the local setting. In particular, this analysis reveals how the tool-mediating activity slows down the process of judging and categorizing online material in terms of criteria such as institutional status, trustworthiness, and position of a controversy. Furthermore, it reveals that alignments and misalignments between the digital tool used and students' own logics prompted students to engage in productive collaborative negotiation of how to make sense of a controversy.;;;;;"Hillman, Thomas/AAH-6382-2019; Hillman, Thomas/JBR-8886-2023";"Hillman, Thomas/0000-0003-3325-1204; Solli, Anne/0000-0002-5667-0498; Makitalo, Asa/0000-0003-3711-3781";;;;;;;;;;;;;1556-1607;1556-1615;;;;DEC;2018;13;4;;;;;391;418;;10.1007/s11412-018-9286-x;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11412-018-9286-x;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000452050000003;View Full Record in Web of Science

Students in the study participated in an elective seminar in which they were paired with graduate student and faculty mentors on physics research projects and participated in weekly discussions about research. Using video data from student interviews and mentor interviews, we characterize two aspects of students' engagement in the physics community of practice. First, we find variations in their engagement in physics practice, which we characterize as physics activities that are connected and purposeful. Second, we characterize forms of joint work by the research project's form and structure and by patterns of interaction between undergraduates and mentors. We argue that forms of joint work influenced students' varied senses of how physics activities are connected and purposeful. Finally, we use this understanding to suggest how to better scaffold UREs.;;;;;;"Turpen, Chandra/0000-0002-2659-6936; Quan, Gina/0000-0002-7748-3894";;;;;;;;;;;;;2469-9896;;;;;DEC 7;2018;14;2;;;;;;;20124;10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.14.020124;http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.14.020124;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000452684400001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Connecting teachers' beliefs about teaching diverse learners to their noticing of inclusive classroom characteristics in videoclips;CONTEMPORARY EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY;;;;;;;;;;;;Insight in the way teachers' beliefs filter their interpretation of inclusive classrooms is vital to support teachers' competences to teach diverse learners. This study explores how three types of teacher beliefs about teaching diverse learners (i.e., professional beliefs about diversity, beliefs about differentiating the curriculum, and growth mindset) are associated with their noticing of two key aspects of effective inclusive classrooms (i.e. positive teacher-student interactions (PTSI) and differentiated instruction (DI)). Data was collected in a sample of secondary education teachers (N = 462) in Flemish schools (N = 23). Teacher beliefs were measured by survey scales, while teachers' noticing of PTSI and DI was assessed by a standardised video-based comparative judgement instrument. Survey and video data were combined in a multivariate multilevel framework. Findings indicate that teachers' professional beliefs about diversity and beliefs about differentiating the curriculum serve as filters for noticing PTSI and DI in videoclips. For teachers' growth mindset no significant relationship was found. These associations did not change when taking into account teachers' sex, age, educational background or experience. Furthermore, a small part of the differences in teachers' noticing DI is explained by the school level, suggesting that teachers within a school can share a vision. Results are discussed in the light of teacher thinking for inclusive classrooms and implications for teacher professional development.;;;;;Vantieghem, Wendelien/IWU-7364-2023;"Vanderlinde, Ruben/0000-0002-4912-3410; Vantieghem, Wendelien/0000-0001-5891-2131";;;;;;;;;;;;;0361-476X;1090-2384;;;;JAN;2019;56;;;;;;140;151;;10.1016/j.cedpsych.2019.01.002;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cedpsych.2019.01.002;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000462102300012;View Full Record in Web of Science

The case is a project on advertisement in which lower secondary students collaboratively composed multimodal commercials about various products and topics. The theoretical framework is based on sociocultural perspectives on learning and assessment, and video data of classroom interaction are subjected to detailed analysis. The findings document the consequences of decoupling production and assessment practices. The analysis show that written texts and multimodal texts have different statuses in the project because of how they are assessed and that this has consequences for students' participation as learners. In addition, the analysis shows how students position themselves differently towards resources that are intended to help them in summative assessment situations.

Aiming to fill this gap, this study develops a content coding map (CCM) to classify the content of chemistry lessons (CCL) into 12 types based on their roles and values. The CCM was constructed based on semi-structured interviews and revised by applying the initial CCM to six videotaped lessons. Furthermore, the coding was reviewed by an expert committee to confirm the content validity and evaluated by 86 in-service teachers using a questionnaire with responses measured on a five-point Likert scale to test for face validity. These 12 types of CCL were organized into five related groups in the CCM: core knowledge and practices (CKP), connections among CKP (C-CKP), expansion of CKP (E-CKP), scaffolding for CKP (S-CKP), and meaningless content in relation to CKP (MC-CKP). Each group is illustrated and discussed using specific types of CCL. The CCM, which provides a new way to explore chemistry classrooms, can be used as an analytic tool for chemistry educators to investigate the CCL and can serve as a guide for chemistry teachers when designing lessons.;;;;;He, Peng/A-6535-2018;"He, Peng/0000-0002-2877-0117; Li, Langsen/0000-0003-4290-5214";;;;;;;;;;;;;1109-4028;1756-1108;;;;JAN 2;2019;20;1;;;;;246;257;;10.1039/c8rp00085a;http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8rp00085a;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000482260100019;View Full Record in Web of Science

The focus is a short video of 'Luke', aged six, who at snack time declines to request an available food item (carrot, tomato or apple) with the available Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS); instead deploying embodied, idiosyncratic communication including gaze, vocalisation and object manipulation to request raisins. The article explores the potential of a hybridized approach for understanding Luke's communicative competencies which draws upon the theoretical perspectives of Ethnography of Communication, Conversation Analysis and Multimodal (Inter)Action Analysis; and uses two forms of multimodal transcription (the multimodal matrix and annotated video stills).

Spatial thinking-which includes spatial orientation and spatial visualization-contributes to early mathematical thinking and children have the capacity to demonstrate abstract spatial concepts both verbally and nonverbally, yet may be overlooked in practice. This qualitative study analyses selected excerpts from a corpus of video data of 4- and 5-year-old children participating in a 6-week project designed to support children's spatial thinking skills. A conversation analytic approach is taken to demonstrate children's spatial thinking made visible through gesture and action. Showing how this is done by analyzing the verbal and nonverbal elements of back-and-forth interactions, with explicit attention to the how of intentional teaching, reveals the interrelationship between learning and teaching. In addition, the critical role played by in-the-moment formative assessment of children's demonstrated spatial thinking and the maximization of opportunities for teachers to support concept acquisition are emphasized. The analysis of authentic interactions thus serves as a provocation for professional learning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2158-2440;;;;;FEB 9;2019;9;1;;;;;;;2,15824E+15;10.1177/2158244019829551;http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2158244019829551;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000458764000001;View Full Record in Web of Science
J;"Steier, R; Kersting, M; Silseth, K";;;;"Steier, Rolf; Kersting, Magdalena; Silseth, Kenneth";;;Imagining with improvised representations in CSCL environments;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER-SUPPORTED COLLABORATIVE LEARNING;;;;;;;;;;;;This study contributes to our understanding of meaning making in CSCL environments by examining a specific aspect of collaborative problem solving in which students improvise, introduce, and make meaning with representations in disciplinary domains. These situations include the embodied and imaginative processes of discovering new representational possibilities and artifact meanings. Much of the research on student-generated representations examines situations in which students are asked by a teacher or researcher explicitly to produce representations. However, we need more knowledge about how students within CSCL settings introduce representations from outside of the designed environment or intended task in order to solve a problem. To unpack the processes of collaborative improvisation and meaning making, we take a sociocultural stance towards imagining. This stance involves considering the socially and materially situated ways that participants express new possibilities and alternative situations that extend beyond the present reality. Focusing on a specific task based on maps as disciplinary representations, we analyze video data of upper secondary physics students working in small groups in a co-located CSCL environment. To characterize shifts across boundaries of several modalities including the verbal and gestural, digital and physical, and 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional, we identify emergent representations as imaginative productions. The findings extend current research on collaborative meaning making by bringing attention to the processes through which improvised representations emerge.. This knowledge is key to facilitating the discovery of representational possibilities in CSCL environments.;;;;;Kersting, Magdalena/AAF-2681-2019;"Kersting, Magdalena/0000-0003-3568-8397; Steier, Rolf/0000-0001-9809-3169";;;;;;;;;;;;;1556-1607;1556-1615;;;;MAR;2019;14;1;;;;;109;136;;10.1007/s11412-019-09295-1;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11412-019-09295-1;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000466972100005;View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper focuses on data from one geography lesson involving 29 students. It reports findings from a detailed micro analysis of infra-action of video data and lesson transcripts, comprising six Talkwall episodes. Through this analysis the concept of affordance is critiqued and we illustrate the infra-action possibilities that may facilitate the creative co-construction of ideas in the material-dialogic space created by the use of Talkwall.

This study investigated how two forms of scaffolding embedded in dynamic visualizations, expert guidance and generating guidance, can foster ELLs' and non-ELLs' understanding of unobservable scientific phenomena. While interacting with dynamic visualizations, students in the expert guidance condition were provided with scientifically accurate explanations to interpret visual representations, whereas students in the generating guidance condition were prompted to generate their own explanations using visual representations. The results show the significant advantage of generating guidance over expert guidance for both ELLs and non-ELLs, although students in the generating guidance condition did not receive feedback on their generated artifacts. Analyses of video data and log data from 40 pairs revealed that each form of scaffolding affected the quantity and quality of linguistically diverse students' conversations. The results show that generating guidance enabled students, particularly ELLs, to engage in discourse-rich practices to evaluate various sources of evidence from the visualization and compare the evidence to their alternative ideas to develop a coherent understanding of the target concepts. This study shows the unique benefits of generating guidance as an effective strategy to support linguistically diverse students' science learning with dynamic visualizations.;;;;;;Bedell, Kristin/0000-0002-3384-4192;;;;;;;;;;;;;0022-4308;1098-2736;;;;MAR;2019;56;3;;;;;270;301;;10.1002/tea.21519;http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tea.21519;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000459608800002;View Full Record in Web of Science

Internet-based technologies have been successfully used elsewhere to deliver instrumental lessons. A collaboration between the authors, North Yorkshire Music Action Zone and YouCanPlay allowed the delivery of instrumental lessons using Skype in combination with a Roland VR-3EX, an AV Mixer which offers 3 camera angles and good quality sound. Our aim was to repurpose existing technology to provide instrumental lessons in remote rural communities. The study was conducted in two-phases: a pilot study in North Yorkshire; and a further roll-out of the lessons in four additional areas (Cornwall; Cumbria; Durham/Darlington; and East Riding of Yorkshire). We wished to investigate the technical challenges and pedagogical aspects of the delivery, and also compare digitally-delivered and face-to-face instrumental lessons to explore the differences in behaviour. Data collected included pre- and post-project interviews with teachers, recordings of the teachers' first and last lessons, and post-project questionnaires from pupils and their parents. Results suggested that there were technical challenges relating to sound, video and connection quality, and the physical environment of the lessons, some of which were alleviated by the Roland VR-3EX. Some concerns expressed by teachers in the initial interviews failed to materialise; others were overcome to some extent. Pupils concentrated well, were motivated to practice, and made good progress. Further analysis of the video data has allowed the comparison of face-to-face and digitally-delivered lessons. All teachers found the digital teaching more challenging than their usual face-to-face teaching; however, all reported that they would undertake similar teaching again. This paper focuses upon the exploring the behaviour of participants observed in the lessons.

In the scenario, mind mapping is used to provide both curricular structure as well as support for student questioning. The fidelity of structure and the process of implementation were verified by interviews, video data and a product collection. Results show that the scenario was relevant for teachers, practical in use and effective for guiding student questioning. Results also suggest that shared responsibility for classroom mind maps contributed to more intensive collective knowledge construction.;;;;;Stokhof, Harry/GWM-4684-2022;Stokhof, Harry/0000-0001-9590-5520;;;;;;;;;;;;;0157-244X;1573-1898;;;;APR;2019;49;2;;;;;347;369;;10.1007/s11165-017-9625-3;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11165-017-9625-3;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000463628800003;View Full Record in Web of Science

Model use can be characterized by three aspects: (1) the characteristics of the model, (2) the integration of the model into instruction, and (3) the use of models to foster scientific reasoning. However, there were no empirical results describing the implementation of National Education Standards in science instruction concerning the use of models. Therefore, the present study investigated the implementation of different aspects of model use in German biology instruction. Two biology lessons on the topic neurobiology in grade nine of 32 biology teachers were videotaped (N=64 videos). These lessons were analysed using an event-based coding manual according to three aspects of model described above. Rasch analysis of the coded categories was conducted and showed reliable measurement. In the first analysis, we identified 68 lessons where a total of 112 different models were used. The in-depth analysis showed that special aspects of an elaborate model use according to several categories of scientific reasoning were rarely implemented in biology instruction. A critical reflection of the used model (N=25 models; 22.3%) and models to demonstrate scientific reasoning (N=26 models; 23.2%) were seldom observed. Our findings suggest that pre-service biology teacher education and professional development initiatives in Germany have to focus on both aspects.";;;;;"von Kotzebue, Lena/GNP-7622-2022; Neuhaus, Birgit J./K-1272-2014";"von Kotzebue, Lena/0000-0001-6056-8528; Neuhaus, Birgit J./0000-0001-6031-9660; Fortsch, Christian/0000-0002-3625-6791";;;;;;;;;;;;;0157-244X;1573-1898;;;;APR;2019;49;2;;;;;437;463;;10.1007/s11165-017-9624-4;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11165-017-9624-4;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000463628800007;View Full Record in Web of Science

There is evidence that developing information literacy skills in undergraduates improves their research skills, writing, and GPAs. Our objective was to integrate information literacy skills into a first semester introductory biology laboratory with a multi-week, inquiry-based module that leverages primary literature. Here we describe the module, which challenges students to develop and test a hypothesis related to parental care behaviour in birds. Students form hypotheses based on literature searching done during librarian-led information literacy sessions, produce an annotated bibliography, collect and analyse video data of barn swallows feeding their offspring, and present their findings. Analysis of students' annotated bibliographies indicates that 83% of the referenced papers were appropriate for developing their specific hypotheses. The key elements of a successful information literacy training plan include faculty-librarian collaboration, multiple classroom or laboratory sessions that introduce or utilize information literacy, and relevance of the information literacy training to an assignment. By introducing information literacy early inbiology curricula, departments can develop tiered information literacy plans that incorporate opportunities for students to use and refine these skills throughout their studies.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0021-9266;2157-6009;;;;AUG 7;2020;54;4;;;;;396;403;;10.1080/00219266.2019.1600569;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00219266.2019.1600569;;APR 2019;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000465735200001;View Full Record in Web of Science

To address these research gaps, we used a corpus of classroom video data from a beginning-level adult ESOL classroom in the United States and applied Conversation Analysis to examine how the class teacher employs various gestural and linguistic resources to construct L2 VEs. We also conducted a 4-month microgenetic analysis to document qualitative changes in learners' understanding of the meaning of specific L2 VIs which were previously explained by the teacher. Findings revealed that the learners' use of gestures allows for an externalisation of thinking processes providing visible output for inspection by the teacher and peers. These findings can inform educators' understanding about L2 vocabulary development as a gradual process of controlling the right gestural and linguistic resources for appropriate communicative purposes.;;;;;Tai, Kevin W H/HJA-8110-2022;Tai, Kevin W.

Previous research has examined several instructional approaches to foster students' conceptual learning. Reliable and adequate use of technical terms in science instruction is also essential for fostering students' conceptual learning. However, current studies of the analyses of the use of technical terms and their effects on fostering students' conceptual understanding in biology lessons are lacking. In this study, we first conducted a descriptive analysis of the technical terms used in selected videotaped German 9(th)-grade biology lessons (N = 43) on neurobiology. Then, we conducted multilevel analyses of the effects of using different technical terms in a biology lesson on students' achievement and situational interest. Our descriptive results showed that on average teachers (N = 43) talked more and used more technical terms compared to their students and that many different technical terms were used in our analysed lessons. Furthermore, our multilevel analyses showed negative effects of using a high number of different technical terms on both student outcome variables. We conclude that a well-considered, but simple, reduction of technical terms in biology lessons could positively affect students' learning of conceptual knowledge. Therefore, the findings in this study have implications that teachers should use minimally necessary topic-relevant technical terms in biology instruction with the additional use of biological core ideas. We suggest further research in pre-service and in-service teacher education programmes to evaluate teachers' effective use of technical terms in biology lessons essential for fostering conceptual learning.;;;;;Neuhaus, Birgit J./K-1272-2014;"Neuhaus, Birgit J./0000-0001-6031-9660; Fortsch, Christian/0000-0002-3625-6791";;;;;;;;;;;;;0263-5143;1470-1138;;;;APR 2;2020;38;2;;;;;227;251;;10.1080/02635143.2019.1609436;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02635143.2019.1609436;;APR 2019;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000470482500001;View Full Record in Web of Science
J;Bohlmann, N;;;;Bohlmann, Nina;;;Unequal bodies: corporeality and social inequality in mathematics classrooms;ZDM-MATHEMATICS EDUCATION;;;;;;;;;;;;This paper addresses teachers' corporeality and its influence on the structuring of mathematics classroom interaction. The present contribution explores the way a teacher's bodily activity is implicated in the (re)production of social inequality, and challenges the assumption that the teaching and learning of mathematics is primarily a linguistic and semiotic accomplishment. I argue that the teacher's body is an active force in the formation of mathematically 'able' and 'less able' students. Drawing on the work of Bernstein (Pedagogy, symbolic control, and identity: Theory, research, critique (Revised Edition), Rowman & Littlefield, Lanham, 2000) and his sociological theory of pedagogy, and expanding his tools to address corporeal factors, I show how students are positioned as high-performing within structures of classroom interaction. Video data from classroom interaction is used to track differences in how teachers reveal and conceal structural peculiarities of school mathematics. Comparing the interaction of different teachers illustrates the role that corporeality plays in establishing distinctive orientations to meaning-making in the mathematics classroom.;;;;;ARSLAN, Okan/AAA-3232-2020;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1863-9690;1863-9704;;;;MAY;2019;51;2;;;SI;;263;275;;10.1007/s11858-018-1005-6;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11858-018-1005-6;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000468121600004;View Full Record in Web of Science

It highlights the quantitative increase in active learning that occurs for one instructor and discusses how the affordances of the flexible classroom support qualitatively better instructor-student and student-peer interaction during active learning. Background: Research has shown that students benefit from active learning, but instructors still perceive many barriers to implementing it. Flexible classrooms may reduce some of these barriers, and their affordances may promote better student engagement and allow instructors to use more active learning than traditional lecture-style classrooms do. Research Questions: What are the differences in the amount of active learning used by an instructor between flexible classrooms and traditional classrooms? How do instructors and students use the affordances of flexible classrooms during active learning? Methodology: An instructor at a large Midwestern university taught the course Introduction to Electronics Circuits in a traditional classroom one semester and in a flexible classroom the next. The two research questions were addressed through complementary quantitative and qualitative analyses of video data, classroom observations, and instructor interviews to detail the amount of active learning and the way the instructor facilitated it in the flexible classroom. Findings: The time the instructor devoted to active learning increased in the flexible classroom, while the time she devoted to instructor-led examples decreased. The affordances of the flexible classroom also encouraged more frequent and better student-instructor and student-peer interaction.;;;;;;"Finelli, Cynthia/0000-0001-9148-1492; Johnson, Aaron/0000-0001-6989-2340; Su, Magel/0000-0003-4898-5024";;;;;;;;;;;;;0018-9359;1557-9638;;;;MAY;2019;62;2;;;;;91;98;;10.1109/TE.2018.2867447;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TE.2018.2867447;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000467032200002;View Full Record in Web of Science

Research indicates that explicitly training peers how to interact with classmates with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can increase the likelihood of peer-directed behavior; however, less is known about other strategies that can be used to support the peer-related social interactions of children with ASD and how those strategies may be used in conjunction with trained peers. Video data were analyzed from 23 classrooms using the Learning Experiences and Alternative Program for Preschoolers and Their Parents model (an inclusive preschool program that emphasizes peer training and peer support) to provide a snapshot of environmental features and the role of implementation fidelity that may enhance or inhibit the social interaction of 52 children with ASD.

This paper reports on multi-method research study which considered in detail what was occurring while participants undertook the equine-assisted intervention under study. The intervention was implemented with young people with chronic mental health and behavioural problems for whom talk-based interventions were not working. Previous research has demonstrated long-term health and wellbeing benefits in recipients of the intervention. The three datasets were video data, psycho-physiological data, in this case, skin conductivity response, which is an indicator of emotional arousal, and experiential interview data. Our findings indicated that learning natural horsemanship skills through this intervention caused participants to experience emotional arousal when they asked the horse to perform a task. We would suggest that this process of experiencing a positive outcome following emotional arousal helps participants to achieve the reported behavioural outcomes from this intervention which include increased calmness, assertiveness, focus, empathy, communication skills, taking responsibility for behaviour, planning and confidence as a learner. These changes in behaviour then translate from the intervention to the participants' everyday lives, thereby achieving the changes in behaviour recorded by those independent practitioners (i.e., social workers and teachers) who refer individuals to this intervention. Abstract Though long alluded to, there is now an accumulation of evidence of the vital contribution that emotion makes to learning. Within this broad advance in understanding is a growing body of research emphasising the embodied nature of this emotion-based learning. The study presented here is a pilot study using a mixed-method approach (combining both physiological and experiential methodologies) to give a picture of the emotional landscape of people's learning through the intervention under study. This has allowed researchers to examine mediating pathways that may underlie any effects of an equine-assisted intervention. This study specifically focuses on examining the role of emotion. The intervention under study was used with young people with chronic mental health and behavioural problems for whom talk-based interventions were not working. Nine healthy participants aged 18-24 undertook the equine intervention, with an initial group having emotion-related psycho-physiological changes (skin conductance responses) measured while viewing their experience on video, and a further two participants experiencing a development of the methodology as their physiological responses were captured in real time during the intervention. The sessions were analysed by a group of five cross-disciplinary researchers to determine when significant learning episodes occurred, and the findings were that this learning was associated with powerful skin conductance responses. The qualitative element of the research entailed the participants watching themselves on video undertaking the equine intervention. They were asked to stop the video and share any changes in emotion at any point while watching. All participants experienced a positive temporal change in mood as the intervention progressed. All results supported the findings that emotional arousal occurred in relation to the participants asking the horse to perform a task. This paper will offer two novel contributions: (1) description of a new methodology for investigating the mechanism of action occurring in this type of intervention and (2) findings from the exploration of the intervention via psycho-physiological and experiential mechanisms.;;;;;"Callaway, Andrew J/I-9174-2012; Hemingway, Ann/AAD-2512-2019";"Callaway, Andrew J/0000-0003-0987-9608; Hemingway, Ann/0000-0002-0920-3897";;;;;;;;;;;;;2076-2615;;;;;JUN;2019;9;6;;;;;;;303;10.3390/ani9060303;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani9060303;;;;;;;;31159199;;;;;WOS:000475348700020;View Full Record in Web of Science

Grounded on dialogic theory, the research examines and characterizes the emergence of co-creative processes in an interactive technology framework. To this end, this paper reports on an empirical study with secondary-school students who followed a technology-enhanced dialogic pedagogy that promotes co-creativity in real secondary-education classrooms. Qualitative methodology was used to document real-life multimodal interaction. The video data was processed in different phases to develop an analytical framework capable of identifying strings of episodes indicating typical facets of technology-enhanced co-creative processes. Results provided seven typical co-creative facets: 1) collective framing of the task; 2) overcoming technological challenges; 3) engagement in generating a shared pool of ideas; 4) developing intersubjectivity; 5) fusing ideas for a new perspective; 6) evaluation of ideas and 7) making ideas a reality. Furthermore, the findings show that each co-creative facet covers specific objectives in the co-creativity cycle and presents distinct features along three key dimensions: a) co-creative processes involved, b) typical discourse features and, c) dialogic use of specific technology affordances (e.g. visibility, interactivity, responsiveness, multimodal representation, provisional, stability, re-usability) for co-creating. Future educational implications to design a more effective technology-enhanced dialogic pedagogy that can connect learners to their creative potential are also discussed.";;;;;"ARSLAN, Okan/AAA-3232-2020; Pifarré, Manoli/C-6865-2008";Pifarré, Manoli/0000-0002-4271-4824;;;;;;;;;;;;;1871-1871;1878-0423;;;;JUN;2019;32;;;;;;1;16;;10.1016/j.tsc.2019.01.004;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tsc.2019.01.004;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000468866500001;View Full Record in Web of Science

This new pedagogical approach was tried out with 2nd graders in 3 schools in Singapore: instead of the typical immersion approach to teaching reading skills in English, emergent simultaneous biliterates were offered translanguaging opportunities. The goal of this 'proof of concept' was to teach vocabulary, grammar and comprehension in English through systematic and judicious use of Chinese and Malay. 14 h of video data from 3 schools was coded for interactional patterns in which the teacher and students translanguaged. The focus of this paper is on qualitatively analyzing the teacher's pedagogical strategies and individual students' responses. Translanguaging stimulated metalinguistic awareness which helped individual students notice nuances in punctuation, orthography, grammatical structures and meaning that had previously gone unnoticed. Finally this study revealed that while teaching simultaneous bilinguals/biliterates it is important for teacher training to highlight moments when translanguaging might not be required for learning the target language.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1479-0718;1747-7530;;;;JUL 3;2019;16;3;;;;;286;301;;10.1080/14790718.2018.1447943;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14790718.2018.1447943;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000474301100005;View Full Record in Web of Science

While calls for CS education are often framed in terms of national and economic competitiveness, there is a growing interest amongst equity scholars in curricular interventions that directly engage the ethical and sociopolitical issues surrounding CS and its role in society. Yet, less attention has been given to how sociocultural dynamics of classrooms play a mediating role in these spaces.

Closure of the gutter has previously been treated as a cognitive aspect. Here, interactional video data are analysed, with participants organizing ten separate comic panels. The analysis focuses on participants' talk about the gutter, and how this constructs social actions. The results show how participants co-construct the gutter as meaningful space, hereby organizing time, actions, and events in narratives. The paper evinces that gutters are co-constructed as too narrow or too broad, relating chronologically and logically to surrounding panels.

For summarizing single instructional quality features, researchers have created a model of three basic dimensions (classroom management, supportive climate, and cognitive activation) of instructional quality mainly through observing mathematics instruction. Considering this model as valid for all subjects and as usable for describing instruction, we used it in this study which aimed to analyze characteristics of instructional quality in biology lessons of high-achieving and low-achieving classes, independently of content. Therefore, we used the data of three different previous video studies of biology instruction conducted in Germany. From each video study, we selected three high-achieving and three low-achieving classes (N = 18 teachers; 35 videos) for our multiple-case study, in which conspicuous characteristics of instructional quality features were qualitatively identified and qualitatively analyzed. The amount of these characteristics was counted in a quantitative way in all the videos. The characteristics we found could be categorized using the model of three basic dimensions of instructional quality despite some subject-specific differences for biology instruction. Our results revealed that many more characteristics were observable in high-achieving classes than in low-achieving classes. Thus, we believe that this model could be used to describe biology instruction independently of the content. We also make the claims about the qualities for biology instruction-working with concentration in a content-structured environment, getting challenged in higher order thinking, and getting praised for performance-that could have positive influence on students' achievement.";;;;;Neuhaus, Birgit J./K-1272-2014;"Neuhaus, Birgit J./0000-0001-6031-9660; Fortsch, Christian/0000-0002-3625-6791";;;;;;;;;;;;;0157-244X;1573-1898;;;;OCT;2019;49;5;;;;;1457;1491;;10.1007/s11165-017-9663-x;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11165-017-9663-x;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000492471000014;View Full Record in Web of Science

Echoing student answers is a controversial strategy of classroom discourse, as some critics see it as a bad habit and consequently deny its use in the classroom. The aim of this research project was to learn more about the perceptions of unprejudiced, prospective teachers on this controversial type of teacher feedback. Therefore, two short videos of a simulated lesson with and without teacher echo were created. A sample of 410 teacher trainees was asked to rate the perceived instructional quality and answer a knowledge test about the lesson contents. Results showed no significant differences in perceived cognitive activation and teacher dominance, but higher perceived constructive support and better knowledge acquisition when using the teacher echo. Thus, its application seems to be more beneficial than harmful.;;;;;Wagner, Marlene/AAP-4434-2021;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0144-3410;1469-5820;;;;MAR 15;2020;40;3;;;;;336;348;;10.1080/01443410.2019.1675868;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01443410.2019.1675868;;OCT 2019;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000489798200001;View Full Record in Web of Science

In Cellverse, players work in pairs to explore a human lung cell and diagnose and treat a dangerous genetic disorder. Cellverse is being designed by the Collaborative Learning Environments in Virtual Reality (CLEVR) team, an interdisciplinary team consisting of game designers, educational researchers, and graduate and undergraduate students. Using a design-based research approach, we have enlisted the help of both subject matter experts and user testers to iteratively design and improve Cellverse. The objective of this paper is to share how user and expert feedback can inform and enhance the development of learning games. We describe how we gather and synthesize information to review and revise our game from in-game observations, semi-structured interviews, and video data. We discuss the input of subject matter experts, present feedback from our user testers, and describe how input from both parties influenced the design of Cellverse.

Twenty-four participants (aged 10-11 years) in two locations-primary school classrooms located 300 miles apart in the UK-engaged in simultaneous collaborative activity to solve a History mystery task. Audio-video data recorded in the first minute of the activity were analysed to explore the emergence of collaborative working practices both within groups in the same location (resizing for shared reading) and between the groups communicating via video conferencing software and through the flick multi-touch gesture (sharing clues between groups). The results indicated that most groups focused first on the establishment of intra-group collaboration before reaching out to their remotely located partners. However, when the second data set was analysed, audio data from delayed interviews conducted after the original study, participants reported that the discussion between groups supported by the flick gesture was the most important and memorable feature of the activity.

One goal of CBL is to integrate basic biomedical knowledge and its application to concrete patient cases and their clinical management. In this context, we focus the role of teacher questions as triggers for reproductive vs. elaborative student responses. Specifically, our research questions concern the kinds of questions posed by clinical teachers, the kinds of responses given by students, the prediction of student responses based upon teacher questions, and the differences between the two medical disciplines in focus of our study, internal medicine and surgery. Methods: We analyse 19 videotaped seminars (nine internal medicine, ten surgery) taught by clinicians and attended by advanced medical students. Multiple raters performed a low-inference rating process using a theory-based categorical scheme with satisfactory interrater-reliability. Results: We found that medical teachers mostly posed initial (instead of follow-up) questions and that their questions were more often closed (instead of open). Also, more reasoning (than reproductive) questions were posed. A high rate of student non-response was observed while elaborative and reproductive student responses had a similar prevalence. In the prediction context, follow-up reasoning questions were associated with low non-response and many elaborative answers. In contrast, the highest student non-response rate followed open reproduction questions and initial reasoning questions. Most reproductive statements by students were made following closed reproduction questions. Conclusions: These results deepen our understanding of interactive, questions-driven medical teaching and provide an empirical basis for clinical teachers to use questions in didactically fruitful ways.;;;;;"Hapfelmeier, Alexander/I-9966-2019; Seidel, Tina/C-6221-2009";"Hapfelmeier, Alexander/0000-0001-6765-6352; Seidel, Tina/0000-0002-2578-1208; Hausler, Janina/0000-0001-6731-0714; Gartmeier, Martin/0000-0002-5025-0003";;;;;;;;;;;;;;1472-6920;;;;DEC 5;2019;19;1;;;;;;;455;10.1186/s12909-019-1895-1;http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12909-019-1895-1;;;;;;;;31805913;;;;;WOS:000509745400001;View Full Record in Web of Science

To accomplish this, the study relates group-level video data analysis with students' self-reported emotional experiences. The results indicate that students' negative emotional experiences related to the task prior to collaborative working increase the group's emotion regulation during the collaboration and that negative group interactions negatively affect students' emotional experiences after the task. The study also shows that even though group-level regulation is more likely to change the valence of the group's interaction from negative to positive, regulation does not always succeed in making a difference to the students' overall emotional experiences.;;;;;Manty, Kristiina/AAX-6476-2021;"Manty, Kristiina/0000-0003-0538-8860; Tormanen, Tiina/0000-0001-5421-4213";;;;;;;;;;;;;0883-0355;1873-538X;;;;;2020;102;;;;;;;;101589;10.1016/j.ijer.2020.101589;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijer.2020.101589;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000575425300023;View Full Record in Web of Science

In addition, their classes were observed and recorded on video. Data gathered were analysed with the software MAXQDA. The analysis focused on the difficulties that these teachers faced when teaching the uniform rectilinear movement (MRU). It is concluded that, in general terms, the beliefs were inconsistent with the teaching practices. It was also revealed that teachers are more constructivist when they talk about what they think is right and should be done than when they talk on what they will truly do in their teaching practices.

J;"Devi, A; Fleer, M; Li, L";;;;"Devi, Anamika; Fleer, Marilyn; Li, Liang";;;Preschool teachers' pedagogical positioning in relation to children's imaginative play;EARLY CHILD DEVELOPMENT AND CARE;;;;;;;;;;;;In some Western contexts, the pedagogical practices of teachers are to intentionally involve in play-based learning through sustained shared conversations to extend children's thinking (Meade, A., Williamson, J., Stuart, M., Smorti, S., Robinson, L., & Carroll-Lind, J. (2013). Adult-child sustained shared thinking: Who, how and when? Early Education, 53(Autumn/Winter), 7-12). In this study, video data of eight teachers interacting with four focus children during imaginative play and their interview data were gathered. Both Vygotsky's (2004) concept of imaginative play and Kravtsov and Kravtsova's (2010) concept of double subjectivity were used to identify six different pedagogical positions taken by teachers in children's play. After analysing the video footage and teachers' interview data, it was evident that the participating teachers drew primarily upon these six different types of pedagogical positioning in play to intentionally teach children. Our analysis sought to determine whether the teachers were imagining concepts with the children or whether they were outside of the play. This paper argues that the teachers' pedagogical positioning is important for conceptualising teaching practice in Australia.;;;;;;"Devi, Anamika/0000-0001-9290-4565; Fleer, Marilyn/0000-0002-1224-5510";;;;;;;;;;;;;0300-4430;1476-8275;;;;DEC 10;2021;191;16;;;;;2471;2483;;10.1080/03004430.2020.1717479;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03004430.2020.1717479;;JAN 2020;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000509017400001;View Full Record in Web of Science

We also investigate the role of translanguaging in support of children's communication and interaction in this activity. Video data of show-and-tell activity in two dual language preschool classrooms were analyzed for the actional, verbal, and visual modes used by children as well as for features of their transmodal repertoire. Qualitative analyses revealed specific patterns in EB children's employment of multimodal resources, in response to presentation purposes and show-and-tell routines and structures. Children's translanguaging practices were flexible and supported their presentation purposes and participation across show-and-tell routines. Findings have implications for ways of facilitating show-and-tell and how teachers can promote students' transmodal practices in support of their learning and engagement in this activity.

We identify and focus on microacts of self-determination, defined here as, as contestations and moves to elsewhere that shift activity and dictate future status. In particular, we consider if and how such microacts that could be cast as idiosyncratic build and shape new possibilities for learning and social interaction, what we refer to here as learning from below. Learning from below reflects an effort to move beyond the binary of individual versus collective activity and to situate scholarship on social and historical movements and forms of decolonial insurgency as germane to sociocultural and interactional studies of learning. Drawing from an extensive data set which included ethnographic fieldnotes, semi-structured interviews, and over 70 hours of video data collected from an after-school community tinkering program, we found that children's everyday forms of self-determination were much more than individual acts; they emerge from social histories and carried future potentialities that shaped learning and intellectual life within the setting. This central finding is anchored in an analysis of over 600 examples, as well as two cases that look more closely at individual children's participation.";;;;;"Smith, John/HJB-2300-2022; Smith, John/GYJ-1302-2022";;;;;;;;;;;;;;2210-6561;2210-657X;;;;MAR;2020;24;;;;;;;;100373;10.1016/j.lcsi.2019.100373;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lcsi.2019.100373;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000530894000026;View Full Record in Web of Science

J;Krist, C;;;;Krist, Christina;;;Examining How Classroom Communities Developed Practice-Based Epistemologies for Science Through Analysis of Longitudinal Video Data;JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY;;;;;;;;;;;;Recent reforms in science education emphasize having students develop and refine core disciplinary ideas through participation in science knowledge-building practices. Supporting students' meaningful participation in these practices is challenging, in part because our understanding of how this kind of participation develops is underexplored. This paper characterizes the epistemic dimension of classroom scientific practice-the underlying assumptions and criteria guiding students' knowledge-building work-in moment-to-moment interactions, and how their use of these criteria shifted over time. These patterns of change illustrate how, by 8th grade, students were more consistently using sophisticated disciplinary forms of epistemic criteria than they were in 6th grade. The shifts toward disciplinary sophistication were cumulative over time and across content areas, suggesting that they reflected a shift in something other than content knowledge gains. Yet these cumulative shifts did not occur in a clean, predictable progression toward sophistication. This study documents the details of these shifts over time and across content areas. By providing an empirical account of the evolution of students' knowledgebuilding work in practice over time, this study argues for the centrality of epistemic learning goals in science education and proposes implications for how to measure and support students' meaningful participation in scientific practices in contextually valid ways.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0022-0663;1939-2176;;;;APR;2020;112;3;;;;;420;443;;10.1037/edu0000417;http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/edu0000417;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000519968800002;View Full Record in Web of Science

The paper investigates the frequency and forms of teacher-given feedback to pupils during a class work period. The focus lies on a period while pupils were engaged in fulfilling a writing task (producing texts). Furthermore, the distribution of feedback on the pupils is considered. The impact of specific forms of feedback towards the quality of the texts produced by pupils is a subject of interest, too. The present analyses emerge from the DFG-project NaSch1 (Narrative Schreibkompetenz in Klasse 1) and are based on video data captured in the PERLE study. All in all, the video corpus comprises 47 recorded lesson-units with an approximate length of 90 & x202f;min. each and a total sample of 540 first-grade pupils. The overall results indicate significant differences in teachers' feedback-behavior. Elaborated feedback (such as tutorial support) occurs less frequently than basic forms of feedback. Also, there is a tendency for boys to receive more feedback overall. Another finding is that the initiative to provide feedback originates more frequently from pupils than from teachers. Multilevel analysis on the impact of feedback towards text-quality reveal no significant effects for elaborated feedback. A negative correlation between the feedback on the writing content and the linguistic dimension of the text quality are recognized.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1434-663X;1862-5215;;;;JUN;2020;23;3;;;;;591;611;;10.1007/s11618-020-00950-0;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11618-020-00950-0;;MAY 2020;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000532148600002;View Full Record in Web of Science
J;"Kim, J; Suzuka, K; Yakel, E";;;;"Kim, Jihyun; Suzuka, Kara; Yakel, Elizabeth";;;Reusing qualitative video data: matching reuse goals and criteria for selection;ASLIB JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT;;;;;;;;;;;;Purpose This research investigated the reuse of Video Records of Practice (VRPs) - i.e. a type of qualitative data documenting teaching and learning in educational settings. It studied how reusers' purposes and experience-level with VRP reuse influence the importance of various VRP selection criteria and how these differ depending on whether the main goal for reuse was research or teaching. It also examined whether two different dimensions of qualitative research - reflexivity and context - were factors in VRP reuse. Design/methodology/approach The study reports on surveys of reusers at four VRP repositories. Questions were based on the literature and interviews with VRP reusers. The response rate was 20.6% (180 of 872 distributed surveys). This paper focused on 126 respondents who affirmatively responded they reused VRPs from a repository. Findings Researchers using VRPs were primarily interested in examining a broad range of processes in education and studying/improving ways to measure differences and growth in education. Reusers with teaching goals were commonly interested in VRPs to engage learners in showing examples/exemplars of - and reflecting on - teaching and learning. These differences between research and teaching led to varied expectations about VRPs, such as the amount of content needed and necessary contextual information to support reuse. Research limitations/implications While repositories focus on exposing content, understanding and communicating certain qualities of that content can help reusers identify VRPs and align goals with selection decisions.

J;Riordan, JP;;;;Riordan, John-Paul;;;A method and framework for video-based pedagogy analysis;RESEARCH IN SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGICAL EDUCATION;;;;;;;;;;;;"Background Bringing about conceptual change in school science classrooms is difficult for teachers. Researchers in this field have struggled to influence classroom practice. Purpose The present research presents a method and a framework for video-based pedagogy analysis. Sample Six groups of 11-year-old pupils took part (three girls and three boys) in each expert micro-teaching interview, led by a science specialist (Advanced Skills Teacher). A 'Concurrent Verbal Protocol and Retrospective Debriefing' interview happened with the teacher approximately one month later. Six teachers and thirty-six pupils participated altogether. Design and method Three research methods (expert micro-teaching, verbal protocols and retrospective debriefing) were used. Data were video-recorded and managed using NVivo. About fifteen hours of video data were analysed using grounded theory methods. The interpretivist theoretical perspective (symbolic interactionism) was underpinned by a social constructionist epistemology. What can be considered evidence is inevitably affected by the researcher's methodological position. So what constitutes reliable evidence can be contentious. Appropriate criteria for evaluating the grounded theory emerging from this study were used. Interpretivist approaches for investigating conceptual change in school science are necessary to complement positivist literature. This approach, proved successful in other fields, is new to this context. Data were recorded in 2013. Results Findings are presented as a Pedagogy Analysis Framework which uses the concepts: means (including information, misinformation and disinformation), strategy (on a spectrum from micro-strategies, through tactics to macro-strategies;), ends (physical changes, individual mental changes and group mental changes), and accidents. Conclusions The method allows teachers to help the researcher understand incidents in video-data that are not evident to any external observer. The framework could help strategic dialogue between teachers, student teachers, mentors, teacher educators, and educational researchers.";;;;;Riordan, John-Paul/GWZ-4083-2022;Riordan, John-Paul/0000-0001-9016-5578;;;;;;;;;;;;;0263-5143;1470-1138;;;;JAN 2;2022;40;1;;;;;53;75;;10.1080/02635143.2020.1776243;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02635143.2020.1776243;;JUN 2020;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000547327700001;View Full Record in Web of Science
J;"Xu, LH; Ferguson, J; Tytler, R";;;;"Xu, Lihua; Ferguson, Joseph; Tytler, Russell";;;Student Reasoning About the Lever Principle Through Multimodal Representations: a Socio-Semiotic Approach;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION;;;;;;;;;;;;"There is increasing recognition of the multimodal representational nature of science discovery practices and the roles of multiple and multimodal representations in students' meaning making in science (Lemke,1998; Tytler, Prain, Hubber, & Waldrip,2013; Tang,International Journal of Science Education, 38(13), 2069-2095,2016). However, research in this area is only starting to explore how these different modal meanings interact (Tytler, Prain, Aranda, Ferguson, & Gorur,2020) and particularly of the nature of the 'transduction' (Airey & Linder,Journal of Research in Science Teaching: The Official Journal of the National Association for Research in Science Teaching,46(1), 27-49,2009) or 're-description' (Lehrer & Schauble,2013) of one modal representation to another and their coordination in model-based reasoning in science. This paper explores ways in which groups of secondary students orchestrated multimodal representations to gain an understanding of the lever principle in a collaborative learning environment of a Science of Learning Research Classroom. The analysis of video data and student artefacts suggests that mathematical formulations on their own were limited in allowing students to satisfactorily engage with science ideas and that a key feature of cross-modal translation is the flexibility in application of these ideas afforded by the different modes and understanding the nature of these interactions. Using a Peircean socio-semiotic approach (Peirce,1992,1998) and Pickering's notion of scientific research involving a 'mangle of practice' (Pickering,1995, p. 23), this paper argues that a robust understanding of the lever principle necessarily involves students coordinating a range of modal representations, including visual-spatial, manipulative, embodied and abstract mathematical drawing on the distinctive affordances each brings to learning. We also describe the way these representations push back on learners in unexpected ways.";;;;;;"Xu, Lihua/0000-0003-3292-1296; Ferguson, Joseph/0000-0002-0971-3256; Tytler, Russell/0000-0003-0161-7240";;;;;;;;;;;;;1571-0068;1573-1774;;;;AUG;2021;19;6;;;;;1167;1186;;10.1007/s10763-020-10102-9;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10763-020-10102-9;;JUL 2020;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000546517300001;View Full Record in Web of Science

We developed a discourse visualization tool, the Classroom Discourse Analyzer (CDA), to support teachers' reflections on classroom discourse in video-based PD workshops. Methods We used a randomized controlled trial with an embedded case study to examine the efficacy of a year-long video-based PD program using the CDA. Findings The 24 intervention teachers significantly increased their use of productive talk moves in mathematics classrooms relative to the 22 comparison teachers (Cohen'sd = 0.67 to 2.35,p<.05). Moreover, a linear mixed model analysis showed that 882 students of the intervention teachers had significantly higher mathematics achievement scores than the 625 comparison students (Cohen'sd= 0.24,p<.05). The case study showed that CDA's multiple representations of classroom discourse and interactive, process-oriented visualizations facilitated the teachers' navigation of classroom video data. Additionally, video and visualizations prompted the teachers to reflect on the data with their peers for evidence-based reasoning and discussion. Contribution This study demonstrates the efficacy of a video-based PD program for increasing classroom discourse and student learning. It also informs the design of visualizations to enrich video-based PD.;;;;;Chan, Carol/JBS-1978-2023;Chan, Kennedy Kam Ho/0000-0003-1063-2813;;;;;;;;;;;;;1050-8406;1532-7809;;;;OCT 19;2020;29;4-5;;;;;642;680;;10.1080/10508406.2020.1783269;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10508406.2020.1783269;;JUL 2020;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000550554900001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Participants were middle school band students at a large suburban middle school (N= 105). Using a pretest-posttest quasi-experimental design, participants were divided into control (n= 53) and experimental (n= 52) groups. Participants in the experimental group received 3 weeks of practice strategy instruction during ensemble warm-up time, and the control group continued with their typical warm-up routine. Pretest and posttest data included self-reported practice strategy lists (N= 105) and video of individual practice sessions (n= 20). Both self-reported and video data were coded and analyzed using descriptive statistics as well as pretest-posttest within-groups comparisons. Thirteen hours of video data were further analyzed using an observational measure of self-regulation. Analyses revealed that experimental group participants identified and utilized significantly more practice strategies following the instructional intervention. Posttest experimental group practice sessions also revealed a more mature approach to practicing, including more strategic behaviors, greater variety in musical objectives, and longer periods spent focused on short excerpts of music.

These trends made us curious to undertake an in-depth investigation of the different ways children and their teachers engage in mathematics in preschool classrooms today. Purpose/Focus of Study: In our video-ethnography study we explored the ways mathematics manifested itself in a Pre-K setting and how mathematics functioned in different ways throughout the school day. The question guiding our research was: Recognizing the context of current transition and readiness concerns in early childhood education, in what ways is mathematics manifested in the interactions of teachers and children in a Pre-K classroom? Setting: The study took place in a childcare center, accredited by the National Association for the Education of Young Children, in the United States. Participants: Participants in this study were four 4- to 5-year-old children and their teachers in an ethnically diverse classroom. Research Design: The study drew on a video-ethnographic method through semester-long observations and video-recordings in a Pre-K classroom. The analysis began with (a) labeling manifestations of mathematics in the video data through open coding, proceeded to (b) the examination and the categorization of the various manifestations of mathematics, was followed by (c) the identification of the key scenes which best represented each category, and ended with (d) the multimodal analysis of the key scenes. Findings: This research illustrated that formal mathematics teaching and learning contexts included the kinds of disciplinary and bodily control practices that have been evident in studies of children at the preschool level transitioning into school. The study demonstrated the ways that mathematics, with its authoritative and classificatory nature, became a disciplinary tool itself during the course of the day. Also evident were the ways in which all actors in the classroom drew on mathematics for problem-solving in real-life situations within a power/resistance dynamic. Conclusions/Recommendations: This research raises questions of how disciplinary practices might limit children's mathematics learning. The finding that mathematics was implicated in the practices of power dynamics among teachers and children and among children opens up possibilities for teachers to recognize how mathematics is being used informally and creatively by children. Teachers can then use this knowledge to build on young children's identities as powerful and competent mathematicians, using mathematics in problem solving during day-to-day interactions.;;;;;Calamak, Elif Karsli/AAB-4502-2021;Calamak, Elif Karsli/0000-0001-7280-994X;;;;;;;;;;;;;0161-4681;1467-9620;;;;SEP;2020;122;9;;;;;;;90304;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000595649100004;View Full Record in Web of Science

The central claim is that multimodal transcription can contribute to developments in discourse theory. A three-stage reflective heuristic is developed and used in the article to support meta-methodological discussion on different researchers' negotiations with the complexity of the video data. The focus is how the different researchers attended to modalities of meaning making (e.g. speech, learning artefacts, whiteboard notes, gestures, bodily actions) and appropriated, adapted and transformed their theoretical framework in order to construct the transcripts for each study. The three-stage heuristic is shown to facilitate transparency in analytic decision-making and is recommended for promoting much needed discussion on processes of data generation for discourse analysis that draws upon video recordings of action in situ.;;;;;;"Martin, Jenny/0000-0002-1460-4441; Xu, Lihua/0000-0003-3292-1296; Seah, Lay Hoon/0000-0001-9402-5134";;;;;;;;;;;;;0157-244X;1573-1898;;;;FEB;2021;51;1;;;SI;;187;207;;10.1007/s11165-020-09961-7;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11165-020-09961-7;;SEP 2020;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000571036200001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Yet, scant literature explores how toddlers enact and express understandings of care in their play with objects and others. This article identifies play situations where toddlers enact and express understandings, and co-author narratives, of care with teachers. Discussion focuses on video data from two studies that investigated infants', toddlers' and teachers' pedagogical relationships in New Zealand and Australian settings. Cultural-historical and co-authoring concepts supported analysis of toddlers' object-centred play and caring actions. Findings show that toddlers engage teachers in co-creating caring actions while enacting and expressing care with dolls. We argue that this collaborative, object-centred play enables toddlers to co-author meanings of, and identity as,the one-caring. Implications emphasize teachers' intentional role and joint-play actions in supporting toddlers' initiatives to co-author care play narratives and their identity asthe one-caring.;;;;;;Quinones, Gloria/0000-0002-0795-2210;;;;;;;;;;;;;0300-4430;1476-8275;;;;APR 26;2022;192;6;;;;;964;979;;10.1080/03004430.2020.1826465;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03004430.2020.1826465;;SEP 2020;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000574018400001;View Full Record in Web of Science

An ethnographic video study was conducted in the context of a mathematics unit (the transforming recess unit) wherein learners conducted surveys, summarized data, and voiced the changes they hoped to see in the elementary school playground. Findings demonstrate both empowering and disempowering ways of mobilizing data and graphs, which are intertwined with multi-layered identities. Interactions in the classroom were nested in macro-level geopolitical configuration of identities that influenced labeled learners' access to becoming agents of change who could voice their desired changes in school practices. Categorical and binary frameworks inscribed in mathematics curriculum served as a context for inheritance and reproduction of existing categories through student surveys and graphs.

However, research points to potential racial and socioeconomic disparities, or opportunity gaps, in this context. In this study, we use survey and video data from 106 staff across 30 out-of-school programs to examine how three features, staff, activities, and adult-child interactions, differ based on the racial and socioeconomic makeup of programs. We find that staff at programs serving children from low-income families on average have less experience and education. Also, programs serving children from African American and low-income families tend to offer more academic-focused activities. Finally, we found no differences in adult-child interaction quality across programs in the sample.

This is an exploratory study aimed at investigating the practice of inquiry-based teaching in schools that use a foreign language (English) in teaching science content. To address the issue, we conducted video observations of six teachers from four community secondary schools in Iringa municipality, Tanzania, for approximately 16 h. These six teachers and 18 students were interviewed after reviewing the clips. In our video study, we noted three major barriers to students' development of critical thinking skills-teachers' knowledge and beliefs regarding the nature of scientific knowledge, a classroom culture that does not support students' development of critical thinking skills and the use of the language of instruction that is not well mastered by both teachers and students.;;;;;Mkimbili, Selina/AID-5564-2022;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1871-1502;1871-1510;;;;DEC;2020;15;4;;;;;1121;1142;;10.1007/s11422-020-09973-9;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11422-020-09973-9;;OCT 2020;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000583094900001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Few will disagree that the potential for word and narrative comprehension increases when children's prior knowledge is activated and when children's focus is fully on the reading session. Despite this, little is known about the potential for establishment of joint attention and activation of prior knowledge in an early childhood education and care setting and how early childhood educators prepare young children to participate in shared book reading sessions before formal reading starts. Based on video data of teachers (N = 12) and small groups of children (N = 72) reading picture books and picture book apps in kindergarten, we sought to shed light on what behaviors occur before reading starts. The analyses were conducted in two phases. The first phase was based on 48 videotaped readings and followed a descriptive quantitative approach to investigate early childhood teachers' time use before the reading session, with readings of both print books and picture book apps. The second phase was based on two app readings in which the pre-reading phases stood out for their long duration. A qualitative analytical approach was applied to describe the teacher-child behavior, establishment of joint attention, and activation of prior knowledge during the two specific pre-reading events. Even though the sample is small, we find clear examples of pre-reading strategies specific to app readings. In this study, we discuss teachers' strategies to promote joint attention and activation of prior knowledge in new ways and how teachers exploit the pre-reading phase, for instance taking advantage of the books paratext, while adapting to the medium. Nevertheless, there remains a knowledge gap concerning app readings with short or no pre-reading phases.;;;;;;Stangeland, Elisabeth/0000-0001-8359-5588;;;;;;;;;;;;;1664-1078;;;;;NOV 12;2020;11;;;;;;;;570652;10.3389/fpsyg.2020.570652;http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.570652;;;;;;;;33281672;;;;;WOS:000592460100001;View Full Record in Web of Science

The focal pedagogical intervention utilized mobile augmented reality (AR) activities, the development of which was inspired by research on learning 'in the wild.' Applying the principle of reverse engineering, we introduce a pedagogical approach termed 'rewilding' for its emphasis on designing supportive conditions for goal-directed interaction outside of classrooms. Three instances of AR materials use are presented from an out-of-class activity associated with university-level language courses involving a quest-type AR game called ChronoOps. Video data of 3-player groups were transcribed using conventions from multimodal conversation analysis. The empirical investigation illustrates meaning making through visible embodied displays, the performance of new actions through incorporation of public semiotic resources, and the contributions of the material surround as actants in the flow of interaction. Analysis illustrates that mobile AR activities enable languaging events among assemblages of environments, mobile devices, and embodied experience. We conclude by outlining the affordances of mobile AR activities as one example of rewilding approaches to creating material conditions for language use and learning.;;;;;;"Jakonen, Teppo/0000-0002-7250-0042; Thorne, Steven L/0000-0002-6552-955X";;;;;;;;;;;;;0026-7902;1540-4781;;;;JAN;2021;105;;;1;;;106;125;;10.1111/modl.12687;http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/modl.12687;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000627316900006;View Full Record in Web of Science

The sequence involved students generating and representing measures of their teacher's arm-span, with a focus on the invention and refinement of data representations characteristic of STEM epistemic practices. We undertook a micro-ethnographic practical epistemology analysis of video data of classroom and group discussions and student work, to explore the teaching and learning processes driving students' understandings of data variation and measures of central tendency. Through this analysis we appreciated aesthetic experiences as fundamental for students' growing epistemic and conceptual understandings and the teacher's pedagogical practices. We draw on the pragmatist aesthetic perspectives of Dewey and Peirce to show how students' sign-making shifted from an everyday interest in the arm span measuring process to an interest in the potentialities of the data set as an exploratory field. We consider this a shift from an everyday 'art' aesthetic to a 'mathematics' disciplinary aesthetic. We argue that such an aesthetic perspective, in which feeling and meaning are intertwined, provides a powerful way to understand the role of affect in learning.;;;;;White, Peta J/A-2273-2019;"White, Peta J/0000-0002-0225-5934; Tytler, Russell/0000-0003-0161-7240; Ferguson, Joseph/0000-0002-0971-3256";;;;;;;;;;;;;0950-0693;1464-5289;;;;MAR 24;2022;44;5;;;SI;;753;774;;10.1080/09500693.2021.1875514;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09500693.2021.1875514;;JAN 2021;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000612449800001;View Full Record in Web of Science

From the video data, which allowed for an emic analysis of the students' vocal and non-vocal actions when engaging in the different task types, it was found that in both the structured and unstructured task interactions, because the students were mainly focused on task completion, there were frequent minimal turns and sequences. A deviant case analysis revealed that the participants prioritized task completion as the focus of activities even when engaging in social talk by evoking various types of roles (e.g. students, friends). The study proposes several pedagogical suggestions for employing tasks in lower-level EFL contexts.;;;;;;Park, Yujong/0000-0003-2607-0958;;;;;;;;;;;;;1362-1688;1477-0954;;;;2021 FEB 2;2021;;;;;;;;;1,36217E+15;10.1177/1362168820987957;http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1362168820987957;;FEB 2021;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000618463300001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Instead, schools should be inviting and exciting places to learn but also nurturing spaces where all students feel they belong. Drawing upon expanded definition of literacies that include play and making, this study examines how the maker literacies-media production where multimodal, digital, and artifact-based literacies converge-creates opportunities for youth to critically engage their favorite toys and media in school. While the preponderance of research on media literacy has focused on critical consumption of multimedia, research on play-based literacies has focused largely on early childhood (K-2) spaces. This article examines student engagement in the intersection of critical media production and play-based literacies for older youth, specifically play, toymaking, and filmmaking in classroom makerspaces. Purpose: The goal of the ongoing Literacy Playshop studies is to explore the meaning-making and participation that youth experience through production-oriented maker literacies (e.g., toy(re)making, filmmaking) in P-12 settings. Maker literacies enable students to critically respond to pervasive stereotypes in popular media by producing their own films by toyhacking or remaking physical features of toys that also enable revised character identities and alternative storylines. The research within this article aimed to understand how preservice and in-service teachers approach play-based media production as a participatory literacy for students in classroom makerspaces. Research Design: Using mediated discourse analysis, toy remaking and filmmaking is examined to unpack the tangles of meanings, bodies, and toys in the action texts and imaginary contexts of play. Researchers looked across three sites, including a third-grade classroom, a literacy methods course for preservice elementary teachers, and a methods course for secondary English/Language Arts preservice teachers, all of which implemented a curricular framework for play-based makerspaces. Using ethnographic methods, multimodal video analysis, and mediated discourse analysis, researchers compared critical media literacy strategies in these three sites. Data sources included: video data of students' toyhacking, hacked toys, student-created films centering toys, researcher fieldnotes, written reflections of preservice teachers, and interviews with the in-service teacher. Findings: Findings suggest student engagement was significantly increased through the collaborative digital film process, which often gave preservice and inservice teachers the chance to expand their conception of literacy. Teaching children and preservice teachers to engage in play-based literacies allowed participants to more actively participate in their own education, assisting them in creating their own media, responding critically, productively, and multimodally to a world filled with popular animated films, television, video games, and digital media texts. Conclusions: Overall, findings align with calls to reconceptualize and update literacy curricula across K-12 and teacher education programs to center student meaning-making, agency, and critical response. More research is needed to understand the intersections of participatory literacies, mass media, critical literacy, and social justice.;;;;;Wohlwend, Karen/AFK-8529-2022;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0161-4681;1467-9620;;;;MAR;2021;123;3;;;;;;;30309;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000765497000006;View Full Record in Web of Science
J;Powell, CW;;;;Powell, Christy Wessel;;;Show, Don't Tell: Multimodal Story Feedback in a K-1 Play-Based Writing Unit;TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD;;;;;;;;;;;;Background: With standardization ever squeezing creative curricula in K-1 classrooms, creating time for a play-based multimodal writing curriculum that leverages children's strengths as storytellers is revolutionary. Due in part to accountability policy pressures, print-based writing and verbocentric writing feedback are still often privileged in school curricula. And yet, children are natural whole-body storytellers who will be asked to write and present ideas in all sorts of forms. In order to leverage children's storytelling strengths, we need to teach writing through multiple modes: This means expanding both writing instruction and the types of feedback offered to writers in primary classrooms. Research Questions: This study examines two questions: How is feedback being given, and what impact does it have on children's storytelling? How is play/storying being sanctioned? Setting & Participants: The study took place in a K-1 classroom in an inquiry-based, project-based school in the U.S. Midwest during a month-long storytelling workshop unit. Participants included two co-teachers and 46 children aged 5 to 7. Research Design: This qualitative study used ethnographic methods and participant observation. Data Collection & Analysis: Video data were collected during workshop each day for one month, including minilessons, writing time, and share time, which is the focus of this article. Discourse analysis and a multimodality theoretical lens were used to analyze how children gave one another feedback on their stories through embodied demonstration, gesture, acting, out, or copying one another's storytelling devices. Findings: Findings indicate that children's acting/embodiment, humor/parody, and copying all worked as effective forms of multimodal feedback, which ultimately functioned as teaching for developing peers' storytelling strategies and skills. However, teachers inadvertently privileged language alone via narration, or language with demonstration in feedback sessions. Conclusions: Teacher/researcher collaborations should explore ways to reimagine forms of writer's feedback that include and account for demonstration, copying, and impromptu performance and that, ultimately, open up the definition of what counts as writing at school.

Swiss policy stipulates two distinct models for TAs working in mainstream classes: they can either be employed to work with a particular pupil with special educational needs (SEN) or be employed as a general aide to provide support for the whole class. This article describes a study investigating teachers' and TAs' interactions with pupils during individual seatwork based on observational video data and examining how these reflect the roles foreseen for TAs. The analysis is based on videos of 90 minutes in each of the 31 primary school classes with TA and teacher being present. Results of the video analysis of individual seatwork demonstrate that TAs interact longer with pupils with SEN and pupils with lower attainment levels than teachers do. The analysis of the content of instructional support reveals that TAs often use transmissive approaches, i.e. telling a pupil how to tackle a task or even provide the correct answer, whereas co-constructive support, such as scaffolding, is less prevalent. The findings are discussed regarding their relevance for policy and the development of practice.;;;;;Vogt, Franziska/R-1427-2016;Vogt, Franziska/0000-0002-2023-0431;;;;;;;;;;;;;0885-6257;1469-591X;;;;MAR 15;2021;36;2;;;SI;;215;230;;10.1080/08856257.2021.1901373;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08856257.2021.1901373;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000641754000005;View Full Record in Web of Science
J;Sindoni, MG;;;;Sindoni, Maria Grazia;;;Mode-switching in video-mediated interaction: Integrating linguistic phenomena into multimodal transcription tasks;LINGUISTICS AND EDUCATION;;;;;;;;;;;;Digital environments have shaped unprecedented configurations of spontaneous interactions (Herring, 2013), thus giving rise to emergent patterns of language variation. The borders between spoken and written language have been blurred by the interplay of semiotic resources and medium affordances (Kress & van Leeuwen, 2001), and to the point that traditional ideas about spoken/written variation-with related implications in language teaching/learning-have been challenged. An example of language variation has been labelled mode-switching (which paraphrases code-switching, cf. Heller (1988), and draws on Halliday's register component of mode, 1978) that describes the alternation of speech and writing in the same communicative event in video-mediated communication (Sindoni, 2013, 2014a, 2019b). Previous findings show that mode-switching is mainly used to manage the flow of conversation and for self-repair in multi-party interactions, whereas patterns and use of mode-switching are still unmapped in one-to-one interactions. Drawing on a corpus of multimodal data (i.e. 48 Skype video-calls involving peer interaction between postgraduate students and friends and/or relatives), examples of mode-switching will be presented in one-to-one interactions by expanding on conversation analysis theories (Sacks, Schegloff, & Jefferson, 1974). Assuming that mode-switching is not used to hold the floor in one-to-one contexts, other creative uses will be documented, for example with reference to medium affordances, speakers' interpersonal attitudes, and interplay with other semiotic resources (e.g. layout, visuals, etc.). Discussion of data will include excerpts of multimodal transcription of video-mediated interactions produced by students to highlight how transcription can be pedagogical and helpful in understanding how students heuristically make sense of these video-mediated events and establish priorities in their reconstructions of video data. In conclusion, the productivity of these patterns in spontaneous video-mediated communication calls for a systematic theoretical reflection and subsequent incorporation in teacher training, syllabus design, and institutional learning contexts.

Two versions of a mobile-based game about marine fishery management were created. Participants were 105 seventh-grade students in Taiwan. Research instruments included a Science Game Engagement questionnaire and a Marine Ecosystem and Sustainability Test. Students' interviews and classroom videos were also collected. Students' models of engagement were analyzed by using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling, and comparisons of subscales of engagement and learning outcomes were made by Analysis of Covariance statistics. The results showed that the students in the MPSG group had a higher level of behavioral engagement and better learning achievement than the students in the SPSG group did. Also, in exploring the interrelationships among the subscales of students' engagement, we found that, in the SPSG group, students' behavioral engagement was positively predicted by their emotional engagement, while in the MPSG group, it was positively predicted by their social engagement. In both groups, behavioral engagement predicted cognitive engagement. This finding was supported by the video data in that more interactions among the group members were observed in the MPSG group. This indicated that the multi-agent, dynamic modeling in the MPSG may have shifted the quality of the learners' social interactions. The affordances of participatory simulated games are discussed, and future research directions are provided. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Participatory simulations allow users to participate in simulations by controlling one of the roles in the system which models real-life settings. Dynamic modeling is an essential feature of participatory simulations that allows the learners to see the exact impact of their participation on changes in the system. Students who learned with the participatory simulations showed significantly better reasoning in concept building and fewer misconceptions than with conventional simulations. However learners can overly emphasize racing to win in multi-agent participatory simulations and tasks in participatory simulations can be too challenging for some learners. What this paper adds We compared students' engagement models in two versions of a participatory game-a multi-team participatory simulated game (MPSG) and a single-team participatory simulated game (SPSG). We found that in the MPSG social engagement predicted behavioral engagement while in the SPSG students' emotional engagement played an important role. Students who participated in the MPSG had better performance in system thinking than the students in the SPSG. Implications for practice and/or policy Dynamic modeling is not only authentic for simulating certain scientific phenomena but also it offers the affordances of improving the quality of learners' social interactions. This should be taken into account in the future design of educational simulations. A multi-team design of participatory simulation taking advantage of competition among teams and collaboration within teams can help students to learn complex phenomena.;;;;;Liang, Jyh-Chong/IZQ-3734-2023;"Liang, Jyh-Chong/0000-0002-2423-5950; Lee, Silvia Wen-Yu/0000-0001-6111-2055";;;;;;;;;;;;;0007-1013;1467-8535;;;;MAY;2021;52;3;;;;;1197;1214;;10.1111/bjet.13067;http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bjet.13067;;MAR 2021;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000630967900001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Similarly, sociopolitical development (SPD) is the process of developing a critical understanding, skill set, and emotional depth to enact individual agency against oppressive forces. Of the latter, SPD is vital in empowering youth from traditionally marginalized communities to challenge inequities. However, SPD has largely remained absent from U.S. classrooms. Purpose/Objective/ Research Question/Focus of Study: Considering the absence of SPD in U.S. classrooms, this case study explores the SPD of Black female preservice teachers and their Black female high school mentees in a two-year tutoring and mentoring school-based program. Our study captures the woke pedagogical experiences that advanced participants' co-constructed CC. As such, we seek to describe student exemplars of what it means to be awakened and stay woke through an analysis of interviews, journal reflections, and video data. To this end, the research question that guided this study was: What are the perspectives of Black female youth as they co-construct CC toward SPD in a two-year tutoring and mentoring school-based program? Research Design: Through the lenses of critical race feminism and woke pedagogies, this study used a single case study design. Case study is appropriate for this study because it highlights the particularity and complexities of one unit of analysis. Findings: Our findings capture the perspectives of Black female youth as they cultivate CC toward sociopolitical development in one educational initiative geared toward partnering undergraduate and high school students. An examination of data through the lens of critical race feminism and woke pedagogies spotlighted the perspectives of our participants as they co-constructed CC through woke pedagogical experiences. Mentors deepened their CC on race, and mentees gained heightened awareness of gendered and racialized school procedures and policies. Black girls in this study woke up (CC) and stayed woke through their activism (SPD). Conclusions: In sharing the perspectives of Black female youth as they cultivated SPD, it is our intention that the critical approach and experiences that we have described capture the methods and strategies that one educational initiative implemented to empower and promote agency among Black female students. As an example of woke pedagogy, this educational initiative offered Black girls at the intersection of race, gender, and class an opportunity to critically question their world and become aware of racial and social injustices impacting their everyday lives and community.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0161-4681;1467-9620;;;;APR;2021;123;13;;;;;;;130304;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000765503000005;View Full Record in Web of Science

P.";;;Visual and Statistical Methods to Calculate Intercoder Reliability for Time-Resolved Observational Research;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUALITATIVE METHODS;;;;;;;;;;;;While calculating intercoder reliability (ICR) is straightforward for text-based data, such as for interview transcript excerpts, determining ICR for naturalistic observational video data is much more complex. To date, there have been few methods proposed in literature that are robust enough to handle complexities such as the occurrence of simultaneous event complexity and partial agreement by the raters. This is especially important with the emergence of high-resolution video data, which collects nearly continuous or continuous observational data in naturalistic settings. In this paper, we present three approaches to calculating ICR. First, we present the technical approach to clean and compare two coders' results such that traditional metrics of ICR (e.g., Cohen's kappa, Krippendorff's alpha, Scott's pi) can be calculated, methods previously unarticulated in literature. However, these calculations are intensive, requiring significant data manipulation. As an alternative, this paper also proposes two novel methods to calculate ICR by algorithmically comparing visual representations of each coders' results. To demonstrate efficacy of the approaches, we employ all three methods on data from two separate ongoing research contexts using observational data. We find that the visual methods perform as well as the traditional measures of ICR and offer significant reduction in the work required to calculate ICR, with an added advantage of allowing the researcher to set thresholds for acceptable agreement in lag time. These methods may transform the consideration of ICR in other studies across disciplines that employ observational data.;;;;;;"Berdanier, Catherine/0000-0003-3271-4836; Buswell, Natascha/0000-0001-8503-5787";;;;;;;;;;;;;1609-4069;;;;;APR 9;2021;20;;;;;;;;1,60941E+16;10.1177/16094069211002418;http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/16094069211002418;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000639879300001;View Full Record in Web of Science

It examines reuse through the lens of the invisibilities experienced by educational researchers who perform secondary analysis on video records of practice. Drawing on 22 in-depth interviews with educational researchers, we examine how they conceptualize secondary analysis of qualitative video data and cope with invisibilities in the data. For example, knowing the original research question was not sufficient: reusers needed to understand more about the intentionality of the data producer. They also sought more information on the reflexivity of the original researcher and how this influenced data production. Additionally, reusers discussed the creation of evidence from the video during secondary analysis as teaching and learning themselves entail invisible processes.;;;;;Frank, Rebecca D/ABH-3774-2020;"Frank, Rebecca D/0000-0003-2064-5140; Yakel, Elizabeth/0000-0002-8792-6900";;;;;;;;;;;;;1468-7941;1741-3109;;;;DEC;2022;22;6;;;;;951;968;1,46879E+16;10.1177/14687941211005955;http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/14687941211005955;;APR 2021;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000643484000001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Researchers conducted a professional development session on ratio LTs, which included analyzing 3 years of district-level data from Math-Mapper 6-8, a digital LT-based diagnostic assessment application, with fifteen 6th and 7th grade teachers. Teachers subsequently conducted a lesson study to enact what they had learned, allowing researchers to study how teachers used data on student progress along ratio equivalence LTs to design, implement, and evaluate the lesson study. Researchers applied a framework for LT-based data-driven decision making to analyze video data of the lesson study activities. Teachers successfully scanned data reports to pinpoint the LT levels at which to target modified instruction. In one instance, they focused too narrowly on a single item resulting in excessive lesson time on tasks on graph literacy external to the LT. In the other, their data interpretation was overly general and resulted in the design and implementation of a sequence of tasks that reversed the order implied in the LT and relied on the use of more sophisticated strategies from subsequent LTs. Results suggest a need for more data interpretation skills, a deep understanding of the learning theory underpinning LTs, and more precision in teacher discourse around LTs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1863-9690;1863-9704;;;;NOV;2021;53;6;;;SI;;1265;1283;;10.1007/s11858-021-01259-w;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11858-021-01259-w;;APR 2021;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000640722100001;View Full Record in Web of Science

In making the puppets and using them as part of a 'theatre in a suitcase' performance at Melbourne Zoo, students were expected to integrate both scientific and artistic goals to demonstrate knowledge of specific endangered species. In this process, students needed to learn how their more immediate, everyday positive and negative aesthetic responses could be made continuous with a scientific aesthetic to produce both a coherent puppet and an advocacy performance. Through micro-ethnographic practical epistemology analysis of video data of this session, we demonstrate how this mix of everyday and subject-specific aesthetic responses, judgements and intentions interacted to shape and promote students' learning in science. In addressing this multimodal and multi-purpose task, students learnt and applied science knowledge to a real-world issue of species endangerment.;;;;;;"Tytler, Russell/0000-0003-0161-7240; Ferguson, Joseph/0000-0002-0971-3256; Hannigan, Shelley/0000-0002-3232-5761; Wickman, Per-Olof/0000-0002-3700-7340";;;;;;;;;;;;;0950-0693;1464-5289;;;;MAR 24;2022;44;5;;;SI;;797;814;;10.1080/09500693.2021.1909773;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09500693.2021.1909773;;APR 2021;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000648792500001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Learning management systems (LMS) provide additional sources of objective data that can evaluate student performance. This study compared dental students' self-report of course video viewing with LMS data. Methods Dental students in a 2018 flipped pediatric dentistry course were given a questionnaire after course completion that captured self-reported course video viewing. Student data and time spent on videos were extracted from the LMS and matched to the questionnaire. McNemar's test evaluated differences between self-reported and matching LMS data. Results Of the 109 enrolled students, 99 (91%) completed the questionnaire. Most students self-reported that they watched more than half of the videos (71%), re-watched at least once (89%), and watched at times other than 8 a.m.-5 p.m. (80%). Of the 104 students with data from the LMS, 40% of students watched more than half of the videos, 49% re-watched at least one video, and 60% watched between 8 a.m.-5 p.m. LMS data showed 14 (13%) students did not watch any videos. Significant differences were found between self-reported video viewing and matched LMS video data in (1) percentage of videos watched, (2) number of times videos were re-watched, and (3) most frequent time for watching the videos (p < 0.001 for all).

J;"Prediger, S; Buro, R";;;;"Prediger, Susanne; Buro, Raffaele";;;Fifty ways to work with students' diverse abilities? A video study on inclusive teaching practices in secondary mathematics classrooms;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INCLUSIVE EDUCATION;;;;;;;;;;;;Inclusive teaching practices can be characterized as recurrent ways how teachers work with their students' diverse abilities, but how exactly are they enacted in subject matter classrooms? The paper proposes a conceptual framework to unpack inclusive practices according to the student ability to which they refer, in five typical jobs for teachers: (a) identifying the demands for the ability, (b) differentiating learning goals, (c) compensating for low abilities, (d) enhancing abilities, and (e) addressing the abilities in joint learning. The proposed job-ability framework for inclusive teaching practices is substantiated in a video study of 25 mathematics lessons on percentages with the same curriculum material. In total, rather than 50, 133 different inclusive teaching practices were identified in 3862 sequences and structured into 20 cells. They address four abilities (from most often to least often): (1) selective attention/working memory, (2) mathematical pre-knowledge, (3) language proficiency, and (4) metacognitive regulation. The large variance of enacted practices identified within and between lessons calls for professional development that elicits, leverages, and extends the repertoire of practices. While the reported frequencies are specific to the chosen teaching unit, the job-ability framework can be transferred to other subject-matter classrooms and used in professional development programs.;;;;;Prediger, Susanne/AAB-8356-2020;Prediger, Susanne/0000-0001-6541-259X;;;;;;;;;;;;;1360-3116;1464-5173;;;;2021 MAY 12;2021;;;;;;;;;;10.1080/13603116.2021.1925361;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13603116.2021.1925361;;MAY 2021;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000649622000001;View Full Record in Web of Science
J;Johora, FT;;;;Johora, Fatema Taj;;;The preschool teacher's assumptions about a child's ability or disability: finding a pedagogical password for inclusion;EARLY YEARS;;;;;;;;;;;;The advancement of inclusive education policies worldwide has given greater weight to social justice practices in educational settings. However, inclusion in preschools has received less attention from researchers. This article examines a 4-year-old child's participation in a mainstream preschool in Australia from a cultural-historical perspective. In particular, this study used the concept of secondary disability to analyse the data, and in this process identified a contradiction between the teacher's perceptions of the child's abilities and the teacher's reported understanding of the parent's perceptions of the child's abilities, which 'clouded' the child's position within the preschool setting. Eight hours of video data were gathered across eight months. The findings indicate that understanding the child's personality and potential can operate as a 'pedagogical password' for the teacher to enter on to the child's unique developmental trajectory. This paper argues that identifying the unique developmental pathway of the child is essential to reduce secondary disabilities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0957-5146;1472-4421;;;;JAN 1;2023;43;1;;;;;197;212;;10.1080/09575146.2021.1922991;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09575146.2021.1922991;;MAY 2021;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000651272700001;View Full Record in Web of Science
J;"Puskas, T; Andersson, A";;;;"Puskas, Tunde; Andersson, Anita";;;Preschool teachers as keepers of traditions and agents of change;EARLY YEARS;;;;;;;;;;;;According to the Swedish Preschool Curriculum, one of the tasks of the preschool is to pass on a cultural heritage, its values, traditions and history, language and knowledge, from one generation to the next. The formulation indicates that cultural heritage plays an important role in defining the tasks of preschool teachers as far as the transmission of cultural norms is concerned. The aim of the overall study was to explore how Swedish preschool teachers implement and reflect on the task of transmitting a cultural heritage. This paper has its focus on how a particular cultural tradition, Easter, is celebrated in two preschools. The empirical data consists of 227 min video data from two preschools. The video data were analysed through qualitative content analysis with a focus on how different semiotic resources, actions and artefacts are used to perform Easter. The different modes of enacting traditions are used as instruments of socialisation into a cultural heritage as well as means of actualisation of a preschool pedagogy. While preschool teachers can be seen as agents of change who challenge some of the ways of celebrating a tradition, they are also agents of national reproduction. Thus, the teachers both enact the curriculum and build a bricolage of elements, some of which represent continuity, while others represent change.;;;;;Puskás, Tünde/B-4080-2017;Puskás, Tünde/0000-0003-3449-2384;;;;;;;;;;;;;0957-5146;1472-4421;;;;MAY 27;2021;41;2-3;;;;;190;201;;10.1080/09575146.2018.1515892;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09575146.2018.1515892;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000673004100007;View Full Record in Web of Science

As most previous literature has studied feedback provided on homework or video prompts, how teachers provide such feedback in the classroom is poorly understood. Here, sixteen lessons taught by five teachers were purposefully sampled from a larger video study (172 lessons) as lessons with high-quality feedback according to a standardized observation instrument. The analysis focused on the instructional situations in which teachers provided feedback. When teachers provided procedural feedback, the situations were orderly and effective. Feedback on conceptual understanding and mathematical practices was provided in situations when students were especially challenged, and entailed a series of complex decisions, thereby placing demands on the teachers to manage both the students' understanding and behavior. We argue that researchers should focus on how teachers and students negotiate the instructional situation to allow for feedback on conceptual understanding or mathematical practices.;;;;;;Stovner, Roar Bakken/0000-0003-3106-3875;;;;;;;;;;;;;0013-1954;1573-0816;;;;NOV;2021;108;3;;;;;533;551;;10.1007/s10649-021-10065-w;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10649-021-10065-w;;JUN 2021;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000658121800002;View Full Record in Web of Science

The participants (N = 20) were teacher education students whose collaborative learning was supported with a designed regulation macro script during a six-week mathematics course. The purpose of the script was to provide structured phases during the collaborative learning tasks for the group members to plan, monitor, and evaluate their workings. The video data of groups' face-to-face work was collected and analysed by focusing on the different types of challenges the groups experienced and the types of challenges they described during the scripted interaction. The results indicate that the groups experienced more socio-cognitive challenges than socio-emotional challenges. The script provided them a moment to verbalize their emotional experiences, name the emotions (i.e. frustration), and attribute the challenges and emotions more precisely than during their mathematical task. The intertwining characteristics of socio-cognitive and socio-emotional challenges were observable. Collaborative learning can be challenging for groups, and thus, the knowledge of and the ability to implement practices for becoming aware of challenges can provide a direction for students to progress towards more productive collaboration.;;;;;Järvelä, Sanna M/B-4267-2013;Naykki, Piia/0000-0002-2931-704X;;;;;;;;;;;;;2210-6561;2210-657X;;;;SEP;2021;30;;A;;;;;;100536;10.1016/j.lcsi.2021.100536;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lcsi.2021.100536;;JUN 2021;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000688527300008;View Full Record in Web of Science

A collaborative peer mentoring professional development case study utilising observational video data from a series of lessons examined how teacher feedback knowledge and beliefs are articulated and developed in pedagogical practices, and the tensions that arise in giving learning enhancing feedback in an active learning setting. The high level of teacher feedback knowledge and positively aligned beliefs was found to be contradictory to the feedback practices used in the classroom. The analysis showed that consistent provision of learning to enhance types of feedback was constrained due to environmental and pedagogical tensions. Predominantly, verbal, non-specific, positively oriented feedback was shown to be temporally situated, with tensions arising from the multiple purposes it serves, including classroom management and relationship building. Furthermore, despite the merits of a localised, situated professional development approach, teacher behavioural change proved complex to achieve. This study concluded some types of feedback not characterised as 'learning enhancing' can offer educational benefits and should not be dismissed.;;;;;;Singh, Kuki/0000-0002-0745-7041;;;;;;;;;;;;;1354-0602;1470-1278;;;;MAY 19;2021;27;1-4;;;;;95;115;;10.1080/13540602.2021.1933415;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13540602.2021.1933415;;JUN 2021;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000665714300001;View Full Record in Web of Science

While these technologies can be used to create learning experiences tailored to an individual student, they cannot address students' affect accurately and quickly during the learning process. This paper focuses on two core research questions. How do students regulate affect and what are the processes that affect regulation? First, this paper reviews the affect regulation methods and processes in an intelligent learning environment based on affective transition and affect compensation. This process, along with affect analysis, affect regulation, intelligent agents, and an intervention strategy can be used to analyze specific affect regulation methods and improve the affective regulation system. Seventy-two 7th grade students were randomly placed into an experimental condition that used Betty's Brain, an intelligent tutoring system (ITS), or a classroom control. A lag sequence analysis and a multinomial processing tree analysis of video data captured at 25-minute intervals revealed significant differences in affect transitions frequencies between the two groups. Based on the results of the above analyses and after-class interviews, we found that Betty's Brain was able to promote effective affect-regulation strategies to students in the domain of forest ecosystems.;;;;;Wang, Lijia/GVT-3221-2022;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1176-3647;1436-4522;;;;JUL;2021;24;3;;;;;194;209;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000669522300014;View Full Record in Web of Science

This is particularly salient in the disciplines of both history and data science. Our approach to helping students build expertise with complex information leverages activity theory to think about the design of a classroom activity system integrated with the design of a collaborative open-source network-analysis software tool called Net.Create. Through analysis of network log data as well as video data of students' collaborative interactions with Net.Create, we explore how our activity system helped students reconcile common contradictions that create barriers to dealing with complex datasets in large lecture classrooms. Findings show that as students draw on details in a historical text to collaboratively construct a larger network, they begin to move more readily between small detail and aggregate overview. Students at both high and low initial skill levels were able to increase the complexity of their historical analyses through their engagement with the Net.Create tool and activities. Net.Create transforms the limitation of large class sizes in history classrooms into a resource for students' collaborative knowledge building, and through collaborative data entry it supports the historiographic practices of citation and revision and helps students embed local historical actors into a larger historical context.;;;;;"Danish, Joshua A/E-8960-2010; McCranie, Ann/HLH-3536-2023";"Danish, Joshua A/0000-0001-5119-5897; McCranie, Ann/0000-0002-0515-7184; Craig, Kalani/0000-0002-8909-0369; Humburg, Megan/0000-0003-0638-7616";;;;;;;;;;;;;1556-1607;1556-1615;;;;JUN;2021;16;2;;;;;185;223;;10.1007/s11412-021-09343-9;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11412-021-09343-9;;JUL 2021;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000671506000001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Therefore, teacher preparation has placed sufficient emphasis on the development of student teachers' professional vision in the context of inclusive education. In this study, professional vision refers to student teachers ability to notice and reason about classroom events that are crucial for effective inclusive teaching. This study explores student teachers' professional vision of two dimensions of effective inclusive classrooms (i.e. teacher-student interactions (TSI) and differentiated instruction (DI)) by examining different profiles of professional vision and its relation with student teachers' professional beliefs about diversity and self-efficacy in implementing inclusive practices. Data was collected in a sample of 1397 student teachers in Flemish primary teacher education institutions (N = 8). Student teachers' professional vision was assessed by a standardised video-based comparative judgement instrument, while student teachers' beliefs and self-efficacy were measured by survey scales. Survey and video data were combined through cluster analysis and regression analysis. Findings indicate three different profiles of professional vision among student teachers. Differences between student teachers' professional vision profiles is explained by their self-efficacy. However, the results of the cluster analyses did not produce a group of student teachers with high abilities in both noticing and reasoning about TSI and DI. This implies that teacher education programmes need to more adequately train student teachers for inclusive education. Recommendations for teacher education programmes on inclusive primary education are given.;;;;;;Vanderlinde, Ruben/0000-0002-4912-3410;;;;;;;;;;;;;1360-3116;1464-5173;;;;JUL 29;2021;25;9;;;;;1091;1107;;10.1080/13603116.2019.1597186;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13603116.2019.1597186;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000658887600007;View Full Record in Web of Science

Pedagogy research may benefit from incorporating research methods that can investigate teachers' and pupils' interpretations. Purpose: this research expands the Pedagogy Analysis Framework (Riordan, 2020) by explaining in detail the meso-strategies (tactics) and a macro-strategy (grand strategy) used by participants in three school science lessons about chromatography. The research design builds on previous work by using full lessons and introducing pupil group verbal protocols. In addition, Pedagogy Analysis Notation is introduced to help understand and explain macro-strategic behaviours. Sample: one class of thirty 13-year-old pupils and one science teacher. Design and method: four research methods were used (lesson video analysis, teacher verbal protocols, pupil group verbal protocols and researcher group interviews). Data were video recorded (managed using NVivo). Fourteen hours of video data were analysed using Grounded Theory Methods by two educational researchers and the class teacher. The interpretivist theoretical perspective (symbolic interactionism) was underpinned by a social constructionist epistemology (hence the methodology is Straussian Grounded Theory). Appropriate criteria for evaluating the emergent grounded theory were used. Data were recorded in 2017. Results: the Pedagogy Analysis Framework uses the concepts: means (human and non-human), strategy (a spectrum from micro-strategies (actions), through meso-strategies (tactics) to macro-strategies (grand strategies)), ends (regarding the self, another person or a thing, or a group of people or things), and accidents. Types of tactics identified in these data were: inform (misinform and disinform), question, instruct, use space/time, repeat, train, assess, and interact. Pedagogy Analysis Notation is used to understand and explain 'the stationary [sic] cupboard' incident. Conclusion: the extended Pedagogy Analysis Framework, combined with the Pedagogy Analysis Notation, improves strategic dialogue between teachers, pupils and educational researchers. This research design facilitates comparison of interpretations of classroom pedagogy by a teacher, pupils and two researchers.;;;;;Riordan, John-Paul/GWZ-4083-2022;Riordan, John-Paul/0000-0001-9016-5578;;;;;;;;;;;;;0263-5143;1470-1138;;;;JUL 3;2023;41;3;;;;;906;927;;10.1080/02635143.2021.1972960;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02635143.2021.1972960;;AUG 2021;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000690829700001;View Full Record in Web of Science

The epistemological commitments of modes are affordances that cannot be avoided. This article investigates how the epistemological commitments of modes affect possibilities for learning. Video data was collected from a learning activity where upper secondary students drew and explained an experiment representing the greenhouse effect. The analysis uses the variation theory of learning, which assumes that students learn when they notice new aspects of objects of learning by experiencing variation against an invariant background. Such variation can be created through the representations used. Findings show that, in the learning activity, variation was created in a range of modes. Some of the variation, particularly with regards to radiation, was due to the epistemological commitments of drawing. However, these aspects of radiation went unnoticed by the students, possibly because several aspects varied simultaneously. The teacher then helped the students to become aware of certain variation. Implications for the teaching and learning of science when taking the epistemological commitment of different modes into consideration include both challenges, such as when unintended variation is created, and opportunities, such as when spontaneously occurring variation can be taken up for discussion.;;;;;;Fredlund, Tobias/0000-0003-0303-3660;;;;;;;;;;;;;1470-3572;1741-3214;;;;2021 SEP 15;2021;;;;;;;;;1,47036E+16;10.1177/14703572211038991;http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/14703572211038991;;SEP 2021;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000696047800001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Our aim was to assess how health literacy universal precautions are delivered in routine GP consultations, and explore whether there were differences in how GPs used universal precaution approaches according to areas of deprivation in England. Methods This was a mixed methods study using video and interview data. Ten physicians conducted 217 consultations in primary care settings with adults over 50 years old between July 2017 and March 2018 in England. Eighty consultations (N = 80) met the inclusion criteria of new or persisting problems. Descriptive quantitative analysis of video-recorded consultations using an observation tool and qualitative thematic analysis of transcribed scripts. Metathemes explored differences in physicians' communication by areas of deprivation. Results Descriptive statistics showed physicians used a caring tone of voice and attitude (n = 73, 91.3%) and displayed comfortable body language (n = 69, 86.3%) but infrequently demonstrated profession-specific health literacy universal precaution communication skills, such as the teach-back technique (n = 3, 3.8%).

We video-recorded 16 teaching sessions of kindergarten students' (N = 36) mathematical and programming activities. Students worked in small groups (4-5 students) with robot coding toys on the floor in their classrooms, solving tasks that involved programming these toys to move to various locations on a grid. Drawing on a semiotic mediation perspective, we analyzed video data to identify the mathematics concepts and skills students demonstrated and the overlapping mathematics-programming knowledge exhibited by the students during these programming tasks. We found that kindergarten children used spatial, measurement, and number knowledge, and the design of the tasks, affordances of the robots, and types of programming knowledge influenced how the students engaged with mathematics. The paper concludes with a discussion about the intersections of mathematics and programming knowledge in early childhood, and how programming robot toys elicited opportunities for students to engage with mathematics in dynamic and interconnected ways, thus creating an entry point to reassert mathematics beyond the traditional school content and curriculum.;;;;;Clarke-Midura, Jody/Q-8283-2018;"Clarke-Midura, Jody/0000-0001-5434-0324; Welch Bond, Lise/0000-0003-3887-4910; Lee, Victor/0000-0001-6434-7589";;;;;;;;;;;;;1098-6065;1532-7833;;;;2021 SEP 30;2021;;;;;;;;;;10.1080/10986065.2021.1982666;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10986065.2021.1982666;;SEP 2021;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000701506700001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Few studies, however, have explored early story experiences encountered by infants and toddlers in naturalistic settings. We argue that personal stories about everyday lived experiences are a vital context for considering how toddlers develop communicative competencies as they participate in these stories within their families and communities. The paper presents selected findings from a qualitative study underpinned by a broad theoretical view of story embedded in a sociocultural, participatory framework. We contend that stories are collaborative, social endeavours in which intersubjectivity is accomplished collectively and multimodally. Evidence is offered of the communicative process enacted by 1-year-old Lexie, her parent, teacher and peers, as they shared meaning together in a personal story about eating lunch. Lexie and her family were participants in a wider study of the story experiences of 1-year-old toddlers, within and across their family home and early childhood settings, in a culturally diverse community of Aotearoa New Zealand. Drawing on multimodal ethnography and video data, findings illustrate how Lexie and her family, teacher and peers actively participated together in the weaving of a shared personal story using verbal, visual and kinaesthetic forms of communication. The study contributes to the field of early childhood literacy by providing unique insights into the potential of everyday personal stories as a valuable context for exploring ways children's communicative competencies are developed through relationships in family and community settings.;;;;;;"Gaffney, Janet/0000-0003-0782-2093; White, Amanda/0000-0001-8093-6658";;;;;;;;;;;;;1468-7984;1741-2919;;;;2021 NOV 12;2021;;;;;;;;;1,4688E+16;10.1177/14687984211047998;http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/14687984211047998;;NOV 2021;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000718377300001;View Full Record in Web of Science

An explorative video study;ZEITSCHRIFT FUR ERZIEHUNGSWISSENSCHAFT;;;;;;;;;;;;Religious diversity plays a central role in theories of religious education. However, empirical studies on the role and significance of this diversity in teaching religious education still represent a desideratum of research. This article addresses this desideratum by examining how religious diversity is addressed in Catholic religious education within the framework of an explorative video study.

The findings show that the teaching found negotiates religious diversity primarily under positional aspects, with stylistic aspects playing a secondary role.

Capturing various layers of small group collaborative problem solving in an experiential geometry course in initial teacher education;INSTRUCTIONAL SCIENCE;;;;;;;;;;;;"Collaborative problem solving (CPS) is widely recognized as a prominent 21st-century skill to be mastered. Until recently, research on CPS has often focused on problem solution by the individual; the interest in investigating how the theorized problem-solving constructs function as broader social units, such as pairs or small groups, is relatively recent. Capturing the complexity of CPS processes in group-level interaction is challenging. Therefore, a method of analysis capturing various layers of CPS was developed that aimed for a deeper understanding of CPS as a small-group enactment. In the study, small groups of teacher education students worked on two variations of open-ended CPS tasks-a technology-enhanced task and a task using physical objects. The method, relying on video data, encompassed triangulation of analysis methods and combined the following: (a) directed content analysis of the actualized CPS in groups, (b) process analysis and visualizations, and (c) qualitative cases. Content analysis did not show a large variation in how CPS was actualized in the groups or tasks for either case, whereas process analysis revealed both group- and task-related differences in accordance with the interchange of CPS elements. The qualitative cases exemplified the interaction diversity in the quality of coordination and students' equal participation in groups. It was concluded that combining different methods gives access to various layers of CPS; moreover, it can contribute to a deeper articulation of the CPS as a group-level construct, providing divergent ways to understand CPS in this context.";;;;;;"Naykki, Piia/0000-0002-2931-704X; Jarvela, Sanna/0000-0001-6223-3668; Poysa-Tarhonen, Johanna/0000-0001-6614-0098";;;;;;;;;;;;;0020-4277;1573-1952;;;;FEB;2022;50;1;;;;;1;34;;10.1007/s11251-021-09562-5;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11251-021-09562-5;;NOV 2021;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000722817500001;View Full Record in Web of Science

The rapid growth of online video consumption brings new opportunities for marketing executives and researchers to analyze consumer behavior. However, video also introduces new challenges. Specifically, analyzing unstructured video data presents formidable methodological challenges that limit the use of multimedia data to generate marketing insights. To address this challenge, the authors propose a novel video feature framework based on machine learning and computer vision techniques, which helps marketers predict and understand the consumption of online video from a content-based perspective. The authors apply this framework to two unique data sets: one provided by MasterClass, consisting of 771 online videos and more than 2.6 million viewing records from 225,580 consumers, and another from Crash Course, consisting of 1,127 videos focusing on more traditional education disciplines. The analyses show that the framework proposed in this article can be used to accurately predict both individual-level consumer behavior and aggregate video popularity in these two very different contexts. The authors discuss how their findings and methods can be used to advance management and marketing research with unstructured video data in other contexts such as video marketing and entertainment analytics.;;;;;Smith, Michael D/B-7307-2008;Zhou, Mi/0000-0001-8648-0225;;;;;;;;;;;;;0022-2437;1547-7193;;;;DEC;2021;58;6;;;SI;;1079;1100;;10.1177/00222437211042013;http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00222437211042013;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000718909600004;View Full Record in Web of Science

We investigated how 47 teachers provided feedback in 172 mathematics lessons in Norwegian lower secondary schools. We analyzed the quality of feedback, the quantity of feedback, and whether the feedback addressed students' procedural skills, conceptual understanding, or engagement in mathematical practices. Teachers spent large amounts of time providing concrete and specific feedback, most of it addressing procedural skills while conceptual feedback was less common. The study highlights details of feedback relevant for both pre-and inservice mathematics teacher training. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Using quantitative content analyses, we analyzed videos of students working on complex case-based tasks with regard to their active participation in the group discussions, use of conceptual knowledge and transactive communication during concept-based talk. In addition, we assessed students' individual case knowledge after they finished the group work. Two-level analyses revealed that student teachers in high-structure cooperative learning groups used more concept-driven ideas to solve the case than students in low-structure cooperative learning groups. They also referred to the ideas of other group members more often and externalized their ideas more without referring to each other. Students in high-structure cooperative learning groups gained more case-related knowledge than those in low-structure cooperative learning groups. No difference between conditions was detected for students' active participation in the group work. These findings indicate that emphasizing interdependence and accountability in cooperative groups might not increase the intensity of students' case discussion but does improve its quality.;;;;;Brunstein, Joachim C/C-2437-2008;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2210-6561;2210-657X;;;;FEB;2022;32;;;;;;;;100598;10.1016/j.lcsi.2021.100598;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lcsi.2021.100598;;DEC 2021;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000731786600003;View Full Record in Web of Science

Conversely, research shows that early childhood is a critical time for ER development and imaginative play is an effective tool. Therefore, this paper aims to explore whether and how collective play can support ER development of the young orphanage children. Based on the cultural-historical theory of emotion and ER development, we implemented an educational experiment (Hedegaard, 2008b) of collective play for ten weeks in an orphan-care institution in China. Diandian (pseudonym), aged 4.5 years, was observed as she expressed fear towards a scary cleaner in her everyday life and participated in the collective play activities. 78 h of digital video data were collected and analysed. The findings demonstrate the process where the raw emotion of fear was made conscious through enacting and re-enacting play roles, which eventually led to Diandian's regulation of fear in play. We argue that even though an orphanage is not comparable to typical family settings, there are still possibilities for a dynamic social environment to be created for its children where ER development is supported pedagogically.;;;;;Meng, Xianyu/GXH-3231-2022;"Meng, Xianyu/0000-0002-7042-2677; Fleer, Marilyn/0000-0002-1224-5510";;;;;;;;;;;;;2210-6561;2210-657X;;;;FEB;2022;32;;;;;;;;100590;10.1016/j.lcsi.2021.100590;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lcsi.2021.100590;;DEC 2021;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000731786600004;View Full Record in Web of Science

However, learners are rarely afforded the opportunity to go outdoors to learn chemistry. This study investigates how problem-based learning outdoors can facilitate the understanding of basic chemistry in teacher education. A teaching unit was designed according to which student teachers at two Norwegian universities were asked to examine and identify corroded metals in the nearby outdoor environment and propose solutions to avoid this corrosion. Video data from this task were collected by using chest-mounted cameras for four groups of student teachers (N = 17). A thematic analysis of the videos yielded four themes related to the student teachers' use of content knowledge and experimental competence. Based on these findings, three learning opportunities were deduced for how the nearby outdoor environment allows learners to use everyday phenomena for learning basic chemistry. First, the availability of different corrosion incidents allowed the student teachers to choose and solve one of interest to them. Second, the proximity of the outdoor location to the classroom enabled the seamless continuity of discussions when switching between the learning arenas, and allowed for different approaches to solve the task. Third, being asked to conduct analyses outside customary laboratory routines led to an unexpected awareness of health and safety issues among the student teachers, indicating that outdoor chemistry is an overlooked opportunity for teaching these.;;;;;;"Jegstad, Kirsti Marie/0000-0002-4723-7094; Hoper, Jan/0000-0002-8327-3500";;;;;;;;;;;;;1109-4028;1756-1108;;;;APR 1;2022;23;2;;;;;361;372;;10.1039/d1rp00127b;http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1rp00127b;;DEC 2021;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000732846700001;View Full Record in Web of Science

These techniques offer novel opportunities for creating interactions with digital portrayals of individuals that can inspire and intrigue us. AI-generated portrayals of characters can feature synthesized faces, bodies and voices of anyone, from a fictional character to a historical figure, or even a deceased family member. Although negative use cases of this technology have dominated the conversation so far, in this Perspective we highlight emerging positive use cases of AI-generated characters, specifically in supporting learning and well-being. We demonstrate an easy-to-use AI character generation pipeline to enable such outcomes and discuss ethical implications as well as the need for including traceability to help maintain trust in the generated media. As we look towards the future, we foresee generative media as a crucial part of the ever growing landscape of human-AI interaction. Digitally recreating the likeness of a person used to be a costly and complex process. Through the use of generative models, AI-generated characters can now be made with relative ease.

We compare and analyze two research settings that use the latest video technology to capture classroom interactions in mathematics education, namely, The Social Unit of Learning (SUL) project of the University of Melbourne and the MathTrack project of the University of Helsinki. While using these two settings as examples, we have structured our reflections around themes pertinent to video research in general, namely, research methods, data management, and research ethics. SUL and MathTrack share an understanding of mathematics learning as social multimodal practice, and provide possibilities for zooming into the situational micro interactions that construct collaborative problem-solving learning. Both settings provide rich data for in-depth analyses of peer interactions and learning processes. The settings share special needs for technical support and data management, as well as attention to ethical aspects from the perspective of the participants' security and discretion. SUL data are especially suitable for investigating interactions on a broad scope, addressing how multiple interactional processes intertwine. MathTrack, on the other hand, enables exploration of participants' visual attention in detail and its role in learning.

J;Tang, KS;;;;Tang, Kok-Sing;;;Material inquiry and transformation as prerequisite processes of scientific argumentation: Toward a social-material theory of argumentation;JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN SCIENCE TEACHING;;;;;;;;;;;;Argumentation as a scientific practice has largely been examined along an epistemic and/or dialogic perspective in science education research. Both perspectives have sidelined the use of real material objects that are indispensable for scientists to construct arguments about the natural world. To address this gap, this article investigates how material objects are used to coordinate with our speech and actions to shape argumentation in secondary physical science. Drawing on actor-network theory, the article reframes argumentation as a chain of human-material interactions incorporating the role of physical things to construct evidence. Based on a collective case study comprising classroom video data generated from two grade nine science classrooms, the article examines how teachers and students used material objects to engage in argumentation related to qualitative analysis in chemistry and Newton's laws of motions in physics. The analysis reveals two major themes: (a) material inquiry as the framing of questions and statements about the behavior or property of the material world and (b) material transformation as the orchestration of material objects, embodied actions, and words to actively create evidence. This article concludes that both material inquiry and material transformation are essential prerequisites for scientific argumentation to take place, not only in research laboratories, but also in science classrooms. The contribution to the development of a future socio-material theory of scientific argumentation, which takes material agency and multimodal discourse into account, are also discussed.;;;;;Tang, Kok-Sing/I-3245-2019;Tang, Kok-Sing/0000-0002-2764-539X;;;;;;;;;;;;;0022-4308;1098-2736;;;;AUG;2022;59;6;;;;;969;1009;;10.1002/tea.21749;http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tea.21749;;JAN 2022;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000748255400001;View Full Record in Web of Science
J;Lanouette, K;;;;Lanouette, Kathryn;;;Emotion, place, and practice: Exploring the interplay in children's engagement in ecologists' sampling practices;SCIENCE EDUCATION;;;;;;;;;;;;In science education, there has been a sustained focus on supporting the emergence of science practices in K-12 and field-based settings. Recent work has elevated the integral role of emotion in sparking and sustaining such disciplinary practices, deepening the field's understanding of what is entailed in doing science. Yet even as we gain this richer understanding of practice, less attention has been given to the places where practice emerges. These places play a critical role in the co-emergence of emotion and practice, and while separate strands of research have elevated emotion and practice or, alternately, place and practice, rarely has their dynamic relationship been considered together. In this article, I explore this interplay of emotion, place, and practice emergent in children's sampling practices within a multiweek curriculum centered around their schoolyard soil ecosystem. Through a comparative case study analysis of two student pairs using video data, student interviews, and classroom artifacts, my analysis reveals how children's emergent emotion was entangled in their relationships with the schoolyard and life within, shaping not only how they engaged in sampling practices but also what dimensions of the ecological system they attended to. I argue that emotion and place should be central to the design, teaching, and analysis of learning contexts, in turn centering the social and emplaced dimensions of science disciplinary practices for children and scientists alike. Implications for science teaching and learning are discussed, with particular consideration of field-based sciences.;;;;;;Lanouette, Kathryn/0000-0001-9154-8386;;;;;;;;;;;;;0036-8326;1098-237X;;;;MAY;2022;106;3;;;;;610;644;;10.1002/sce.21702;http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/sce.21702;;FEB 2022;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000749345900001;View Full Record in Web of Science

The programme incorporated Open Educational Resources (OER), specifically OER4school materials, that were provided via tablet computers for teachers and students. A mixed-methods case study was employed to explore teachers' perceptions, knowledge, experiences of interactive learning and teaching in relation to this TPD, as well as their perceptions and experiences of the role and value of using technology to support student learning. Video data from structured lesson observations were triangulated with teacher post-lesson interviews and thematically coded. The interviews indicated that all teachers demonstrated a change in mindset and a clear understanding of interactive teaching methods. However, the structured observations revealed that only half of the teachers were using these interactive methods. Teachers also emphasised the value of OER and tablet technologies in improving lesson planning and making classroom learning more authentic. The use of technology, as both a TPD medium and as a classroom tool, showed potential to enhance the quality of TPD and teacher quality.

Three PSTs selected by convenience sampling (22-24 years old), their 60 eighth-grade students (three classes: 38 boys, 22 girls, M-age = 13.3), and a mentoring team (one teacher educator, one university supervisor, and one cooperating teacher) participated in the study. The PSTs participated in a two-stage programme where they learned how to teach volleyball using SE-SGA, and then implemented an SE-SGA unit during their school placement. Using audio/video data from 30 lessons, we examined PSTs' SCK (content development, depth of content knowledge) on a lesson-by-lesson basis. We also assessed the 2v2 game-play performance of PSTs' students across three assessment points. Descriptive statistics were computed for SCK scores and repeated measures analysis of variances were used to analyse variance in game-play variables over time. Results showed improvement in PSTs' SCK and students' game-play. The PSTs showed strong SCK, with index levels above the 3.0 cut point, and progressive use of informing, refining, and applying-game tasks over time. Students improved in most game-play variables (namely 'serve', 'reception', 'setting') and the 'game performance index' over time. Student game-play development seemed to be strongly influenced by an interdependent interaction between PSTs' SCK and additional situated, model-based features of content development (i.e. extensive application of knowledge in competition events, the problem-solving focus of the refining tasks).;;;;;;"Teixeira, Joaquim/0000-0002-6050-2729; Ribeiro, Eugenio/0000-0001-7319-3059; Farias, Claudio/0000-0002-1364-0539";;;;;;;;;;;;;1356-336X;1741-2749;;;;AUG;2022;28;3;;;;;816;834;1356336X221084516;10.1177/1356336X221084516;http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1356336X221084516;;MAR 2022;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000772949000001;View Full Record in Web of Science

The results revealed that social-emotional support and instruction quality were the key dimensions relating to the characteristics and differences of mathematics lessons in Shanghai. While the former had a significantly positive impact on students' general mathematics self-efficacy, the latter had a significantly positive impact on students' mathematics interest.

To address this issue, we analyzed video data of how teachers invoke competence aims from the national curriculum in their instructional work in six classrooms. The analytical procedures were derived from interaction analysis. The analysis focuses on how such formulations explicitly mediate social interaction as it unfolds on a micro level. The findings show that competence aims gain different functions as they are mobilized in classroom practice; in other words, they serve different purposes in teachers' instructional work and anticipate different modes of student participation. In this study, the competence aims were (a) invoked as a source of authority, (b) translated into instructions, and (c) mobilized to obtain social order in the classroom. More rarely, the competence aims were used in meta-level discussions, where they functioned to reach agreements on how to pursue work toward joint goals. We discuss the implications of these ways of invoking competence aims for student participation.";;;;;;Hontvedt, Magnus/0000-0003-0774-6828;;;;;;;;;;;;;0256-2928;1878-5174;;;;JUN;2023;38;2;;;;;881;902;;10.1007/s10212-022-00610-3;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10212-022-00610-3;;APR 2022;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000777637800001;View Full Record in Web of Science

The video study investigates 18 classes that all used the same curriculum resources aimed at developing 367 seventh graders' conceptual understanding of percentages to identify the interaction of quality dimensions, the enactment of given curriculum resources, and students' mathematical achievement (when controlling for mathematical preknowledge and language proficiency). Multilevel regression analysis revealed that three quality dimensions that can easily be supported by the curriculum resources (Mathematical Richness, Cognitive Demand, and Connecting Registers) were on a high level, and their variance had no additional interaction with students' achievement. In contrast, the 4 quality dimensions that were enacted in the teacher-student interaction with more variance (Agency, Equitable Access, Discursive Demand, and, in particular, Use of Student Contributions) had a significant additional impact on student achievement. These findings reveal important insights into the implementability of equitable instructional approaches.;;;;;Prediger, Susanne/AAB-8356-2020;Prediger, Susanne/0000-0001-6541-259X;;;;;;;;;;;;;1571-0068;1573-1774;;;;MAR;2023;21;3;;;;;811;834;;10.1007/s10763-022-10274-6;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10763-022-10274-6;;APR 2022;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000789088200001;View Full Record in Web of Science

As educators seek to increase refugee students' access to powerful mathematics learning, an understanding of how refugee families view and participate in their children's mathematics learning can offer insights for how we might reach the goal of equitable educational access. Purpose/Focus of Study: In the Goc-MAT project, we focused on developing equitable mathematics teaching practices with teachers (K-3) in schools highly populated with refugee children. The research that we present here, drawing on notions of community cultural wealth capital, offers a multifaceted view of how families of young children with refugee status articulated understandings of their roles in children's mathematics learning. Setting: Our fieldwork took place in four different cities highly populated by people with refugee status in Turkey, the country located at the center of the worldwide trend of mass migration. Participants: We examined data from families (N = 54, mainly from Syria) who participated in the family engagement component of the larger project, carried out through multilingual family mathematics workshops. Research Design: We employed qualitative research methods and conducted two-year-long observations and video recordings in the context of multilingual family mathematics workshops. In the workshops, families, teachers, and researchers engaged in patterns and early algebra activities, as well as in family conversations facilitated through open-ended prompts, mathematics picture books, and educational journey maps. Over two years, we collected data comprising recorded dialogues with families, artifacts produced in the workshops, and video data of families' mathematical interactions. Findings: Our analysis yielded two key understandings: (1) Family engagement practices around mathematics set a context to realize the nuanced nature of refugee families' cultural wealth and efforts for their children's education; and (2) refugee families' knowledge of mathematics itself as a discipline and their mathematical capital, which are typically not recognized in school contexts, can serve as resources for mathematics teaching. Conclusions/Recommendations: The findings provide insight for teachers, researchers, and policy makers about how we might engage multilingual children and families with refugee status in powerful ways in mathematics education.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0161-4681;1467-9620;;;;MAY;2022;124;5;;;;;49;68;;10.1177/01614681221103948;http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/01614681221103948;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000805995000004;View Full Record in Web of Science

Ten students sought help from their teachers at least once in both contexts, yet interpersonal differences were observed. Although student help seeking partly fell into traditional  help-seeking categories (i.e., instrumental help seeking, confirmation-asking), new help-seeking categories also emerged (i.e., ambiguous and organizational help seeking). Students always used verbal means to solicit help; in addition, both nonverbal and verbal means to draw teachers' attention were identified. More than 70% of help giving consisted of providing direct feedback, explaining, or instructing.

The multi-level analysis in the present study uncovers emotional support trajectories within teacher-dyad and dyadic interaction contexts among at-risk elementary students over a three-semester computer-supported intervention. A cluster analysis was conducted for all students (n = 318), where most intervention students had cumulated risks in socio-motivational and reading competencies. The time spent by 12 dyads within the two interaction contexts was analyzed from a vast amount of video data. The results suggested that simply allocating support time may be insufficient and its quality should be scrutinized. An in-depth video analysis of four dyads, illustrated with interaction excerpts and summary figures, indicated that teachers differed in their ability to calibrate their emotional support dynamically. The dyadic interactions of at-risk students were mostly on-task and neutral or positive. The intertwining of teacher-dyad and dyadic emotional support indicated that mechanisms positively contributed to enhancing multi-perspective academic competencies, although some risks were noted. Acknowledging the emotional states of others and successfully regulating one's own emotions were critical. Thus, infusing support for emotional competence and regulation strategies into both teacher and basic education is recommended.;;;;;;Salo, Anne-Elina/0000-0002-4112-0071;;;;;;;;;;;;;2210-6561;2210-657X;;;;JUN;2022;34;;;;;;;;100631;10.1016/j.lcsi.2022.100631;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lcsi.2022.100631;;MAY 2022;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000799262000001;View Full Record in Web of Science

But is this really true, and if so, what is changing and in what way? This paper addresses the question by investigating teaching practices in contexts of tablet-supported collaborative learning by means of video data. The findings of the study provide insights into complex configurations of incremental transformation in which persistence and change are intertwined at different levels of interaction organization: On the one hand, it can be confirmed that the inclusion of digital media does not fundamentally shift patterns of educational interaction that constitute social order in classroom contexts. But on the other hand, it can be shown, that the use of tablets mediatizes teaching practices that are realized in group work by dealing with modified access to knowledge resources and by referring to digitalized knowledge products.;;;;;Herrle, Matthias/HHC-1369-2022;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1434-663X;1862-5215;;;;DEC;2022;25;6;;;;;1389;1408;;10.1007/s11618-022-01099-8;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11618-022-01099-8;;JUN 2022;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000810378400001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Based on Rogoff's three planes of analysis (i.e., personal, community, and interpersonal), we gathered survey, interview, and video data to understand the motivations of sixth graders in a special education mathematics classroom as well as classroom conditions that supported motivation during a unit on fractions. By the end of that unit, students reported improved ability beliefs and attributed the changes to increased conceptual understanding of fractions, exposure to strategies for sense making, and the additional time and assistance provided to them. Through video analysis, we also found that having students verbalize their thinking about the mathematics can provide opportunities to identify remediation needs and thus support productive participation and positive ability beliefs.

However, it remains unclear how the affective states vary during collaboration and how they occur with regulation of learning. Appropriate methods are needed to track both group affective states and these interaction processes. Aims The present study identifies different socio-emotional interaction episodes during groups' collaborative learning and examines how group affective states fluctuate with regulation of learning during these episodes. Sample The participants were 54 secondary school students working in groups across four science learning sessions. Methods Multichannel process data (video, electrodermal activity [EDA]) were collected in an authentic classroom. Groups' affective states were measured with emotional valence captured from video data, and activation captured as sympathetic arousal from EDA data. Regulation of learning was observed from the videotaped interactions. Results The study disclosed four clusters of socio-emotional interaction episodes (positive, negative, occasional regulation, frequent regulation), which differed in terms of fluctuation of affective states and activated regulation of learning. These clustered episodes confirm how affective states are constantly reset by socio-emotional interactions and regulation of learning. The results also show that states requiring regulation do not automatically lead to its activation. Conclusions By advancing existing understanding of how group level socio-emotional processes contribute to regulation of learning, the study has implications for educational design and psychological practice. Methodologically, it contributes to collaborative learning research by employing multiple data channels (including biophysiological measures) to explore the various dimensions of socio-emotional processes in groups.;;;;;Saqr, Mohammed/AAH-2520-2020;"Saqr, Mohammed/0000-0001-5881-3109; Jarvela, Sanna/0000-0001-6223-3668; Tormanen, Tiina/0000-0001-5421-4213; Malmberg, Jonna/0000-0002-8890-4068";;;;;;;;;;;;;0007-0998;2044-8279;;;;APR;2023;93;;;1;SI;;48;70;e12525;10.1111/bjep.12525;http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bjep.12525;;JUN 2022;;;;;;35748024;;;;;WOS:000814901000001;View Full Record in Web of Science

As such, the study contributes to the field of education and argumentation with new insights into how children negotiate validity and relevance in relation to the task when asked to argue their stance on an equity/equality matter. The data consist of transcripts of 247 min of video recordings capturing 13 group discussions (54 children, split into groups of four to five, and two teachers) in the German primary school subject Sachunterricht. The findings clarify how the children dynamically move in and out of the task premises, and at times question them, both implicitly and explicitly. The task's openness and ambiguity are discussed in relation to the children's arguing and premising. The teacher's role as mediator in group discussions is contrasted with other forms of classroom discourse. Furthermore, the relevance for researchers to consider the social and cultural circumstances of research in schools - for example, when interpreting children's utterances - is emphasized.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2210-6561;2210-657X;;;;AUG;2022;35;;;;;;;;100648;10.1016/j.lcsi.2022.100648;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lcsi.2022.100648;;JUN 2022;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000827253200001;View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the available empirical evidence is mixed. Building on previous research into TSE, we examined whether assessing class-/task-specific TSE gives a more accurate indication of the associations between TSE assessments and student-rated teaching quality. The analyses were based on the English sample of the Teaching and Learning International Survey (TALIS) Video Study. Mathematics teachers (N = 86) rated their self-efficacy beliefs using generalized task-specific TSE items and class-/task-specific TSE items. Their students (N = 1,930) rated the quality of teaching in their math class. Multilevel regression analyses revealed stronger associations between student-rated teaching quality and class-/task-specific TSE than generalized task-specific TSE.

While researchers argue that a common vocabulary of teaching is necessary for the field of classroom research to move forward, instructional features vary across classrooms and contexts, which poses serious measuring challenges. In this article, we argue that potential biases embedded in observation systems have to be identified and addressed in order for interpretations of results across different classrooms and contexts to be valid and relevant. We identify three aspects of possible systematic biases (related to the grain size of conceptualization, operationalization, and sequencing of lessons) and how these may influence ratings of instructional quality when an established observation system (the Protocol for Language Arts Teaching Observations [PLATO]) is applied in the contexts of Nordic mathematics classrooms.

This study examined teachers' behavior patterns in interpreting information from dashboards, and obtained their views about the potential barriers in interpreting dashboard information. Fourteen pre-service teachers participated in the study and data were collected from multiple sources. In total, 1,346 min of video data on teachers' guiding behavior and approximately 27,000 words from a cued retrospective report and interview data were generated. A two-stage approach was adopted to process the data. Based on the video analysis in the first stage, we extracted teachers' four typical behavior patterns in finding and reading dashboard information and two behavior patterns when explaining information from dashboards. Thematic analysis at the second stage identified useful indicators for teacher guidance in CSCL and some major barriers teachers encountered in interpreting information. These findings may help improve the design of dashboards and show how teachers integrate dashboards into their daily teaching practice, thereby enhancing students' collaboration and learning.;;;;;;Zhang, Muhua/0000-0001-8656-3290;;;;;;;;;;;;;1042-1629;1556-6501;;;;JUN;2022;70;3;;;;;1035;1058;;10.1007/s11423-022-10102-2;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11423-022-10102-2;;JUL 2022;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000824837100001;View Full Record in Web of Science

This exploratory study investigated the self-regulatory strategies that young students (N = 48, M-age = 10.75) utilized while individually completing a 20-min online research task about space. Video data was coded using Azevedo et al.'s (2004) established coding scheme for analyzing self-regulatory behavior in hypermedia environments. Results showed that young students spent the majority of their time using cognitive strategies (M = 75.26%) to read and summarise information to complete the task. Little time was taken to plan (M = 6.99%) or monitor (M = 5.92%) their work or learning processes, which are key attributes of effective self-regulation. The study reveals the disparity between the ability to navigate within a hypermedia environment and utilizing planning and monitoring processes to enhance learning while using digital tools. This study highlights the need for the explicit teaching of planning and monitoring strategies in order for young students to develop the full range of self-regulation skills they need when using technology, for instance while learning from home during COVID-19.

We had three research questions focused on children's game play: 1) How does the structure of each game influence children's play? 2) Do children play more or less independently depending on the game they play? 3) Do children who play the games more independently learn more coding skills? Three researchers coded more than 6 h of video data showing children's play with digital coding games. Findings include, that the type of game did influence the different ways that children behaved while playing. However, during both games, children had the same amount of inde-pendent play. Children who played more independently during Daisy the Dinosaur learned more coding skills. This may be because these children were focusing more on the game than their peers as we did not find a similar effect for the game Kodable. We discuss the ways that children play structured vs. open structured (i.e., sandbox) digital games with a particular focus on how game play may influence learning.

The HRI game framework includes four functional modules: video data acquisition, image recognition modeling, a deep learning algorithm (YOLOv5), and information feedback. First, we built a gesture recognition model containing 10,000 pictures of children's gestures, using the YOLOv5 algorithm. The average accuracy in recognition training was 98.7%. Second, we recruited 120 children with attention deficits (aged from 9 to 12 years) to play the HRI games, including 60 girls and 60 boys. In the HRI game experiment, we obtained 8640 sample data, which were normalized and processed.According to the results, we found that the girls had better visual short-term memory and a shorter response time than boys.

These findings are discussed in light of the goals of the study and prior research on post-CCSS instruction in classrooms across the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0013-5984;1554-8279;;;;SEP 1;2022;123;1;;;;;37;63;;10.1086/720732;http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/720732;;SEP 2022;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000821908600001;View Full Record in Web of Science
J;Wilson, J;;;;Wilson, Jonee;;;Initial Steps in Developing Classroom Observation Rubrics Designed Around Instructional Practices that Support Equity and Access in Classrooms with Potential for Success;TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD;;;;;;;;;;;;Background:The field of mathematics education has made progress toward generating a set of instructional practices that could support improvements in the learning opportunities made available to groups of students who historically have been underserved and marginalized. Studies that contribute to this growing body of work are often conducted in learning environments that are framed as successful. As a researcher who is concerned with issues of equity and who acknowledges the importance of closely attending to the quality of the mathematical activity in which students are being asked to engage, my stance on successful learning environments pulls from both Gutierrez's descriptions of what characterizes classrooms as aiming for equity and the emphasis on the importance of conceptually oriented goals for student learning that is outlined in documents like the Standards. Though as a field we are growing in our knowledge of practices that support these successful learning environments, this knowledge has not yet been reflected in many of the observational tools, rubrics, and protocols used to study these environments. In addition, there is a growing need to develop empirically grounded ways of attending to the extent to which the practices that are being outlined in research literature actually contribute to the success of these learning environments. Purpose:The purpose of this article is to explore one way of meeting this growing need by describing the complex work of developing a set of classroom observation rubrics (the Equity and Access Rubrics for Mathematics Instruction, EAR-MI) designed to support efforts in identifying and observing critical features of classrooms characterized as having potential for success. In developing the rubrics, I took as my starting place findings from an analysis that compared a set of classrooms that were characterized as demonstrating aspects of successful learning environments and a set of classrooms that were not characterized as successful. This paper not only describes the process of developing the rubrics, but also outlines some of the qualitative differences that distinguished more and less effective examples of the practices the rubrics are designed to capture. Research Design:In designing the rubrics, I engaged in multiple cycles of qualitative analyses of video data collected from a large-scale study. Specifically, I iteratively designed, tested, and revised the developing rubrics while consistently collaborating with, consulting with, and receiving feedback from different experts in the field of education. Conclusions:Although I fully acknowledge and recognize that there are several tensions and limitations of this work, I argue that developing rubrics like the EAR-MI is still worthwhile. One reason that I give for continuing these types of efforts is that it contributes to the work of breaking down forms of practice into components and identifying key aspects of specific practices that are critical for supporting student learning in ways that make potentially productive routines of action visible to and learnable by others, which may ultimately contribute to the development of more successful learning environments. I also argue that rubrics like the EAR-MI have the potential to support researchers in developing stronger evidence of the effectiveness of practices that prior research has identified as critical for marginalized students and in more accurately and concretely identifying and describing learning environments as having potential for success. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0161-4681;1467-9620;;;;NOV;2022;124;11;;;;;179;217;;10.1177/01614681221140963;http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/01614681221140963;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000893455800007;View Full Record in Web of Science

K.; Schindler, Ann-Kathrin; Berberat, Pascal O.; Gartmeier, Martin";;;How is modern bedside teaching structured? A video analysis of learning content, social and spatial structures;BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION;;;;;;;;;;;;Background Bedside teaching (BST) is an essential and traditional clinical teaching format. It has been subject to various impediments and has transformed over time. Besides a decrease in bedside time, there has also been a didactic diversification. In order to use time at the bedside effectively and understand the current design of BST, we here offer an evidence-based insight into how BST is practiced. This may serve as a basis for a refinement of its didactic design. Methods In the current study, we investigate the interrelationships between learning content and the social as well as spatial structures of BST. To this end, we have empirically analysed almost 80 hours of video material from a total of 36 BST sessions with good interrater reliability. Results BST lasted on average 125 min, most of which was spent in plenary and less than a third of the time at the patient's bedside. History taking was primarily practiced at the bedside while case presentations, clinical reasoning and theoretical knowledge were largely taught away from the patient. Clinical examination took place to a similar extent in the patient's room and in the theory room. Conclusions Even though the filmed BSTs are not purely bedside, the teaching format investigated here is a typical example of undergraduate medical education. In order to maximize the teaching time available, a suitable learning space should be provided in addition to the bedside. Moreover, the clinical examination should be revised in its general sequence prior to the BST, and conscious decisions should be made regarding the social structure so as to optimize the potential of small groups and plenary sessions.;;;;;;"Blaschke, Anna-Lena/0000-0002-1111-0905; Gartmeier, Martin/0000-0002-5025-0003";;;;;;;;;;;;;;1472-6920;;;;NOV 15;2022;22;1;;;;;;;790;10.1186/s12909-022-03855-0;http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12909-022-03855-0;;;;;;;;36380308;;;;;WOS:000884284500003;View Full Record in Web of Science

Quantitative data collected include 32 videos of eight groups of students in four MPS periods that were designed based on a simplified version of Polya's four-stage model, and their worksheets completed in each period. The video data were coded based on a framework with low-level and high-level cognitive behaviors as well as management behaviors and were analyzed using lag sequence analysis from which three types of peer tutoring models were determined: organization-oriented, cognitive-supported, and cognitive-guided. ANOVA analysis showed that the groups with cognitive-guided tutors performed significantly better than the groups guided by cognitive-supported and organization-oriented tutors, between which the performance difference did not reach a significant level. The results of this study suggest that training provided to peer tutors should focus more on how to stimulate high-level cognitive thinking skills than on organization skills.;;;;;"Jiang, Chunlian/R-8394-2019; He, XL/ABC-9994-2021";"Jiang, Chunlian/0000-0002-2740-1870; He, XL/0000-0001-7880-8710; Chenyang, Wang/0000-0002-2753-6505; Fang, Jing/0000-0002-9244-5896";;;;;;;;;;;;;1360-2357;1573-7608;;;;JUN;2023;28;6;;;;;6595;6618;;10.1007/s10639-022-11429-2;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10639-022-11429-2;;NOV 2022;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000885424300002;View Full Record in Web of Science

Therefore, an automatic recognition method of students' behavior in English classroom based on deep learning model is proposed. The deep learning model is mainly applied to the processing of English classroom video data. The research results show that the video data processing model proposed in this paper has no significant difference between the data obtained from the recognition of students' positive and negative behaviors and the real statistical data, but the recognition efficiency has been significantly improved. In addition, in order to verify the recognition effect of the deep learning model in the real English classroom environment, the statistical results of 100 recognition result maps are compared with the results of manual marking, and the average recognition accuracy of 100 recognition effect maps is finally obtained, which is 87.33%. It can be concluded that the learning behavior recognition model proposed in this paper has a high accuracy and meets the needs of daily teaching. It further verifies that the developed behavior recognition model can be used to detect students' behavior in English class, which is very helpful to analyze students' psychological state and improve learning efficiency.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1664-1078;;;;;NOV 22;2022;13;;;;;;;;1025304;10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1025304;http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1025304;;;;;;;;36483717;;;;;WOS:000893978000001;View Full Record in Web of Science
J;"Chan, MCE; Jazby, D";;;;"Chan, Man Ching Esther; Jazby, Dan";;;Positioning video in classroom research: Ontological and epistemic tensions;LEARNING CULTURE AND SOCIAL INTERACTION;;;;;;;;;;;;While the use of video as a data collection tool in classroom-based research is widespread, a tension exists between different approaches to the use of video as a research tool. Researchers vary in the ontological status that they afford video footage and the way they use footage to construct knowledge claims. This paper presents a set of metaphors that describe how video may be positioned in research projects in order to identify the ontological status afforded video data and the epistemic implications this entails. We argue that the different ways that video is posi-tioned in projects lead to the footage collected having different ontological status and we present three illustrative example projects to exemplify these differences. Applying the metaphors to the example projects reveals a tension between the researchers' carefully constructed framing of ontological and epistemic positions. Our analysis suggests that using footage as evidence to support knowledge claims privileges an ontological and epistemic position which views video footage as a replayable record of sense data, align with a positivist position. In each illustrative project, the ontological status of footage was layered - it was both an objective record of activities of interest, but also was treated as a subjective and fallible data source when used to construct claims about teacher experience. Our analysis highlighted the complexity in the use of the video as a research tool for classroom research and the need for more nuanced ontological and epistemic understanding to make informed decisions in research design and to support knowledge claims.;;;;;"Jazby, Dan/ITV-0872-2023; Chan, Man Ching Esther/O-8741-2016";"Jazby, Dan/0000-0002-8897-113X; Chan, Man Ching Esther/0000-0001-6066-0738";;;;;;;;;;;;;2210-6561;2210-657X;;;;DEC;2022;37;;;;;;;;100669;10.1016/j.lcsi.2022.100669;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lcsi.2022.100669;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000871294800002;View Full Record in Web of Science
J;Daly, A;;;;Daly, Annie;;;Race talk tensions: practicing racial literacy in a fourth-grade classroom;ENGLISH TEACHING-PRACTICE AND CRITIQUE;;;;;;;;;;;;PurposeThere is a pressing need to teach students how to talk critically about race to understand the personal and political implications of racism in the contemporary US society. Classroom race talk, however, often includes moments of discomfort or confusion as teachers and students navigate new norms for making sense of race and racism. The purpose of this paper is to examine how one white teacher and her multiracial class of fourth-grade students navigated race talk tensions while reading and discussing shared texts. Design/methodology/approachData for this paper were collected as part of a larger, year-long qualitative study on antiracist pedagogy. In this paper, the author analyzes video data of classroom race talk recorded during whole-class and small-group literacy lessons. Using inductive coding and reconstructive critical discourse analysis, the author examines how the teacher and students co-constructed meaning during tense or confusing conversational moments. FindingsThe findings demonstrate that the teacher and students jointly mediated tensions by using the practices of racial literacy, which included learning about the history of racial inequality in the USA, considering racism as structural and systemic rather than individual and asking and answering questions for continued inquiry and critical self-reflection. While previous research studies have characterized race talk tensions as problems or obstacles to student learning, the findings from this study suggest that tensions can be generative to developing and enacting racial literacy. Originality/valueIn the current political climate, alarmist rhetoric issued by conservative politicians and media outlets has discredited race talk as harmful or damaging to children. This study offers a positive reframing of tensions, which may provide teachers encouragement to pursue literacy instruction that equips students with knowledge and skills to better understand and confront racism.;;;;;;Daly, Annie/0000-0002-6376-9664;;;;;;;;;;;;;1175-8708;;;;;MAR 20;2023;22;1;;;SI;;61;78;;10.1108/ETPC-02-2022-0028;http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/ETPC-02-2022-0028;;DEC 2022;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000892421500001;View Full Record in Web of Science
J;"Boschl, F; Forbes, C; Lange-Schubert, K";;;;"Boeschl, Florian; Forbes, Cory; Lange-Schubert, Kim";;;Investigating scientific modeling practices in US and German elementary science classrooms: A comparative, cross-national video study;SCIENCE EDUCATION;;;;;;;;;;;;Science education reform efforts have emphasized the incorporation of more authentic and meaningful scientific practices into formal learning environments. With this focus on practices, such as scientific modeling, a powerful tool for sense-making and reasoning, comes a need to observe and understand if and how it is actually occurring, particularly in elementary science learning environments. To address this need, and moving forward an international, collaborative research effort centered around scientific modeling, we undertook a cross-national observational study in which we used an observation protocol to characterize scientific modeling practices in elementary classrooms in both the United States and Germany. Drawing on existing video-based datasets from multiple projects, this study's findings provide empirical evidence for model-based teaching and learning and explore the relative frequencies of relevant modeling subpractices (i.e., construction, use, evaluation, and revision of scientific models) in regular, day-to-day elementary science classrooms. This study also illustrates the differences and similarities between German and American science instruction. In general, students in both countries experience model construction more often than other modeling practices. German teachers more consistently foreground anchoring phenomena and students' questions/preconceptions as part of the modeling process, thus leading to slightly higher overall modeling scores-despite a complete lack of model evaluation and revision in any of the observed German classrooms. Ultimately, however, young learners in both nations seem to experience alarmingly little opportunities to engage in any of the modeling subpractices. Particularly in terms of modeling as a means to make sense of phenomena, constrained by teachers most commonly using finished representations (i.e., models) of phenomena and processes to teach science/deliver content. Our results indicate the need for a greater focus on all scientific modeling subprocesses, particularly the integration of scientific modeling with already established, more general (e.g., inquiry-based) strategies for effective science teaching and an emphasis on actualizing modeling as an authentic sense-making endeavor.;;;;;;"Boschl, Florian/0000-0002-9556-7645; Forbes, Cory/0000-0003-2230-4251; Lange-Schubert, Kim/0000-0003-0815-9094";;;;;;;;;;;;;0036-8326;1098-237X;;;;MAR;2023;107;2;;;;;368;400;;10.1002/sce.21780;http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/sce.21780;;DEC 2022;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000893799300001;View Full Record in Web of Science

A cross-sectional video study;BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION;;;;;;;;;;;;Background: Case-based group discussions (CBGD) are a specific, interaction-focused format dedicated to fostering medical students' skills in applying basic biomedical knowledge to patient cases. Existing conceptions of CBGD suggest that a gradient towards increased opportunities for students to make elaborative verbal contributions is an important element of such seminars. To verify this assumption, we investigate empirically if clinical teachers progress from more basic, knowledge-oriented questions towards more advanced, elaboration-oriented questions in such seminars. Methods: We videotaped 21 different clinical teachers and 398 medical students in 32 CBGD-seminars on surgery and internal medicine. We coded closed-reproductive and open-elaborative teacher questions as well as reproductive and elaborative student responses to these questions. Inter-rater reliability was satisfactory. To determine trends regarding the teacher questions / student responses, we compared eight time-segments of equal duration per seminar. Results: Overall, clinical teachers asked more closed-reproductive than open-elaborative questions. Students gave more reproductive than elaborative responses. Regarding the frequencies of these forms of teacher questions / student responses, we found no significant differences over time. Conclusions: Clinical teachers did not deliberately modify the types of questions over time to push students towards more elaborative responses. We conclude that the critical question to which degree promising teaching approaches are actually put into clinical teaching practice should be raised more purposefully in medical education research.;;;;;Hapfelmeier, Alexander/I-9966-2019;"Hapfelmeier, Alexander/0000-0001-6765-6352; Gartmeier, Martin/0000-0002-5025-0003";;;;;;;;;;;;;;1472-6920;;;;DEC 15;2022;22;1;;;;;;;871;10.1186/s12909-022-03944-0;http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12909-022-03944-0;;;;;;;;36522722;;;;;WOS:000899575900002;View Full Record in Web of Science

Like many cultural groups, the Maya of Chiapas are experiencing rapid sociodemographic shifts. Three generations of girls (N = 134) were observed at their looms: in the 1970 subsistence economy; in the transition to a commercial economy in the 1990s; and in 2012, when the commercial economy required formal education. Multilevel models showed that intergenerational sociodemographic change - increased time in school, greater involvement in the money economy, and decreased family size - changed weaving apprenticeship, which, in turn, was related to changes in characteristics of learners. In 2012, weaving learners received more explanations, praise, and body instruction from their teachers. Learners, in turn, asked more questions. However, these changes came at a cost - the gradual loss of weaving as an everyday subsistence practice and art form.

A video-based exploration of classroom practice;RESEARCH IN SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGICAL EDUCATION;;;;;;;;;;;;BackgroundInquiry-based instruction is a prominent teaching strategy in science education that is assumed to be an effective means to foster not only students' understanding of science content but also their procedural and epistemic knowledge concerning inquiry processes. Empirical studies have repeatedly shown that inquiry-related activities should be combined with instruction that explicitly addresses procedural and epistemic knowledge to support students' learning effectively.PurposeThe aim of this study is to explore to what extent explicit instruction on procedural and epistemic knowledge is occurring in inquiry-based biology and chemistry lessons.SampleThe sample analysed in this study consist of 16 inquiry-based biology and chemistry lessons recorded in German classrooms.Design and MethodsThe video recordings of the lessons were analysed in three steps. First, event-based codes were used to identify all phases of a lesson in which students were engaged in an inquiry-related activity (e.g. developing questions, planning investigations). Second, each phase was analysed with respect to features of explicit instruction (e.g. explications of inquiry strategies). Third, event-based codes were used to capture individual features of explicit instruction in a phase.ResultsIn our sample explicit instruction on procedural knowledge occurred rarely and mostly in the form of brief sidenotes rather than as a comprehensive and deliberately planned action. Furthermore, explicit instruction on epistemic knowledge was virtually non-existent. However, we observed that many tasks and questions that are given by the teachers during their lessons have a high potential for making procedural (and epistemic) aspects explicit.ConclusionWhile this explorative study does not allow for causal explanations for the lack of explicit instruction, its findings provide important insights into classroom practice.

We draw on the relatively new field of data science as a multi-disciplinary approach to investigate problems through analysis of massive, non-standard, incongruous and/or messy data. Our exploratory qualitative study had as its research question: What can children learn about citizenship when they engage with data science? The case study in this paper illustrated ways that children's learning about citizenship were enriched through an age-appropriate data science investigation. The study analysed classroom video from a Year 4 classroom (aged 9-10) over six lessons that integrated curricula in digital technologies, health, and mathematics. In these lessons, the children generated and analysed non-standard data and debated social, well-being and privacy issues as they considered their activities in cyberspace. The video data were analysed using a framework based on critical citizenship education literature that examined dimensions of power, collective engagement, individual responsibility and action. Three key findings emerged. First, the case study highlighted skills in citizenship education developed through data science, positioning children as agents and advocates. Second, the study showed how a complex data investigation in citizenship education was achievable with primary children through meaningful curriculum integration. This is important given that problems that citizens address are typically interdisciplinary. Finally, the findings revealed a gap between data science skills and those developed in the mathematics curriculum, and recommend ways that the maths curriculum could be updated.;;;;;Makar, Katie/B-8648-2012;"Makar, Katie/0000-0002-4707-8898; Fry, Kym/0000-0002-7318-4117";;;;;;;;;;;;;1863-9690;1863-9704;;;;2023 JAN 2;2023;;;;;;;;;;10.1007/s11858-022-01450-7;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11858-022-01450-7;;JAN 2023;;;;;;36619684;;;;;WOS:000906602000001;View Full Record in Web of Science

In dual language bilingual education (DLBE) preschool programs, teachers utilize translanguaging practices to facilitate communication, scaffold learning, and encourage participation. Using a sustainable translanguaging lens, we explore English- and Spanish-language model teachers' pedagogical choices in Show-and-Tell in support of children's Show-and-Tell purposes and practices. Video data were analyzed for discourse- and content-related codes to examine teachers' discursive and translanguaging choices and presenters' languaging practices during Show-and-Tell. Qualitative analyses revealed that teachers' translanguaging choices vary in response to the language context (i.e. teacher's designated language of instruction and the target language of the Show-and-Tell) and to children's languaging practices (i.e. choice of language, amount of unprompted talk, purpose of presentation, degree of peer involvement). Given the vulnerable status of Spanish as the minoritized language in an English-majority culture, teachers sustained the use and modeling of Spanish in Spanish Show-and-Tell while integrating Spanish as a supportive resource in English Show-and-Tell. Findings suggest implications for how teachers can protect minoritized languages within DLBE preschool programs while valuing children's authentic translanguaging practices and building on children's understanding language functions and forms in each language.;;;;;Bengochea, Alain/I-4310-2019;Bengochea, Alain/0000-0002-4602-3676;;;;;;;;;;;;;1367-0050;1747-7522;;;;SEP 14;2023;26;8;;;SI;;928;942;;10.1080/13670050.2022.2161814;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13670050.2022.2161814;;JAN 2023;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000908905100001;View Full Record in Web of Science

An adapted version of the Early Child-hood Teacher Behaviour Observation (ECTBO) instrument was used to investigate the possible reasons for teachers' current behaviours in Hong Kong visual arts classrooms. In an observation study, a total of 18 classrooms with 76 children in two local kindergartens in Hong Kong were observed during a 30-min visual arts activity. Altogether, 540 min of video data were recorded and analysed using field notes and a time sampling strategy. In addition, 18 class teachers from the observed classrooms were invited to give post-observation interviews, and 810 min of data were recorded. The interview participants supported the importance of non-directive early childhood arts. However, the observation findings revealed that they still relied heavily on directive teaching in implementing early visual arts teaching. Thus, a discrepancy was found between the teachers' subject matter knowledge in visual arts and the integration of their pedagogies in their actual classroom practice. The findings of this study in a local setting have the potential to significantly change the way in which early childhood visual arts teaching is conceptualised and discussed in international contexts.(c) 2023 The Authors.

In this qualitative case study, over a period of 16 weeks, video data were collected during making activities in an advanced placement science course with 19 pupils aged 12-16 years, and interviews were conducted. We combined thematic and interaction analyses of empirical data and identified three themes: 1) engagement and spontaneous concepts, 2) programming and making physical objects, and 3) subject integration. Our conceptual framework for the analyses integrated two features of the Vygotskian sociocul-tural theory of learning: concept development as a dialectical process of scientific and everyday concepts and the tool and symbol duality. Our findings show that both top-down and bottom-up approaches to integrating school subjects into a makerspace were effective but underused. We illustrate this by mapping pupils' shared understanding in a sociotechnical space, visualized as a process of rising to the concrete, which may require teacher's scaffolding at different levels of abstraction and use of instructional materials in different modalities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2210-6561;2210-657X;;;;APR;2023;39;;;;;;;;100697;10.1016/j.lcsi.2023.100697;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lcsi.2023.100697;;FEB 2023;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000997431900001;View Full Record in Web of Science
J;"Troll, B; Pietsch, M; Besser, M";;;;"Troll, Bianka; Pietsch, Marcus; Besser, Michael";;;Behavioral engagement in classroom - An analysis of the generalizability and dependability of video observations;ZEITSCHRIFT FUR PADAGOGISCHE PSYCHOLOGIE;;;;;;;;;;;;This student-centered video study examines the generalizability and reliability of video observations of behavioral engagement of students, taking into account the active work phases (partner work, group work, plenary) of a third year primary school class (N = 20 students). We used an adapted version of the Munich Attention Inventory (Helmke & Renkl, 1992) to assess the behavioral engagement of all learners during the active work phases in one-second intervals by four independent raters. In educational psychology, video studies are often used to describe and analyze classroom processes - although they are considered as being very resource-intensive and costly. Therefore, in order to enable efficient and economical design planning of studies this study investigates up to how many seconds the behavioral engagement of students can be reliably observed. In line with our expectations, the results of the G-Study show that individual learners variance explanation was 18.85% across all work phases. The time in seconds (2.67%) explains only a marginal part of the variance. There remains a large proportion of unexplained residual variance (78.48%). The reliability coefficient with f = .99 is very good due to common standards. The decision study (D-Study) shows that results are reliable even when observing just 30 seconds (f = .87). The results indicate that student-centered video analyses offer a valuable way to capture the behavioral engagement of all students, in that information on all learners is available throughout the entire lesson. The results also contribute to an economic design of student-centered video studies on behavioral engagement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1010-0652;1664-2910;;;;APR;2023;37;3;;;;;157;171;;10.1024/1010-0652/a000286;http://dx.doi.org/10.1024/1010-0652/a000286;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000978980900001;View Full Record in Web of Science
J;"Ferdig, RE; Kosko, KW; Gandolfi, E";;;;"Ferdig, Richard E.; Kosko, Karl W.; Gandolfi, Enrico";;;Exploring the relationships between teacher noticing, ambisonic audio, and variance in focus when viewing 360 video;ETR&D-EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT;;;;;;;;;;;;A growing body of research has supported the implementation of innovative and immersive video for teaching and learning across the lifespan. Immersive video, delivered through eXtended Reality (XR) tools like 360 video, provides users with new ways to see real or created environments. Unfortunately, most of the existing research has highlighted immersive video without accompanying immersive audio. This use of monophonic audio can create a disconnect for viewers as they experience close to real world video with sounds that do not match a real-world environment. The purpose of this study was to respond to this gap in the literature by exploring the use of ambisonic audio and its impact on preservice teacher noticing and variability of viewing focus when watching 360 video. Data were collected from undergraduate teacher education students who participated in a self-paced online activity that included watching 360 videos and responding to a questionnaire. A convergent mixed methods design was employed to compare participants' professional noticing and observed viewing behavior in the context of ambisonic and monophonic audio. Results showed that users in ambisonic audio conditions in 360 video environments were more likely to have higher focus. Moreover, for users who had specific professional knowledge, monophonic audio with immersive video had a negative impact on their variance in focus. The paper concludes with recommendations for future research on the use of audio in virtual and augmented reality environments.;;;;;Kosko, Karl Wesley/HSH-8446-2023;Kosko, Karl Wesley/0000-0002-6060-0345;;;;;;;;;;;;;1042-1629;1556-6501;;;;JUN;2023;71;3;;;;;881;899;;10.1007/s11423-023-10215-2;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11423-023-10215-2;;APR 2023;;;;;;37359490;;;;;WOS:000962990100001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Hence, it illustrates the ways the video data were used in the focus group elicitation interviews to understand their interpretations of how their beliefs align with a hypothetical future scenario around artificial intelligence. To demonstrate the phenomenon in depth, a case study design was used. The participants of the study involved 45 third and fourth-year undergraduate students enrolled in a science teacher education programme. For this study, the researcher conducted six open-ended, unstructured video-elicitation focus group interviews. The data was analysed using Dey's (1993. Qualitative data analysis: A user-friendly guide for social scientists. Routledge) qualitative analysis steps of description, qualification, and association. The findings indicated that the participants' views and reasoning vary in the context of artificial intelligence technologies. The fictional scenario depicted in the video-elicitation interviews both helped and challenged them to share their perspectives on the issue. Moreover, several aspects of SSI were thoroughly discussed during the interviews.;;;;;Karahan, Engin/ABD-3114-2021;Karahan, Engin/0000-0003-4530-211X;;;;;;;;;;;;;0950-0693;1464-5289;;;;2023 APR 18;2023;;;;;;;;;;10.1080/09500693.2023.2200887;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09500693.2023.2200887;;APR 2023;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000975976100001;View Full Record in Web of Science

This study aimed to develop a training and implementation protocol for the widely used Facial Expression Coding System (FACES) to be used in real-world settings with pre-recorded video data. A revised coding system with supplemental guidelines and training procedures was developed to use FACES with video data recorded in special education classrooms. This system resulted in adequate interrater reliability as well as reduced training time for coders. Specific training methods included close study of code definitions, coding of practice video, quantitative analysis of observation data to generate interrater agreement and kappa statistics, review of comparison charts to identify discrepancies between coder and training observations using the Noldus Observer XT software, and post-observation discussions. The revised FACES protocol and new training method presented here offer a more robust, efficient, and versatile tool that can be applied to systematic behavior observations conducted of students in real-world classroom settings.;;;;;;Flynn, Erin/0000-0002-3696-1335;;;;;;;;;;;;;0165-0254;1464-0651;;;;JUL;2023;47;4;;;;;366;373;;10.1177/01650254231167313;http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/01650254231167313;;APR 2023;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000983407700001;View Full Record in Web of Science
J;Tiong, ND;;;;Tiong, Ngee Derk;;;Negotiating frame disputes in teacher discourse: vignettes of accountability and opportunities for learning;PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN EDUCATION;;;;;;;;;;;;The on-the-job collaborative discourse of teachers is said to offer promising insights into the implicit processes of teacher learning and socialisation (Lefstein et al. 2020). Building on existing theory and research, this article examines diagnostic frame disputes in teachers' discussions that involve the negotiation of contradictions between external expectations and teachers' own frames of reference. This phenomenon is illustrated using two purposively-sampled vignettes, drawn from video data generated in two Malaysian secondary schools in 2019. In both vignettes, teachers work to reconcile the discrepancies between how student learning problems are framed by external accountability measures, as well as how the teachers interpret those problems locally, leading to disputes about how to frame those problems. The analysis presents an empirical illustration of how teachers negotiate situated meaning, shedding light on how they interpret and respond to accountability pressures on their practice. Implications for policy and practice are discussed.;;;;;Tiong, Ngee Derk/HLW-8284-2023;Tiong, Ngee Derk/0000-0001-8396-2747;;;;;;;;;;;;;1941-5257;1941-5265;;;;JUL 4;2023;49;4;;;SI;;765;780;;10.1080/19415257.2023.2203156;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19415257.2023.2203156;;APR 2023;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000975890600001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Multiple raters used a high-inference categorical scheme on 36 sessions. Our research questions concern the types of student mistakes, clinical teachers' reactions to them and if they use different strategies to address different types of mistakes. We used a Poisson model and generalized mixed models to analyse these research questions. Most frequently, students made reproduction mistakes. Relatively high rates of rejection and a similar prevalence of low and high levels of elaboration and correction time for students were observed. Reproduction mistakes were associated with the highest level of rejection and the lowest level of elaboration. High levels of elaboration were observed when students were applying skills in new situations. Students were most often allowed time to correct when mistakes in the areas of analysis or application of skills and knowledge had occurred. There is a decrease in the rate of making mistakes for neurology and orthopaedics compared to internal medicine. Reproduction mistakes influence significantly the outcome feedback compared to application mistakes. Analytic and reproduction mistakes influence elaboration significantly compared to application mistakes. We found a significant effect whether the lecturer allows time for correction of reproduction mistakes compared to application mistakes. These results contribute to the understanding of interactive, patient-centred clinical teaching as well as student mistakes and how teachers are reacting to them. Our descriptive findings provide an empirical basis for clinical teachers to react to student mistakes in didactically fruitful ways.;;;;;"; Fuetterer, Cornelia/K-5848-2018";"Gartmeier, Martin/0000-0002-5025-0003; Blaschke, Anna-Lena/0000-0002-1111-0905; Rubisch, Hannah Paula Katharina/0000-0001-5477-5432; Haller, Bernhard/0000-0002-9723-393X; Fuetterer, Cornelia/0000-0002-8354-6660";;;;;;;;;;;;;1382-4996;1573-1677;;;;2023 MAY 11;2023;;;;;;;;;;10.1007/s10459-023-10233-y;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10459-023-10233-y;;MAY 2023;;;;;;37170035;;;;;WOS:000985243300001;View Full Record in Web of Science

While much of this existing research is based on international large-scale assessment studies, we still lack a clear understanding of the factors that influence the quality of inquiry-based science teaching in actual classroom practices. In this paper, we operationalise teaching quality through an observation manual, and we drew on this manual to systematically analyse video data of instructional practices in 20 Norwegian science classrooms at the primary and lower-secondary school level (73 observed lessons and about 450 students). We identified varying quality in the individual inquiry phases and differences between primary and lower-secondary schools. We observed that primary-school students collected and documented data more systematically than lower-secondary students and that consolidations were slightly more emphasised and of higher quality at the lower-secondary than at the primary level. Moreover, our findings indicate that inquiry-based teaching gave students more freedom to make their own choices and increased the quality of student participation in the classroom. Based on our findings, we discuss how teachers can improve the quality of inquiry-based instruction and empower students in the classroom.;;;;;;Kersting, Magdalena/0000-0003-3568-8397;;;;;;;;;;;;;0950-0693;1464-5289;;;;2023 MAY 17;2023;;;;;;;;;;10.1080/09500693.2023.2213386;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09500693.2023.2213386;;MAY 2023;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000990427600001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Good for teachers?;BRITISH EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH JOURNAL;;;;;;;;;;;;Should teachers have complete autonomy over teaching methods and practices, or should some aspects of their practice be determined by school or government policy? We address this question using repeated (value-added) maths test scores linked to rich survey data from the TALIS video study. With the possible exception of inexperienced teachers, we generally find no relationship between teacher autonomy and pupil outcomes (test scores, maths self-efficacy or interest in maths). In partial contrast with our findings for pupil outcomes, teachers with very low levels of autonomy are more likely to report reduced job satisfaction. It may hence be that some level of restriction on teacher autonomy is justified, especially among inexperienced teachers, particularly when it represents only partial control of teachers' approaches in the classroom and is done to introduce evidence-based methods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0141-1926;1469-3518;;;;2023 JUL 12;2023;;;;;;;;;;10.1002/berj.3892;http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/berj.3892;;JUL 2023;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001028217000001;View Full Record in Web of Science
J;Tang, KS;;;;Tang, Kok-Sing;;;Exploring the materiality of science learning: analytical frameworks for examining interactions with material objects in science meaning-making;RESEARCH IN SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGICAL EDUCATION;;;;;;;;;;;;BackgroundWith a growing new materialism paradigm and research on multimodality, there is an increasing attention on the role of material objects in science teaching and learning. However, there is currently no available framework, coding scheme, or method of inquiry to specifically analyze the use of material objects in science meaning-making.PurposeThis paper presents and discusses two analytical frameworks developed to examine teachers' and students' interaction with material objects during classroom discourse.Design and methodsThe first analytical framework was theoretically informed by multimodal interaction analysis (MIA), focusing on humans' situated interaction using embodied and disembodied modes located in the material world. The second framework was informed by social semiotics multimodal analysis (SSMA), focusing on material interaction as a semiotic mode with unique affordances for sign-makers to make meaning alongside other semiotic modes (e.g. speech, gesture).SampleBoth frameworks are used to analyze two vignettes of classroom discourse generated from video data to illustrate their applications, coding procedures, and interpretative potential.ResultsThe MIA-informed framework highlighted the dynamic and reciprocal relations between students' experiences and the transformation of materials, while the SSMA-informed framework highlighted the subtle meanings constructed with the unique affordances of the material mode.ConclusionThe affordances and limitations of the two frameworks are discussed, along with their compatibility and complementary relations. This work contributes to the emerging field of materiality in science education research and provides a foundation for future studies on the analysis of material interaction in science meaning-making.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0263-5143;1470-1138;;;;2023 JUL 13;2023;;;;;;;;;;10.1080/02635143.2023.2232307;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02635143.2023.2232307;;JUL 2023;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001026764900001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Existing operationalizations of these dimensions have mostly used comprehensive ratings that combine various subdimensions of task quality and interaction quality. The current study disentangles interaction quality in a video data corpus study (of 49 middle school classrooms sharing the same tasks) to identify those quality features that predict students' learning gains in conceptual understanding. The regression analysis reveals that quality features of students' individual engagement do not predict individual student learning, whereas teachers' support of learning content-relevant vocabulary predicts the small groups' learning. For at-risk students, the collective time spent on conceptual practices (i.e. explaining meanings of concepts) on students' learning is significantly predictive. The observation that different operationalizations (for similar aspects of interaction quality) lead to different impacts on the learning gains contributes to ongoing research efforts to refine and increase insight into aspects of interaction quality.;;;;;;Prediger, Susanne/0000-0001-6541-259X;;;;;;;;;;;;;1571-0068;1573-1774;;;;2023 AUG 1;2023;;;;;;;;;;10.1007/s10763-023-10389-4;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10763-023-10389-4;;AUG 2023;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001040130700001;View Full Record in Web of Science

However, one of the challenges faced during such observation is the strenuous task of coding large amounts of video data through repeated viewings. In this research, we confirm the possibilities of classifying students' learning behavior using data obtained from multimodal distribution. We employed computer algorithms to classify students' learning behavior in animated programming classrooms and used information from this classification to predict learning outcomes. Specifically, our study indicates the presence of three clusters of students in the domain of stay active, stay passive, and to-passive. We also found a relationship between these profiles and learning outcomes. We discussed our findings in accordance with the engagement and instructional quality models and believed that our statistical approach will support the ongoing refinement of the models in the context of behavioral profiling and classroom interaction. We recommend that further studies should identify different epistemological frames in diverse classroom settings to provide sufficient explanations of students' learning processes.;;;;;"Md Noor, Norah/K-6415-2012; Yusuf, Abdullahi/AAR-4510-2021";"Md Noor, Norah/0000-0003-0051-0230; Yusuf, Abdullahi/0000-0003-2487-0564";;;;;;;;;;;;;1360-2357;1573-7608;;;;2023 AUG 9;2023;;;;;;;;;;10.1007/s10639-023-12079-8;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10639-023-12079-8;;AUG 2023;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001045121400005;View Full Record in Web of Science

This article explores how, as an institutional space, the early childhood education and care (ECEC) setting is (re)produced within young children's encounters with others during a transition period. Video-recorded observations of three infant-toddlers' first months of attendance to an ECEC setting were analysed following analytic induction and video interaction analysis. Two examples illustrating object ownership negotiations are discussed. The results show that, in their encounters with others, newcomers actively contributed to (re)producing the ECEC setting by advancing their own understandings of objects and ownership, practicing their own ways of being with objects. Moreover, the results indicate that teachers' contributions strongly influenced the outcomes of the encounters and, consequently, the constitution of shared understandings of objects and object ownership within the ECEC setting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1350-293X;1752-1807;;;;AUG 24;2023;;;;;;;;;2250588;10.1080/1350293X.2023.2250588;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1350293X.2023.2250588;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001054445700001;View Full Record in Web of Science
