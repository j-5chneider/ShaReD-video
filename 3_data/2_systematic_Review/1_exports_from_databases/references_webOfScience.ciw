DE ESDS qualidata; qualitative methodology; reusing qualitative data;

AB Recent interest by social scientists in the questions posed by reusing qualitative data has been prompted by two related events. The first is the establishment of the Qualitative Data Archival Resource Centre ( QUALIDATA, and, since 2003, ESDS Qualidata) at the University of Essex in 1994. The second is the publication of the Economic and Social Research Council ( ESRC) Datasets Policy ( 1996) which asks that those in receipt of ESRC grants offer copies of their data for deposit to QUALIDATA. This perceived injunction to archive data has been met with resistance by recalcitrant researchers who are wary of the implications of depositing data, and the possibilities of reusing data. The debate risks becoming polarised between those advocating the archiving and reuse of qualitative data, and those more sceptical of these possibilities. This paper aims to open up this debate and to seek a more fruitful path between these positions. I begin by calling into question the supposed 'newness' of reusing qualitative data, through turning to examine some of the assumptions embedded in the key terms and premises of the debate thus far, including the reliance on distinctions between primary and secondary data and primary and secondary analysis. I examine some common tropes in accounts of reusing data: comparisons with secondary analysis of quantitative data; efforts to distinguish between reusing qualitative data in a sociological context and other disciplinary and methodological traditions; and reliance on particular interpretations of key principles of qualitative research, context and reflexivity, in establishing the challenges of the reusing of qualitative data. I suggest that reuse may be more productively understood as a process of recontextualising data, and that attending to the reflexive production of data in the contemporary research project may offer more hopeful possibilities for reuse. I conclude by offering some reflections on why discussions of reusing qualitative data appear to have become so fraught.

AB This article is written to accompany and respond to the articles that form the special issue of Sociological Research Online on 'Re-using qualitative data'. It argues that the articles are a welcome contribution, because they help to move the debate beyond moralistic and polarised positions, to demonstrate instead what sociologists can achieve by 're-using' qualitative data. The article argues for an investigative epistemology and investigative practices to guide qualitative data use and 're-use', and suggests that this is particularly important in the current social research climate.

AB This paper considers current debates about re-using qualitative research data by reflecting on its implications for the nature of social science knowledge created in this process and the ways in which the disclosure of researchers' practices are linked with the making of professional academic careers. It examines a research project using two different approaches -a 'virtual' and a 'classic' ethnography to argue that issues concerned with re-use of data depend on the methods employed and the overall processes of investigation. The paper argues for an appreciation of the contexts involved in the generation of research material which takes into account both the development of the study and related fieldwork processes as well as the academic context in which knowledge is produced, particularly those involved in the construction of academic selves and professional careers, which are part of a wider situation bearing upon scientific enquiry.

AB Open data sharing and re-use is currently more common in some academic disciplines than others. Although each discipline has unique challenges and characteristics which can influence data sharing and re-use behavior, it may be possible to gain transferable insight from disciplines where these practices are more common. Several studies of the motivations underlying data sharing and re-use have been conducted, however these studies often remain at a high level of abstraction rather than providing in-depth insight about discipline-specific challenges and opportunities. This study sought to provide in-depth insight about the complex interaction of factors influencing motivations for sharing and re-using open research data within a single discipline, namely astrophysics. We focused on this discipline due to its well-developed tradition of free and open access to research data. Eight factors were found to influence researchers' motivations for sharing data openly, including the researcher's background, personal drivers, experience, legislation, regulation and policy, data characteristics, performance expectancy, usability, and collaboration. We identified six factors that influence researchers' motivations to re-use open research data, including the researcher's background, facilitating conditions, expected performance, social and affiliation factors, effort and experience. Finally, we discuss how data sharing and re-use can be encouraged within the context of astrophysics research, and we discuss how these insights may be transferred to disciplines with low rates of data sharing and re-use.

The articles address the use of digital sources in qualitative research in both research and teaching, charting types of use over the past 10 years, and looking forward to emerging practices and methods, such as the promise and potential that technological innovations can bring to enable new ways of presenting and publishing qualitative research. Some of the papers make use of direct linking allowing the reader to explore "live" data sources, offering an opportunity to see how research transparency might be operationalized in the presentation of qualitative findings and reporting. The papers reference major contributions to the literature and present stimulating debates on the topic and build on previously well-cited publications in which the editors have presented state-of-the-art articles on secondary analysis of qualitative data.

DE Re-Use of Qualitative Data; Secondary Analysis; Qualitative Data
   Archiving; Constructionism
AB The potential gains and practical problems associated with secondary analysis of qualitative data have received increasing attention in recent years. The discussions display conflicting attitudes, some commentators emphasising the difficulties while others emphasise the benefits. In a few recent contributions the distinctiveness of re-using data has come to be questioned, on the grounds that the problems identified with it - of data not fitting the research questions, and of relevant contextual knowledge being absent - are by no means limited to secondary analysis. There has also been a more fundamental claim: to the effect that these problems are much less severe once we recognise that, all data are constituted and re-constituted within the research process. In this article I examine these arguments, concluding that while they have much to commend them, they do not dissolve the problems of 'fit' and 'context'.

AB We describe a pilot project designed to assess the feasibility of re-use across 12 diverse qualitative datasets related to Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) in the UK, from research projects undertaken between 1997 and 2013 - an approach which is chronically underused. First, we consider the sweeping biomedical changes and imperatives relating to HIV in this time frame, offering a rationale for data re-use at this point in the epidemic. We then reflexively situate the processes and procedures we devised for this study with reference to relevant methodological literature. Hammersley's and Leonelli's contributions have been particularly instructive through this process, and following their lead, we conclude with further considerations for those undertaking qualitative data re-use, reflecting on the extent to which qualitative data re-use as a practice requires attention to both thegivenand theconstructedaspects of data when assembled as evidence.

AB This paper explores the challenges arising from the 're-use' of Mass Observation Project (MOP) writing (1981 to present day) encountered by the authors when setting up an Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) funded, longitudinal, mixed-methods research project on civic engagement. The paper begins with a brief review of the present UK social science research environment, highlighting the evidence for an increasing Research Council focus on interdisciplinary research and secondary analysis/re-use of data. It argues that this shift in focus gives rise to unique methodological challenges such as those encountered by the authors in this project. After providing some background and context, the paper discusses different obstacles encountered in the course of setting up this project. These include difficulties in: communicating within and across disciplines; re-using data across disciplines; the use of metadata, and its role in choosing writers from a longitudinal secondary data source; choice of analytical tools and approaches; and the Mass Observation writer's role in the research process. By sharing these experiences, the paper seeks to enable potential users of the MOP to see the value of MOP as a source of longitudinal qualitative secondary data; appreciate its potential for use with other data sources and across different disciplines; and equip other researchers to meet some of the challenges that the longitudinal use of MOP writing throws up.

AB BackgroundIncreasing adoption of electronic health records in hospitals provides new opportunities for patient data to support public health advances. Such learning healthcare models have generated ethical debate in high-income countries, including on the role of patient and public consent and engagement. Increasing use of electronic health records in low-middle income countries offers important potential to fast-track healthcare improvements in these settings, where a disproportionate burden of global morbidity occurs. Core ethical issues have been raised around the role and form of information sharing processes for learning healthcare systems, including individual consent and individual and public general notification processes, but little research has focused on this perspective in low-middle income countries.MethodsWe conducted a qualitative study on the role of information sharing and governance processes for inpatient data re-use, using in-depth interviews with 34 health stakeholders at two public hospitals on the Kenyan coast, including health managers, providers and researchers. Data were collected between March and July 2016 and analysed using a framework approach, with Nvivo 10 software to support data management.ResultsMost forms of clinical data re-use were seen as an important public health good. Individual consent and general notification processes were often argued as important, but contingent on interrelated influences of the type of data, use and secondary user. Underlying concerns were linked to issues of patient privacy and autonomy; perceived risks to trust in health systems; and fairness in how data would be used, particularly for non-public sector re-users. Support for engagement often turned on the anticipated outcomes of information-sharing processes, as building or undermining trust in healthcare systems.ConclusionsAs reported in high income countries, learning healthcare systems in low-middle counties may generate a core ethical tension between supporting a public good and respecting patient autonomy and privacy, with the maintenance of public trust acting as a core requirement. While more evidence is needed on patient and public perspectives on learning healthcare activities, greater collaboration between public health and research governance systems is likely to support the development of efficient and locally responsive learning healthcare activities in LMICs.

AB This paper provides an overview of secondary analysis of qualitative data, based on work examining the nature and use of the methodology in social research. It clarifies what secondary analysis is and how the methodology relates to other similar approaches used in qualitative research. It looks at the development of secondary analysis in qualitative research, and some of the factors that have shaped this. And it examines the ways in which researchers have re-used qualitative data in published studies to date, describing which sources of data have been re-used, by whom and for what purposes. As well as reflecting on the ways in which researchers have so far utilized qualitative data in secondary studies, the paper also looks forward to some of the challenges that lie ahead.

AB Secondary analysis of qualitative data is a valid mode of clinical inquiry. However, there is limited information available on its use in nursing. This article describes the use of secondary analysis for a study of family caregivers of relatives with dementia. The advantages, limitations, and application of secondary analysis are outlined; data management, analysis, and rigor are also discussed. The article concludes that this method is cost-effective, decreases respondent burden, and is a useful research method for students. However, the secondary analyst must be aware of the limitations of using secondary analysis of qualitative data.

AB Qualitative Secondary Data Analysis remains severely underutilized in Human Development and Family Sciences (HDFS). In this paper, we revisit the topic of qualitative secondary data analysis, exploring complications and possibilities. Major barriers to qualitative secondary data analysis are archiving data, availability of datasets, and knowledge and explicit models of qualitative data reanalysis. Foregrounding the importance of multilogicality, qualitative secondary data analysis moves away from linear, unidimensional, and restricted analyses and understandings. With exceptions, little published discussion exists about philosophical considerations and analytical tools that could be used for qualitative secondary data analysis within HDFS. In response to this deficit, we offer ideas and examples of qualitative secondary data analyses from our datasets. By reopening this can of words, we hope to (re) generate more discussion and encourage a greater number of HDFS scholars to archive their qualitative datasets and reuse existing qualitative datasets.

AB There is a growing movement for research data to be accessed, used, and shared by multiple stakeholders for various purposes. The changing technological landscape makes it possible to digitally store data, creating opportunity to both share and reuse data anywhere in the world for later use. This movement is growing rapidly and becoming widely accepted as publicly funded agencies are mandating that researchers open their research data for sharing and reuse. While there are numerous advantages to use of open data, such as facilitating accountability and transparency, not all data are created equally. Accordingly, reusing data in qualitative research present some epistemological, methodological, legal, and ethical issues that must be addressed in the movement toward open data. We examine some of these challenges and make a case that some qualitative research data should not be reused in secondary analysis.

AB Shared qualitative data - such as interview or focus group transcripts - can be used for secondary qualitative data analysis (SQDA). Yet, much archived qualitative data remains unused after primary analysis. Applications and guidance on how to employ SQDA are rare. We use an example application of SQDA studying informal institutions and resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa to show: First, SQDA depends on how primary researchers share 'raw' qualitative data and additional documentation to understand primary context. Second, deductive and inductive uses of SQDA require varying engagement with primary data. Third, current practices of participant consent often do not consider potential SQDA. Fourth, SQDA is not less time-consuming than primary data research but offers different benefits, such as expanding the comparative sample of cases or avoiding research fatigue of studied communities. Going forward, SQDA requires greater consensus on the instruments (e.g. transcripts and participant consent forms) used by researchers and further applications of hypothesis-testing and hypothesis-generating designs.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to discuss the challenges of translating qualitative data from Arabic to English within the field of gender and management studies.
   Design/methodology/approach This paper presents a real experience of translating qualitative data from Arabic to English within the management area in Saudi Arabia. Data were collected from interviewing female managers working in the Saudi public sector.
   Findings Translating qualitative data from Arabic to English is not a straightforward process. During the translation of this cross-cultural qualitative research, three challenges were faced: the embeddedness of the language meaning in the culture, positionality and its influence on data production and language differences. The study found that, in absence of a standard way for translating cross-linguistic qualitative research, a combination of methods is found to be useful to increase the validity and reliability of the study findings. Researchers who conduct qualitative insider research and who translate their own data are in a better position to do cross-language data analysis.
   Originality/value This paper contributes to the literature by showing that translating Arabic texts regarding gender, management and leadership is embedded within historical, cultural, political and institutional contexts, requiring a deep understanding of both language and culture to produce a depth of knowledge. Also, the novelty of this study is that it highlights the importance of being an insider qualitative researcher and translating the research data, as researcher offers significant opportunities for close attention to certain points in the text; and this could add value to the analysis as a way to establish validity of interpretations.

AB This article investigates dilemmas in the archiving and sharing of qualitative data in educational research, critically engaging with practices and debates from across the social sciences. Ethical, epistemological and methodological challenges are examined in reference to open access agendas, the politics of knowledge production, and transformations in research practices in the era of data management. We first consider practical and interpretive decisions in archiving qualitative data, then map current policy and regulatory frameworks governing research data management, taking Australia as a case-study. We argue that governance and protocols for data sharing have not attended sufficiently to the distinctive ethical and methodological dimensions and knowledge claims of qualitative research. Instead, approaches associated with quantitative data are extrapolated in ways which construct an imaginary of decontextualised data, abstracted from the conditions of its production. We further argue for more critical attention to the double-edged affordances and ambivalent effects of data sharing and openness and to how data archives are imagined, constructed and curated. This includes greater acknowledgement of the affective and temporal dynamics involved in data archiving, understanding them as practices of (re)invention that also curate 'archives for the future' and help to foster an historicising imaginary in educational research.

AB Qualitative research using interviews is a crucial and established inquiry method in social sciences to ensure that the study outputs represent the researched people and area rather than those who are researching. However, first hand primary data collection is not always possible, often due to external circumstances. Additionally, the use of secondary data, particularly open data, is progressively preferred to increase efficiency and gain geographical breadth. Therefore, this paper proposes a new step-by-step secondary qualitative inquiry methodology for online, publicly available interview data. Such procedural approach can help increase rigor, explicitly consider and mitigate potential pitfalls, and expand the research community's datasets. The 7-step methodology is based on a hybrid approach with elements of pragmatic qualitative approach, discursive grounded theory, and narrative approach and refers to research ethical principles of autonomy, equity, and diversity. One of the proposed steps is data quality assessment, which consists of quality assessment of data context and data content with a total of 16 quality dimensions to filter the collected data. The data analysis method comprises of content analysis for dataset categorization and thematic discourse analysis to answer the pre-set research questions. Additionally, the methodology covers the ethical and legal considerations relating to secondary online data and reporting the research findings of such data. By providing an example in the field of forced migration, we demonstrate how the methodology provides structure when conducting secondary qualitative research.

AB This article argues that navigating the formalized, regulated and institutionalized data sharing landscape is challenging for researchers tasked with making qualitative data available for re-use. Archiving empirical material has progressively become a requirement enshrined in the policies of UK research institutions. Yet, how qualitative researchers feature - as data (co)creators and curators - within a process governed largely by quantitative data management strategies remains undocumented. Using examples from the ESRC Timescapes initiative, this article argues that to advance ethical practice in qualitative secondary analysis (QSA), data sharing policies and practices need to be re-framed to respect, value and care for the particularities of qualitative data and the emotional, intellectual and temporal investments made by qualitative researchers working in an increasingly pressurized Higher Education (HE) environment. Accordingly, ideas from the ethics of care literature are employed to propose areas where 'habits of care', attuned to the needs of qualitative researchers and data, can be fostered.

AB Qualitative data provide rich information on research questions in diverse fields. Recent calls for increased transparency and openness in research emphasize data sharing. However, qualitative data sharing has yet to become the norm internationally and is particularly uncommon in the United States. Guidance for archiving and secondary use of qualitative data is required for progress in this regard. In this study, we review the benefits and concerns associated with qualitative data sharing and then describe the results of a content analysis of guidelines from international repositories that archive qualitative data. A minority of repositories provide qualitative data sharing guidelines. Of the guidelines available, there is substantial variation in whether specific topics are addressed. Some topics, such as removing direct identifiers, are consistently addressed, while others, such as providing an anonymization log, are not. We discuss the implications of our study for education, best practices, and future research.

AB Expectations to share data underlying studies are increasing, but research on how participants, particularly those in qualitative research, respond to requests for data sharing is limited. We studied research participants' willingness to, understanding of, and motivations for data sharing. As part of a larger qualitative study on abortion reporting, we conducted interviews with 64 cisgender women in two states in early 2020 and asked for consent to share de-identified data. At the end of interviews, we asked participants to reflect on their motivations for agreeing or declining to share their data. The vast majority of respondents consented to data sharing and reported that helping others was a primary motivation for agreeing to share their data. However, a substantial number of participants showed a limited understanding of the concept of "data sharing." Additional research is needed on how to improve participants' understanding of data sharing and thus ensure fully informed consent.

AB There has been a significant growth in the infrastructure for archiving and sharing qualitative data, facilitating reuse and secondary analysis. The article explores some issues relating to ethics and epistemology in the conduct of qualitative secondary analysis. It also offers a critical discussion of the importance of engaging with the situatedness and contextually embedded nature of data, and ways in which contexts (including research designs and disciplinary and methodological assumptions) are themselves embedded in primary data. I illustrate some strategies for addressing these matters with reference to analyses of two different areas, drawing on research conducted as part of ESRC Timescapes, and highlight some issues for development research.

AB This article considers the contribution that qualitative software can make to 'opening up' open-ended question ('OEQ') data from surveys. While integrating OEQ data with the analysis of fixed response items is a challenge, it is also an endeavour for which qualitative software offers considerable support. For survey researchers who wish to derive more analytic value from OEQ data, qualitative software can be a useful resource. We profile the systematic use of qualitative software for such purposes, and the procedures and practical considerations involved. The discussion is illustrated by examples derived from a survey dataset relating to environmental risk in the UK.

AB Qualitative data sharing practices in psychology have not developed as rapidly as those in parallel quantitative domains. This is often explained by numerous epistemological, ethical and pragmatic issues concerning qualitative data types. In this article, I provide an alternative to the frequently expressed, often reasonable, concerns regarding the sharing of qualitative human data by highlighting three advantages of qualitative data sharing. I argue that sharing qualitative human data is not by default 'less ethical', 'riskier' and 'impractical' compared with quantitative data sharing, but in some cases more ethical, less risky and easier to manage for sharing because (1) informed consent can be discussed, negotiated and validated; (2) the shared data can be curated by special means; and (3) the privacy risks are mainly local instead of global. I hope this alternative perspective further encourages qualitative psychologists to share their data when it is epistemologically, ethically and pragmatically possible.

AB Data sharing is increasingly perceived to be beneficial to knowledge production, and is therefore increasingly required by federal funding agencies, private funders, and journals. As qualitative researchers are faced with new expectations to share their data, data repositories and academic libraries are working to address the specific challenges of qualitative research data. This article describes how data repositories and academic libraries can partner with researchers to support three challenges associated with qualitative data sharing: (1) obtaining informed consent from participants for data sharing and scholarly reuse, (2) ensuring that qualitative data are legally and ethically shared, and (3) sharing data that cannot be deidentified. This article also describes three continuing challenges of qualitative data sharing that data repositories and academic libraries cannot specifically address-research using qualitative big data, copyright concerns, and risk of decontextualization. While data repositories and academic libraries cannot provide easy solutions to these three continuing challenges, they can partner with researchers and connect them with other relevant specialists to examine these challenges. Ultimately, this article suggests that data repositories and academic libraries can help researchers address some of the challenges associated with ethical and lawful qualitative data sharing.

DT Article
DE archive; research ethics; qualitative data; reuse
AB The objective of this paper is to attempt to move beyond the impasse of ethical objections to reusing qualitative data. In doing so, there is no intention of dismissing the importance of ethical debates, in fact, quite the opposite. The debate about ethical reuse needs to be deepened and broadened. First, the current terrain of research ethics will be summarised and situated in the context of broader philosophical ethical frameworks. In contrast, the debates around ethics of archiving have often been narrowly focused on participants' rights. The framework of debate should be broadened first by recognising other entities traditionally deemed within the scope of research ethics, namely the scholarly community and the public. The second useful broadening of the framework is provided by a deontological ethical stance with its focus on duties. In the final section, this expanded framework will be used to rebut several common ethical arguments against archiving qualitative data: archiving violates confidentiality; informed consent for reusing data is impossible; reusing data violates trust between researcher and participant; and, archiving creates an unacceptably high risk of data misrepresentation. If a more general philosophical debate on ethics has something to contribute, the central message must be that no single ethical claim is incontestable. The conclusion will position these debates in a wider context by asking what is at stake when the boundaries of ethical discourse about sharing data are drawn too narrowly.

AB To date, open science, particularly open data, in psychology has focused on quantitative research. This article aims to explore ethical and practical issues encountered by UK-based psychologists utilising open qualitative datasets. Semi-structured telephone interviews with eight qualitative psychologists were explored using a framework analysis. From the findings, we offer a context-consent meta-framework as a resource to help in the design of studies sharing their data and/or studies using open data. We recommend secondary studies conduct archaeologies of context and consent to examine if the data available are suitable for their research questions. This research is the first we know of in the study of "doing" (or not doing) open science, which could be repeated to develop a longitudinal picture or complemented with additional approaches, such as observational studies of how context and consent are negotiated in preregistered studies and open data.

AB Purpose This research investigated the reuse of Video Records of Practice (VRPs) - i.e. a type of qualitative data documenting teaching and learning in educational settings. It studied how reusers' purposes and experience-level with VRP reuse influence the importance of various VRP selection criteria and how these differ depending on whether the main goal for reuse was research or teaching. It also examined whether two different dimensions of qualitative research - reflexivity and context - were factors in VRP reuse. Design/methodology/approach The study reports on surveys of reusers at four VRP repositories. Questions were based on the literature and interviews with VRP reusers. The response rate was 20.6% (180 of 872 distributed surveys). This paper focused on 126 respondents who affirmatively responded they reused VRPs from a repository. Findings Researchers using VRPs were primarily interested in examining a broad range of processes in education and studying/improving ways to measure differences and growth in education. Reusers with teaching goals were commonly interested in VRPs to engage learners in showing examples/exemplars of - and reflecting on - teaching and learning. These differences between research and teaching led to varied expectations about VRPs, such as the amount of content needed and necessary contextual information to support reuse. Research limitations/implications While repositories focus on exposing content, understanding and communicating certain qualities of that content can help reusers identify VRPs and align goals with selection decisions. Originality/value Although qualitative data are increasingly reused, research has rarely focused on identifying how qualitative data reusers employ selection criteria. This study focused on VRPs as one type of qualitative data and identified the attributes of VRPs that reusers perceived to be important during selection. These will help VRP repositories determine which metadata and documentation meet reusers' goals.

Although qualitative research is rarely published in the high-impact journals that have adopted, or are most likely to adopt, data sharing policies, qualitative researchers who publish work in these and similar venues will likely encounter questions about data sharing within the next few years. The fundamental ways in which qualitative and quantitative data differ should be considered when assessing the extent to which qualitative and mixed methods researchers should be expected to adhere to data sharing policies developed with quantitative studies in mind. We outline several of the most critical concerns below, while also suggesting possible modifications that may help to reduce the probability of unintended adverse consequences and to ensure that the sharing of qualitative data is consistent with ethical standards in research.

AB Secondary analysis of qualitative data entails reusing data created from previous research projects for new purposes. Reuse provides an opportunity to study the raw materials of past research projects to gain methodological and substantive insights. In the past decade, use of the approach has grown rapidly in the United Kingdom to become sufficiently accepted that it must now be regarded as mainstream. Several factors explain this growth: the open data movement, research funders' and publishers' policies supporting data sharing, and researchers seeing benefits from sharing resources, including data. Another factor enabling qualitative data reuse has been improved services and infrastructure that facilitate access to thousands of data collections. The UK Data Service is an example of a well-established facility; more recent has been the proliferation of repositories being established within universities. This article will provide evidence of the growth of data reuse in the United Kingdom and in Finland by presenting both data and case studies of reuse that illustrate the breadth and diversity of this maturing research method. We use two distinct data sources that quantify the scale, types, and trends of reuse of qualitative data: (a) downloads of archived data collections held at data repositories and (b) publication citations. Although the focus of this article is on the United Kingdom, some discussion of the international environment is provided, together with data and examples of reuse at the Finnish Social Science Data Archive. The conclusion summarizes the major findings, including some conjectures regarding what makes qualitative data attractive for reuse and sharing.

AB Many industries collect event data on technical, operational and human factors failures, which include short textual or 'qualitative' reports. These reports, whilst often rich in information about the motives and intentions of staff, offer a particular analysis problem, and consequently they often accumulate in filing cabinets with their potential as decision-making aids unrealized. In this paper we will argue that textual (or verbal) accounts are quite acceptable as evidence in safety management, provided they are dealt with rigorously and systematically. The watchword for what should or should not be accepted into risk models or safety databases is reliability. Reliable data generated from 'the things people say' should not be seen as inherently 'less worthy' than reliable data from any other source. In fact, once reliability is established, frequency output from coded discourse can be treated much as frequencies from any engineered system, and are just as amenable to statistical manipulation. The result of taking the time to analyse such data fully is an integrated risk management system where the 'soft' versus 'hard' data distinction is replaced by a,reliable' versus 'unreliable' data model, this paradigm offering maximum benefit from data collected.

AB Data repositories can support secure data management for multi-institutional and geographically dispersed research teams. Primarily designed to provide secure access, storage, and sharing of quantitative data, limited focus has been given to the unique considerations of data repositories for qualitative research. We share our experiences of using a data repository in a large qualitative nursing research study. Over a 27-month period, data collected by this 15-member team from 83 participants included photos, audio recordings and transcripts of interviews, and field notes. The data repository supported the secure collection, storage, and management of over 1,800 files with data. However, challenges were introduced during analysis that required negotiations about the structure and processes of the data repository. We discuss strengths and limitations of data repositories, and introduce practical strategies for developing a data management plan for qualitative research, which is supported through a data repository.

AB Over the last 30 years, there has been substantial debate about the practical, ethical and epistemological issues uniquely associated with qualitative data sharing. In this paper, we contribute to these debates by examining established data sharing practices in Conversation Analysis (CA). CA is an approach to the analysis of social interaction that relies on audio/video recordings of naturally occurring human interactions and moreover works at a level of detail that presents challenges for assumptions about participant anonymity. Nonetheless, data sharing occupies a central position in both the methodology and the wider academic culture of CA as a discipline and a community. Despite this, CA has largely been ignored in qualitative data sharing debates and discussions. We argue that the methodological traditions of CA present a strong case for the value of qualitative data sharing and offer open data sharing practices that might be usefully adopted in other qualitative approaches.

AB Health services research is multifaceted and impacted by the multiple contexts and stakeholders involved. Hence, large data sets are necessary to fully understand the complex phenomena (e.g., scope of nursing practice) being studied. The management of these large data sets can lead to numerous challenges in establishing trustworthiness of the study. This article reports on strategies utilized in data collection and analysis of a large qualitative study to establish trustworthiness. Specific strategies undertaken by the research team included training of interviewers and coders, variation in participant recruitment, consistency in data collection, completion of data cleaning, development of a conceptual framework for analysis, consistency in coding through regular communication and meetings between coders and key research team members, use of N6 (TM) software to organize data, and creation of a comprehensive audit trail with internal and external audits. Finally, we make eight recommendations that will help ensure rigour for studies with large qualitative data sets: organization of the study by a single person; thorough documentation of the data collection and analysis process; attention to timelines; the use of an iterative process for data collection and analysis; internal and external audits; regular communication among the research team; adequate resources for timely completion; and time for reflection and diversion. Following these steps will enable researchers to complete a rigorous, qualitative research study when faced with large data sets to answer complex health services research questions.

AB This article refers to recent debates about the potential methodological costs and benefits of computer use in qualitative research and about the relationship between methodological approaches (eg. 'Grounded Theory') on the one hand and computer-aided methods of qualitative research on the other. It is argued that the connection between certain computer-aided strategies and methodological approaches is far more loose than is often assumed. Furthermore, the danger of methodological biases and distortion arising from the use of certain software packages is overemphasized in current discussions, as far as basic tasks of textual data management ('coding and retrieval') usually performed by this software are concerned. However, with the development of more advanced and complex coding and retrieval techniques, which are regarded by some authors as tools for 'theory building' in qualitative research, methodological confusion may arise if basic prerequisites of qualitative theory building are not taken into consideration. Therefore, certain aspects of qualitative theory building which are relevant for computer aided methods of textual data management are discussed in the paper.

AB In this article, we explore ethical issues in qualitative secondary analysis through a comparison of the literature with practitioner and participant perspectives. To achieve this, we integrated critical narrative review findings with data from two discussion groups: qualitative researchers and research users/consumers. In the literature, we found that theoretical debate ran parallel to practical action rather than being integrated with it. We identified an important and novel theme of relationships that was emerging from the perspectives of researchers and users. Relationships were significant with respect to trust, sharing data, transparency and clarity, anonymity, permissions, and responsibility. We provide an example of practice development that we hope will prompt researchers to re-examine the issues in their own setting. Informing the research community of research practitioner and user perspectives on ethical issues in the reuse of qualitative data is the first step toward developing mechanisms to better integrate theoretical and empirical work.

AB This research note reports on five online workshops by an international team of scholars, the authors, with shared interests in drug (mis)use. The workshops comprise a novel form of collective international qualitative secondary analysis (iQSA) exploring the possibilities for, and value of, qualitative data reuse across international contexts. These preparatory workshops comprise the preliminary stages of a longer programme of methodological development of iQSA, and we used them to identify what challenges there may be for translating evidence across international contexts, what strategies might be best placed to support or facilitate analytical engagement in this direction, and if possible, what empirical value such exchange might have. We discuss how working across international contexts involved the authors in new 'translational' work to address the challenges of establishing and sharing meaning. Such 'translation' entailed a modest degree of empirical engagement, namely, the casing of empirical examples from our datasets that supported an articulation of our various research studies, a collective interrogation of how, why and which such cases could be used for best translational effect and a collective reflexive engagement with how these cases generated new and novel questions that in turn re-engaged us with our own data in new ways. Descriptions of our datasets, therefore, emerged as multifaceted assemblages of 'expertise' and comprised the evidential bases for new empirical insights, research questions and directions.

   whose philosophical terms?
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ISSUES
LA English
DT Article
DE qualitative research; data preservation and sharing; epistemology
AB Over the past decade, an academic debate has developed surrounding qualitative data preservation and sharing in the social sciences, and has been characterised as one between supporters and opponents of this movement. We reframe the debate by suggesting that so-called 'opponents' are not resistant to the principle of data preservation and sharing, but ambivalent about how this principle is being put into practice. Specifically, qualitative researchers are uneasy about the foundational assumptions underpinning current data preservation and sharing policies and practices. Efforts to address these concerns argue that the inclusion of the 'contexts' of data generation, preservation and reuse will adequately resolve the epistemological concerns held by the qualitative research community. However, these 'solutions' reproduce foundational assumptions by treating 'context' as ontologically separate from, rather than constitutive of, data. The future of qualitative data preservation and sharing in the social sciences is dependent on shedding its implicit unitary foundational model of qualitative research, and embracing 'epistemic pluralism' and the diversity of philosophical perspectives representing the qualitative researcher community.

ID SECONDARY ANALYSIS; CONSUMPTION; IDENTITY
AB Though secondary analysis of qualitative data is becoming more prevalent, relatively few methodological studies exist that provide reflection on the actual, not idealised, process. This paper offers a reflexive account of secondary analysis focused on the topic of convenience food and choice. Several phases of the research process are examined: understanding context, defining a subject area, finding data and sampling, later sampling and topic refinement, and relating to transcripts. For each phase, I explore if reusing data is different from using it in the first instance, and if so, how those differences manifest themselves. The paper closes with reflections on the differences, similarities, and relationships between primary and secondary analysis of qualitative data. Although differences exist regarding the researcher-respondent relationship, primary and secondary analyses are more alike than not. The suitability of each approach can only be assessed in light of a particular research question.

TI Using secondary analysis of qualitative data of patient experiences of
   health care to inform health services research and policy
SO JOURNAL OF HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH & POLICY
LA English
DT Article
DE health policy; qualitative interviews; secondary analysis
AB Qualitative research is recognized as an important method for including patients' voices and experiences in health services research and policy-making, yet the considerable potential to analyse existing qualitative data to inform health policy and practice has been little realized. This failure may partly be explained by: a lack of awareness amongst health policy makers of the increasing wealth of qualitative data available; and around 15 years of internal debates among qualitative researchers on the strengths, limitations and validity of re-use of qualitative data. Whilst acknowledging the challenges of qualitative secondary data analysis, we argue that there is a growing imperative to be pragmatic and to undertake analysis of existing qualitative data collections where they have the potential to contribute to health policy formulation. Time pressures are inherent in the policy-making process and in many circumstances it is not possible to seek funding, conduct and analyse new qualitative studies of patients' experiences in time to inform a specific policy. The danger then is that the patient voice, and the experiences of relatives and carers, is either excluded or included in a way that is easily dismissed as 'unrepresentative'. We argue that secondary analysis of qualitative data collections may sometimes be an effective means to enable patient experiences to inform policy decision-making.

AB This paper addresses two interrelated questions concerning what interview data are and how researchers might use them. The first considers the value of a shift from a predominant or exclusive focus upon how data are constructed and produced at interview, and towards how such data might be apprehended through different forms ofengagement. The second question relates to how and what qualitative secondary analysis (QSA) might be used to tell about the social world. In exploring this, we advance a critique of the divide between primary and secondary analysis, recasting the debate in terms of different degrees and qualities of 'proximity' and 'distance' from the formative contexts of data generation, and the distinctive analytical affordances that relate to these. Using QSA of interview data from a study of problem internet gambling as an empirical crucible, we consider the kinds of participation that interviewees develop through reciprocal engagement with interviewers. We illustrate how participants reflexively negotiate the affordances and limits to the narratives through which they frame and recount their experiences. Finally, we show how interview data can be used both to speak of the temporal, relational, spatial, epistemic contexts of their production, and also to contexts and questions beyond these.

ID CONVERSATION ANALYSIS; INTERPRETATIVE REPERTOIRES; DISCOURSE ANALYSIS;
   POSTSTRUCTURALISM; DIALOGUE; CONTEXT
AB In contrast to survey interviews, qualitative interviews are seldom reanalyzed. Besides obvious reasons such as ownership - and especially the culture of individualistic ownership - that impede reusing data, there is also methodological skepticism about secondary analysis. In this paper, I will argue in favor of sharing qualitative data on behalf of secondary analysis. The argument is partly based on - and much inspired by - the discussions during the preparation of a collaborative project of thirteen researchers who were invited to analyze the same set of interview data from their own theoretical/methodological viewpoint (VAN DEN BERG, WETHERELL & HOUTKOOP-STEENSTRA, 2003). During these discussions several methodological arguments against secondary analysis were put forward. In this paper I will deal with some of these arguments, especially the doubts about the usefulness of secondary analysis and the argument concerning the assumed risk of decontextualization: Is secondary analysis possible without in-depth knowledge of the context? Different theoretical and methodological positions concerning the contextualization of interview discourse will be scrutinized. On the one hand I argue against the tendency to include the ever-widening societal and historical context on behalf of the analysis of interview discourse. This tendency runs the risk of speculative social theorizing as a framework for interpreting interview discourse. On the other hand I do not think that the neglect of every social context outside interview talk - as advocated by some strands within conversation analysis - is fruitful or even possible. This neglect runs the risk of abstract empiricism. The main argument is that the kind and measure of contextualization of interview data needed on behalf of discourse analysis should depend on the research goal and the type of data.

ID ENERGY-CONSERVATION; IMPACT SCALE; STRATEGIES; PROGRAM; PEOPLE
AB Combining qualitative inquiry with quantitative frequency data in a mixed methods research approach was valuable in understanding the strategies that people with Multiple Sclerosis ( MS) used to manage their fatigue. Understanding its management is important because fatigue is often described by people with MS as their most disabling symptom and can pervade all aspects of a person's life. This research aimed to identify how often people used particular fatigue management strategies and the factors that influenced their use in the context of daily life. The methodology was Qualitative Description with phenomenological overtones using convenience sampling, interviews with semi-structured and structured components, and frequencies combined with typology development. Thirty-one people with MS from Chicago, Ill and Brisbane, Queensland in Australia who experienced fatigue were interviewed and asked to sort 15 cards with common fatigue management strategies into 3 categories, indicating whether they used them regularly, sometimes or never. Frequency counts were used to identify the number of participants who placed a specific strategy in a particular category. Frequencies were used to develop a typology with which to code the qualitative data. The strategies placed most frequently in each category were: Plan / organize the day used regularly, Ask someone for help used sometimes, and Use mobility devices never used. Mixed methods research techniques enabled us to explore the participants' fatigue management in greater depth. Each data type (i.e., qualitative and quantitative data) complemented the other and led to a richer understanding than either could provide in isolation.

Drawing on a series of focus groups with qualitative researchers, this article critically explores the meanings ascribed to qualitative research practice and the perceived challenges posed by contemporary innovations in data management, access, and analysis through electronic archiving. The accounts presented provide much needed insight into key debates (and divergences) within the qualitative community regarding the values and meanings of qualitative practice, but also how contemporary innovations may come to challenge these core values.

AB This article identifies the epistemological and ethical problems that accompany the growing mandate to archive and share qualitative data. We call attention to the potential consequences of "shared access" for data that is premised on meaning-making and interpretation embedded in interactions between the researcher and those they study. We argue that context specificity and the co-constitutive processes of qualitative data production preclude the separation of "evidence" from the relations of its production that is required when evidence is archived for future use by others. Furthermore, we identify the ethical challenges that attend to ensuring the rights and confidentiality of those we engage and the particular concerns such engagement entails for vulnerable populations when securing informed consent for the use of data by future unknown researchers. Finally, we ask whether the claim for greater efficiencies and accountability of public access are appropriate for the co-constitutive character of qualitative evidence and what these demands portend for knowledge production. We conclude by calling for the development of protocols to guide researchers who are sensitive to these issues but must respond to calls to archive and share their data.

This procedure may be employed not only across projects carried out by the same researchers (reuse), but perhaps more importantly also across scholars working separately prior to data analysis (sharing). The paper then notes possible opportunities, important considerations, barriers, benefits, and recommendations for data reuse and sharing.

ID MALE CIRCUMCISION; HIV PREVENTION; MEN
AB Background: Participatory approaches to qualitative research practice constantly change in response to evolving research environments. Researchers are increasingly encouraged to undertake secondary analysis of qualitative data, despite epistemological and ethical challenges. Interpretive focus groups can be described as a more participative method for groups to analyse qualitative data.
   Objective: To facilitate interpretive focus groups with women in Papua New Guinea to extend analysis of existing qualitative data and co-create new primary data. The purpose of this was to inform a transformational grounded theory and subsequent health promoting action.
   Design: A two-step approach was used in a grounded theory study about how women experience male circumcision in Papua New Guinea. Participants analysed portions or 'chunks' of existing qualitative data in story circles and built upon this analysis by using the visual research method of storyboarding.
   Results: New understandings of the data were evoked when women in interpretive focus groups analysed the data 'chunks'. Interpretive focus groups encouraged women to share their personal experiences about male circumcision. The visual method of storyboarding enabled women to draw pictures to represent their experiences. This provided an additional focus for whole-of-group discussions about the research topic.
   Conclusions: Interpretive focus groups offer opportunity to enhance trustworthiness of findings when researchers undertake secondary analysis of qualitative data. The co-analysis of existing data and co-generation of new data between research participants and researchers informed an emergent transformational grounded theory and subsequent health promoting action.

AB We conducted a qualitative content analysis of health science literature (N = 100) involving qualitative interviews or focus groups. Given recent data sharing mandates, our goal was to characterize the nature of relationships between the researchers and participants to inform ethical deliberations regarding qualitative data sharing and secondary analyses. Specifically, some researchers worry that data sharing might harm relationships, while others claim that data cannot be analyzed absent meaningful relationships with participants. We found little evidence of relationship building with participants. The majority of studies involve single encounters (95%), lasting less than 60 min (59%), with less than half of authors involved in primary data collection. Our findings suggest that relationships with participants might not pose a barrier to sharing some qualitative data collected in the health sciences and speak to the feasibility in principle of secondary analyses of these data.

AB Qualitative data are a rich and often not fully exploited source of research material. Nonetheless they are seldom reanalysed. The analysis of a nationwide German survey of qualitative researchers shows that there are some concerns and open issues associated with this new and unfamiliar research strategy of secondary analysis. On the methodological side specificity and context sensitivity of qualitative research are raised as objections against secondary analysis. On the ethical side concerns relate to an assumed breach of the confidential relationship to the research subject constituted within an interview. Furthermore, considerations concerning competition also play a role when researchers are asked to provide their data for reuse by others. This article provides a first step for a discussion about qualitative secondary analysis (in Germany), by pointing out the critical aspects of secondary analysis based on a dataset of expert interviews. But the experience of the expert researchers who were interviewed suggests that the problems associated with secondary analysis do not necessarily constitute unsolvable obstacles.

ID MIXED METHODS RESEARCH; TRIANGULATION
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide insightful evidence of phenomena in organization and management theory. Textual data sets consist of two different elements, namely qualitative and quantitative aspects. Researchers often combine methods to harness both aspects. However, they frequently do this in a comparative, convergent, or sequential way.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper illustrates and discusses a hybrid textual data analysis approach employing the qualitative software application GABEK-WinRelan in a case study of an Austrian retail bank.
   Findings - The paper argues that a hybrid analysis method, fully intertwining qualitative and quantitative analysis simultaneously on the same textual data set, can deliver new insight into more facets of a data set.
   Originality/value - A hybrid approach is not a universally applicable solution to approaching research and management problems. Rather, this paper aims at triggering and intensifying scientific discussion about stronger integration of qualitative and quantitative data and analysis methods in management research.

AB Background: Uncertainty is common in advanced illness but is infrequently studied in this context. If poorly addressed, uncertainty can lead to adverse patient outcomes.
   Aim: We aimed to understand patient experiences of uncertainty in advanced illness and develop a typology of patients' responses and preferences to inform practice.
   Design: Secondary analysis of qualitative interview transcripts. Studies were assessed for inclusion and interviews were sampled using maximum-variation sampling. Analysis used a thematic approach with 10% of coding cross-checked to enhance reliability.
   Setting/participants: Qualitative interviews from six studies including patients with heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal disease, cancer and liver failure.
   Results: A total of 30 transcripts were analysed. Median age was 75 (range, 43-95), 12 patients were women. The impact of uncertainty was frequently discussed: the main related themes were engagement with illness, information needs, patient priorities and the period of time that patients mainly focused their attention on (temporal focus). A typology of patient responses to uncertainty was developed from these themes.
   Conclusion: Uncertainty influences patient experience in advanced illness through affecting patients' information needs, preferences and future priorities for care. Our typology aids understanding of how patients with advanced illness respond to uncertainty. Assessment of these three factors may be a useful starting point to guide clinical assessment and shared decision making.

AB While secondary data analysis of quantitative data has become commonplace and encouraged across disciplines, the practice of secondary data analysis with qualitative data has met more criticism and concerns regarding potential methodological and ethical problems. Though commentary about qualitative secondary data analysis has increased, little is known about the current state of qualitative secondary data analysis or how researchers are conducting secondary data analysis with qualitative data. This critical interpretive synthesis examined research articles (n = 71) published between 2006 and 2016 that involved qualitative secondary data analysis and assessed the context, purpose, and methodologies that were reported. Implications of findings are discussed, with particular focus on recommended guidelines and best practices of conducting qualitative secondary data analysis.

AB Secondary qualitative data analysis is nearly unknown in Germany. This article aims to introduce this research strategy and the current related debate, and in so doing to contribute to its anchoring into the canon of empirical social research methods. Applying new perspectives to 'old' data offers the potential for generating new insights and theories, answering still open and specific questions as well as evaluating research results. Combining and comparing different data sets promotes a cumulative research process and the generalisability of research results. These advantages of secondary analysis can be facilitated by manifold existing tools. However, there are a number of epistemological, methodological, ethical and confidentiality issues which have to be considered. This paper first presents the opportunities presented by such a research strategy, before going on to formulate an introduction to the debate. We then address the organisational issues connected with the provision of services and establishing a data sharing culture. Finally, we introduce the further contributions of the volume, which refer to the concept of secondary analysis, to its application by means of concrete examples, as well as to the special issues and solutions surrounding this research strategy from the perspective of consulted experts.

AB This article describes three secondary analyses of qualitative interview data about social relationships in online communities, making use of a-priori (theory-driven) as well as post-hoc approaches (such as Grounded Theory) and also looking at the data from a variety of different research contexts and questions. Comparing the different approaches taken shows that both a-priori as well as post-hoc designs might successfully be applied in secondary analyses. Furthermore, loss of context when reusing data does not necessarily lead to a decrease in data quality and explanatory power. Secondary analyses might thus constitute a meaningful part of an overall qualitative research strategy, especially when combined with additional primary data.

AB The importance of outpatient cancer care services is increasing due to the growing number of patients having or having had cancer. However, little is known about cooperation among physicians in outpatient settings. To understand what inter- and multidisciplinary care means in community settings, we conducted an amplified secondary analysis that combined qualitative interview data with 42 general practitioners (GPs), 21 oncologists and 21 urologists that mainly worked in medical practices in Germany. We compared their perspectives on cooperation relationships in cancer care. Our results indicate that all participants regarded cooperation as a prerequisite for good cancer care. Oncologists and urologists mainly reported cooperating for tumour-specific treatment tasks, while GPs' reasoning for cooperation was more patient-centred. While oncologists and urologists reported experiencing reciprocal communication with other physicians, GPs had to gather the information they needed. GPs seldom reported engaging in formal cooperation structures, while for specialists, participation in formal spaces of cooperation, such as tumour boards, facilitated a more frequent and informal discussion of patients, for instance on the phone. Further research should focus on ways to foster GPs' integration in cancer care and evaluate if this can be reached by incorporating GPs in formal cooperation structures such as tumour boards.

DT Article
ID HEALTH RESEARCH; ETHICAL-ISSUES
AB Qualitative health data are rarely shared in the United States (U.S.). This is unfortunate because gathering qualitative data is labor and time-intensive, and data sharing enables secondary research, training, and transparency. A new U.S. federal policy mandates data sharing by 2023, and is agnostic to data type. We surveyed U.S. qualitative researchers (N = 425) on the barriers and facilitators of sharing qualitative health or sensitive research data. Most researchers (96%) have never shared qualitative data in a repository. Primary concerns were lack of participant permission to share data, data sensitivity, and breaching trust. Researcher willingness to share would increase if participants agreed and if sharing increased the societal impact of their research. Key resources to increase willingness to share were funding, guidance, and de-identification assistance. Public health and biomedical researchers were most willing to share. Qualitative researchers need to prepare for this new reality as sharing qualitative data requires unique considerations.

AB The open science movement has framed data sharing as necessary and achievable best practices for high-quality science. Feminist psychologists have complicated that narrative by questioning the purpose of data sharing across different paradigms, methodologies, and research populations. In these debates, the academic community has centered the needs and voices of researchers, and participants' perspectives are largely missing from this literature. In this study, we sought to understand how research participants feel about sharing qualitative data on a sensitive subject-sexual victimization. As part of a participatory action research project, we conducted qualitative interviews with sexual assault survivors about their post-assault help-seeking experiences. The federal funding agency that supported this project requires researchers to archive de-identified data in a national data repository (the National Archive of Criminal Justice Data [NACJD]). All participants consented to archiving data, and the vast majority expressed positive views about data sharing because they wanted to help other survivors. Participants emphasized that our participatory action research approach and our stated goal of helping survivors were important considerations in their decisions regarding data sharing. Researchers should obtain informed consent from their participants for data sharing/archiving, and discuss their dissemination plans during the informed consent process.

AB Objective: The open science movement seeks to make research more transparent, and to that end, researchers are increasingly expected or required to archive their data in national repositories. In qualitative trauma research, data sharing could compromise participants' safety, privacy, and confidentiality because narrative data can be more difficult to de-identify fully. There is little guidance in the traumatology literature regarding how to discuss data-sharing requirements with participants during the informed consent process. Within a larger research project in which we interviewed assault survivors, we developed and evaluated a protocol for informed consent for qualitative data sharing and engaging participants in data de-identification. Method: We conducted qualitative interviews with N = 32 adult sexual assault survivors regarding (a) how to conduct informed consent for data sharing, (b) whether participants should have input on sharing their data, and (c) whether they wanted to redact information from their transcripts prior to archiving. Results: No potential participants declined participation after learning about the archiving mandate. Survivors indicated that they wanted input on archiving because the interview is their story of trauma and abuse and it would be disempowering not to have control over how this information was shared and disseminated. Survivors also wanted input on this process to help guard their privacy, confidentiality, and safety. None of the participants elected to redact substantive data prior to archiving. Conclusions: Engaging participants in the archiving process is a feasible practice that is important and empowering for trauma survivors.
   Clinical Impact Statement Researchers are often expected or required to archive their data in national repositories. Sharing data from trauma research studies could compromise participants' safety, privacy, and confidentiality, so researchers must take extra precautions. In this study, we developed and evaluated a trauma-informed archiving protocol. During the consent process, we explained data sharing to our participants and offered them options for what information would be archived and how it would be archived. The protocol was well received, and all participants agreed to archive their data.

AB AimThe aim of this secondary qualitative descriptive analysis was to examine how nurses construct a definition of older peoples' safety risks and provide care while working within organisational contexts that are focused on diminishing patient risks.
   BackgroundNumbers of older patients are increasing in acute hospital contextscontexts that place their focus on patient safety. Nurses need to manage tensions between older peoples' risks, evidence-informed practice decisions, limited resources and organisational emphases on patient falls. To date, their practice dilemmas have not been well examined.
   DesignA secondary qualitative descriptive analysis was conducted using data that were collected between June 2010 and May 2011 to examine nursing practice with hospitalised older people.
   MethodsAll field notes and transcribed data were reviewed to generate themes representing 18 Registered Nurses' perceptions about safe care for hospitalised older people. The first author generated categories that described how nurses construct definitions of safety risks for older people. All authors engaged in an iterative analytic process that resulted in themes capturing nurses' efforts to provide care in limited resource environments while considering older peoples' safety risks.
   ResultsNurses constructed definitions of patient safety risks in the context of institutional directives. Nurses provided care using available resources as efficiently as possible and accessing co-worker support. They also minimised the importance of older people's functional abilities by setting priorities for medically delegated tasks and immobilising their patients to reduce their risks.
   ConclusionsNurses' definitions of patient risk, which were shaped by impoverished institutional resources and nurses' lack of valuing of functional abilities, contributed to suboptimal care for older adults. Nurses' definitions of risk as physical injury reduced their attention to patients' functional abilities, which nurses reported suffered declines as a result.
   Implications for practiceLeaders need to examine how organisational emphases on particular areas of patient safety and resource constraints contribute to suboptimal care of older people. Nurses understanding of patient risk must incorporate older patients' functional abilities.

AB Mixed methods sampling has played a minor role in methodological discussions so far. In particular, there is a lack of information about practical implementations and critical reflections of sampling decisions and sampling steps showing the benefits and challenges of different approaches. Therefore, this paper demonstrates by drawing on an empirical example, how quantitative secondary data analysis (German Socio-Economic Panel, Linked Employer-Employee Data, Employment History) can support the empirically informed formation of contrast groups for qualitative sampling plans as well as field access to these contrast groups. Furthermore, the article will show how an additional theoretical sampling can extend the empirically grounded composition of contrast groups and can build upon the quantitative secondary data. The discussion is based on a project with an explanatory sequential research design which combines quantitative secondary analysis with subsequent expert interviews with human resources managers in companies and narrative interviews with employees. The project focusses on the causes, practices, and consequences of employment relationships with an interrupted membership in the same employing organization ("recalls").

AB In our qualitative study, men with fragility fractures described their spouses as playing an integral role in their health behaviours. Men also described taking risks, preferring not to dwell on the meaning of the fracture and/or their bone health. Communication strategies specific to men about bone health should be developed.
   We examined men's experiences and behaviours regarding bone health after a fragility fracture.
   We conducted a secondary analysis of five qualitative studies. In each primary study, male and female participants were interviewed for 1-2 h and asked to describe recommendations they had received for bone health and what they were doing about those recommendations. Maintaining the phenomenological approach of the primary studies, the transcripts of all male participants were re-analyzed to highlight experiences and behaviours particular to men.
   Twenty-two men (50-88 years old) were identified. Sixteen lived with a wife, male partner, or family member and the remaining participants lived alone. Participants had sustained hip fractures (n = 7), wrist fractures (n = 5), vertebral fractures (n = 2) and fractures at other locations (n = 8). Fourteen were taking antiresorptive medication at the time of the interview. In general, men with a wife/female partner described these women as playing an integral role in their health behaviours, such as removing tripping hazards and organizing their medication regimen. While participants described giving up activities due to their bone health, they also described taking risks such as drinking too much alcohol and climbing ladders or deliberately refusing to adhere to bone health recommendations. Finally, men did not dwell on the meaning of the fracture and/or their bone health.
   Behaviours consistent with those shown in other studies on men were described by our sample. We recommend that future research address these findings in more detail so that communication strategies specific to men about bone health be developed.

AB Objective: To explore factors contributing to intentional and unintentional medication nonadherence in adults with chronic heart failure (HF).
   Background: Medication nonadherence is prevalent in HF but the factors contributing to it are not well understood.
   Methods: This secondary data analysis of qualitative data explored narrative accounts about medication adherence from four previous studies (N = 112). The Necessity Concerns Framework derived from the Common Sense Model (CSM) of Self-Regulation guided the interpretation of themes.
   Results: In this diverse sample (39% Black, 6% Hispanic, 63% male; mean age 59 15 years), 90% reported at least intermittent nonadherence. For many (60%), missing medication was unintentional but 27% reported intentional nonadherence. Four interconnected patterns of behavior emerged: 1) rarely non adherent, 2) frequently nonadherent, 3) intentionally nonadherent, and 4) reformed nonadherent. Misperceptions about HF, beliefs, concerns, and contextual factors contributed to both intentional and unintentional nonadherence.
   Conclusion: Medication nonadherence is prevalent in HF and influenced by modifiable factors. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Between 2010 and 2016, Asian Americans (AA) had a 35% increase in HIV diagnosis. Although mother-daughter sexual communication was found to be protective in minority populations, the opposite is true among AAs. The purpose of this study was to explore AA women's experiences of sexual communication with their mothers. Secondary qualitative analysis using analytic expansion with a phenomenological approach was used. Thematic analysis was used to search for common patterns and themes that emerged using qualitative description methodology. Twenty East and Southeast AA cisgender women, ages 18-33 years, were interviewed. The primary finding was an intergenerational gap with two themes: (a) mothers' attitudes about sexual communication and (b) content of sexual communication. Indirect sexual communication included cautionary messages consistent with previous studies. AA mothers' strong cultural beliefs created a barrier to communication. Future research should focus on the young women who want open sexual communication and could influence the next generation.

For addressing future health care needs, insurance companies require access to health data to deliver preventative and proactive digital health services to customers. However, extant research is limited in examining the conditions that incentivize health data sharing.
   Objective: This study aimed to (1) identify the expectations of insurance customers when sharing health data, (2) determine the perceived intrinsic value of health data, and (3) explore the conditions that aid in incentivizing health data sharing in the relationship between an insurance organization and its customer.
   Methods: A Web-based survey was distributed to randomly selected customers from a Finnish insurance organization through email. A single open-text answer was used for a qualitative data analysis through inductive coding, followed by a thematic analysis. Furthermore, the 4 constructs of commitment, power, reciprocity, and trust from the social exchange theory (SET) were applied as a framework.
   Results: From the 5000 customers invited to participate, we received 452 surveys (response rate: 9.0%). Customer characteristics were found to reflect customer demographics. Of the 452 surveys, 48 (10.6%) open-text responses were skipped by the customer, 57 (12.6%) customers had no expectations from sharing health data, and 44 (9.7%) customers preferred to abstain from a data sharing relationship. Using the SET framework, we found that customers expected different conditions to be fulfilled by their insurance provider based on the commitment, power, reciprocity, and trust constructs. Of the 452 customers who completed the surveys, 64 (14.2%) customers required that the insurance organization meets their data treatment expectations (commitment). Overall, 4.9% (22/452) of customers were concerned about their health data being used against them to profile their health, to increase insurance prices, or to deny health insurance claims (power). A total of 28.5% (129/452) of customers expected some form of benefit, such as personalized digital health services, and 29.9% (135/452) of customers expected finance-related compensation (reciprocity). Furthermore, 7.5% (34/452) of customers expected some form of empathy from the insurance organization through enhanced transparency or an emotional connection (trust).
   Conclusions: To aid in the design and development of digital health services, insurance organizations need to address the customers' expectations when sharing their health data. We established the expectations of customers in the social exchange of health data and explored the perceived values of data as intangible goods. Actions by the insurance organization should aim to increase trust through a culture of transparency, commitment to treat health data in a prescribed manner, provide reciprocal benefits through digital health services that customers deem valuable, and assuage fears of health data being used to prevent providing insurance coverage or increase costs.

AB Aim To review the published qualitative literature on the lived experience of people with diabetes, describe the emerging findings and research methods over the last 25 years, and make recommendations for future research.
   Methods We describe a 'Next-Generation' mixed-method approach to reporting qualitative data that combines the advantages of traditional qualitative analysis (assessing depth of meaning from participants themselves) with those of descriptive analysis (assessing breadth and representativeness). We used our Next-Generation approach to conduct a secondary analysis of qualitative data derived from a systematic search of PubMed. A formal coding scheme was developed and systematically applied to 2050 respondent quotations contained in the 74 selected articles; inter-rater agreement was high (kappa = 0.90). Quotations were aggregated at the level of the article and reported to assess both narratives and numerical counts of the data.
   Results The rate of qualitative research on the lived experience of diabetes has increased over the last 25 years. Both positive and negative aspects of lived experience were reported, although the former was less common. Data from many different populations were reported, but most studies emphasized breadth of coverage over depth. Some findings are well established and there is little benefit to repeating these studies. Best practices of qualitative methodology were often not utilized.
   Conclusions The amount of qualitative research in diabetes is substantial and increasing. We recommend that future research be focused on specific understudied topics rather than repeating existing research. We also provide recommendations for how qualitative study methodology can be improved by implementing the Next-Generation approach.

AB Opportunities, challenges and recommended targeted actions to accelerate qualitative data sharing to address complex socio-environmental problems
   Socio-environmental synthesis as a research approach contributes to broader sustainability policy and practice by reusing data from disparate disciplines in innovative ways. Synthesizing diverse data sources and types of evidence can help to better conceptualize, investigate and address increasingly complex socio-environmental problems. However, sharing qualitative data for re-use remains uncommon when compared to sharing quantitative data. We argue that qualitative data present untapped opportunities for sustainability science, and discuss practical pathways to facilitate and realize the benefits from sharing and reusing qualitative data. However, these opportunities and benefits are also hindered by practical, ethical and epistemological challenges. To address these challenges and accelerate qualitative data sharing, we outline enabling conditions and suggest actions for researchers, institutions, funders, data repository managers and publishers.

AB Background Activity trackers are becoming increasingly popular, but patients often hesitate to share the data from such devices with their health care providers. Researchers have shown that sharing everyday health data with physicians can foster greater patient engagement. Objectives This research is intended to investigate activity tracker users' decisions regarding the sharing of their activity tracker data with physicians, as well as to build a stage based framework for improving patient engagement by fostering such data sharing. Methods Qualitative analysis of interview records of 12 adults, who had used Fitbit activity tracking devices for up to two years, identifying emotions and experiences surrounding their tendencies to share physical exercise data with a physician. Results This research used the subjects' emotions and considerations regarding the decision over whether to share exercise data with physicians to create a stage based framework with three stages: cognisance, tangible evidence and supportive feedback. Conclusion The tendency to progress towards three stages with greater patient-physician engagement appears to increase with health risk profile and with reduced data privacy concerns. This framework contributes to ongoing discussions about establishing patient-practitioner engagement, based around patients' shared personal data collection.

AB BackgroundInjecting drug users are at high risk of HIV infection globally. Research related to female drug users is rare in Kenya, yet it is required to inform the development of gender-sensitive HIV prevention and harm reduction services in East Africa, where injecting drug use is on the rise.MethodsThis studyaimed to document the nature of HIV risks encountered by women who inject drugs in the Mombasa and Kilifi, Kenya. Secondary data analysis was conducted on an existing dataset from a 2015 primary qualitative study involving 24 interviews and 3 focus group discussions with 45 women who inject drugs. These were complemented with five interviews with key stakeholders involved in the provision of services to women who inject drugs. Guided by the social ecology theory, a thematic analysis was conducted to identify the nature of HIV risks and their underlying determinants.ResultsHIV risk behaviours fell into two broad categories: unsafe injecting and unprotected sex. These risks occurred in the form of sharing of needles, unprotected oral, anal, and vaginal sex, sexual assaults, injecting drug use during sex, sex work, and other types of transactional sex. The primary determinants underlying these risks were a low-risk perception, inequitable gender power, economic pressures, and poor availability of needles and condoms. These social-ecological determinants did not exist in isolation, but intersected with each other to create powerful influences which exposed women to HIV. Social-ecological determinants exerted constant influence and created a persistent HIV risk environment' that was involuntarily experienced by women.ConclusionIndividual, interpersonal, and societal-structural factors intersect to produce HIV risk behaviours. As a minimum, these risks will require a combination of multifaceted micro-level interventions including self-efficacy training, risk assessment skills, couple counselling, and universal access to the recommended harm reduction package. In addition, the current focus on micro-level interventions in Kenya needs to shift to incorporate macro-level interventions, including livelihood, employability, and gender norms-transforming interventions, to mitigate economic and gender-related drivers of HIV risks. In the Kenyan context, injecting drug use during sex work is emerging as an increasingly important HIV risk behaviour needing to be addressed.

AB Background: Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by inattention, hyperactivity and/or impulsivity. Young people with ADHD have poorer educational and social outcomes than their peers. We aimed to better understand educational experiences of young people with ADHD in the UK, and make actionable recommendations for schools.Methods: In this secondary analysis of qualitative data, we used Thematic Analysis to analyse information relating to experiences of education from 64 young people with ADHD and 28 parents who participated in the Children and adolescents with ADHD in Transition between Children's services and adult Services (CATCh-uS) study. Emerging patterns within and across codes led to organization of the data into themes and subthemes through an iterative process.Results: Two main themes were generated. The first described young people's early experiences of education, often within a mainstream setting; we labelled this the problematic provision loop, as this was a negative cycle that was repeated several times for some participants. The second theme described young people's more positive progression through education once they progressed out of the problematic loop.Conclusions: Educational experiences for young people with ADHD are often negative and fraught with complication. Young people with ADHD often found themselves on a more positive trajectory after they were placed in an alternative form of education provision (mainstream or otherwise), or where they were able to study topics that interest them and play to their strengths. We make recommendations that commissioners, local authorities and schools could consider in order to better support those with ADHD.

AB Objective Cancer patients in Zimbabwe typically access health services with advanced disease, limiting treatment choices and lessening the likelihood of positive treatment outcomes. We outline experiences of patients with advanced cancer prior to interaction with palliative care services to identify targets for future intervention development to enhance care delivery in Zimbabwe. Methods Participants were purposively sampled adult patients with advanced cancer. We adopted a thematic approach to guide a qualitative secondary data analysis exploring factors influencing support sought by participants, external factors influencing decision making across the disease trajectory and the process for seeking and accessing palliative care. Results Participants reported fragmented and uncoordinated care, from initial symptom experience and throughout disease progression. A recurring notion of disjuncture was present through participants' experiences of gaps, breaks and discontinuity across the disease trajectory. Each step had a beginning and end without clear routes for transition with movement between steps as a result of happenstance or informal encounters. Conclusion Targets for intervention development at the patient and family level exist that may reduce the disjuncture currently experienced between need and care provision. A holistic response that incorporates engagement with policy actors is critical to addressing prominent financial constraints for patients.

SO HEALTH EDUCATION RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB In a large-scale survey the qualitative component of the interview is often used either to refine the quantitative coding categories or to get a 'general feel' for the respondents' comments with no attempt at analysis. This article reports on an approach which has been developed for solving some of the problems of linkage of qualitative and quantitative components at the survey analysis stage. This approach is dependent on efficient methods of data management and text retrieval, and presupposes a system of data collection that produces computer-based text files to store the verbatim comments of study participants. The size of the data set necessitated using a mainframe computer for data management, text retrieval and analysis. The article provides illustrations of how the analysis of 11 000 files consisting of textual data was facilitated.

AB Aims and objectives To describe individuals' with type 2 diabetes mellitus sense-making of blood glucose data and other influences impacting self-management behaviour.
   Background Type 2 diabetes mellitus prevalence is increasing globally. Adherence to effective diabetes self-management regimens is an ongoing healthcare challenge. Examining individuals' sense-making processes can advance staff knowledge of and improve diabetes self-management behaviour.
   Design A qualitative exploratory design examining how individuals make sense of blood glucose data and symptoms, and the influence on self-management decisions.
   Methods Sixteen one-on-one interviews with adults diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus using a semi-structured interview guide were conducted from March-May 2018. An inductive-deductive thematic analysis of data using the Sensemaking Framework for Chronic Disease Self-Management was used. The consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research (COREQ) checklist were used in completing this paper.
   Results Three main themes described participants' type 2 diabetes mellitus sense-making and influences on self-management decisions: classifying blood glucose data, building mental models and making self-management decisions. Participants classified glucose levels based on prior personal experiences. Participants learned about diabetes from classes, personal experience, health information technology and their social network. Seven participants expressed a need for periodic refreshing of diabetes knowledge.
   Conclusion Individuals use self-monitored glucose values and/or HbA1C values to evaluate glucose control. When using glucose values, they analyse the context in which the value was obtained through the lens of personal parameters and expectations. Understanding how individuals make sense of glycaemic data and influences on diabetes self-management behaviour with periodic reassessment of this understanding can guide the healthcare team in optimising collaborative individualised care plans.
   Relevance to clinical practice Nurses must assess sense-making processes in self-management decisions. Periodic "refresher" diabetes education may be needed for individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

AB Background How to meaningfully partner with patients as data analysts remains obscure. A process evaluation of the 'Improving the Safety and Continuity Of Medicines management at care Transitions' (ISCOMAT) cluster randomised control trial of an intervention for improving medicines use for people living with heart failure is being conducted. The intervention includes patient held information on heart medicines and care, enhanced communication between hospital and community pharmacists, and increased engagement of community pharmacists with patient care post-hospital discharge. ISCOMAT patients living with heart failure were interviewed about experiences with the intervention. We sought to gain insights from patients on data collected to enhance our understanding of experiences with the intervention.
   Objective To develop a method for involving patients as analysts of qualitative data in a process evaluation.
   Design Patients and researchers co-analysed qualitative data. A framework method was applied involving; familiarisation, coding, developing an analytical framework and interpretation. The process was facilitated through home working and a workshop with a training component.
   Results The co-designed framework enabled researchers to map all further patient interview data. Patients' specialist knowledge enhanced understanding of how the ISCOMAT intervention can be best implemented.
   Conclusions Patients' unique experiences can enhance validity and rigour in data analysis through sharing their interpretations of qualitative data. The involvement process is crucial in elucidating knowledge and avoiding tokenism. As analysts, patients gain an appreciation of research processes, building trust between researchers and patients. Group dynamics and involving patients throughout the whole research process are important considerations.

TI ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION WHEN CHOOSING A QUALITATIVE DATA
   MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING
LA English
DT Article
AB A primary issue in conducting qualitative research is the time required for data analysis. Qualitative research can be costly, since data analysis is generally labour intensive and our time factors into money. There is, unfortunately, no magic formula for hastening the conceptual tasks associated with qualitative analysis, yet effective qualitative data management systems (QDMS) expedite the mechanical tasks, those tasks associated with storing and retrieving qualitative data. Rapid and smooth data management increases the time one can allot to data analysis. Although computer QDMS are increasingly recommended for their time-saving potential in relation to data management, some significant issues associated with the adoption of a computer versus a manual QDMS have not yet been fully explored. The purpose of this paper is to present major issues researchers should consider in choosing a computer or a manual QDMS. These issues include availability and accessibility, comfort, appropriateness, efficiency, thoroughness and contextualization.

AB The article illustrates some of the strategies we are developing in the secondary analysis of Timescapes data and seeks to draw some general lessons for qualitative data analysts. We focus on three different areas of work. Across all of these we examine the potential explanatory value of working with data in a comparative way, and engage with some challenges presented by contextual specificity in the way qualitative data are generated. In the first area we consider the issue of how we situate qualitative data with reference to diversity across the population, and use an example of working between a single qualitative Timescapes data set and survey data. Understanding how qualitative data are situated offers a framework for internal comparison which maps onto wider diversity. In the second area we consider the outcome of bringing together primary researchers whose comparison of project data, as secondary analysts, allow them to 'hear silences' and, therefore, re-interrogate their own data within a revised conceptual framework. In the third area we describe how, as secondary analysts, we have worked across Timescapes data sets. Here we consider the challenges of undertaking secondary analysis across diverse, project specific, research contexts, and the potential of comparative working across data sets for enhancing understanding.

AB Evidence is emerging of the potential of person-centred approaches to create partnerships between professionals and patients while also containing healthcare costs. This is important for enhancing outcomes in individuals with complex needs, who consistently report poor experiences with care. The shift towards person-centred care (PCC) is, however, a radical departure from the norm, with increased expectations of both professional and patient. Although there have been studies on the ways in which health care professionals can modify practice to enhance PCC, not all patients welcome changes to their care delivery or understand the aim of the new approach. Without engagement and understanding from the patient, a PCC approach will fail to initiate. Few studies explore how, why and in what circumstances patients become more involved in their care and what professionals can do to enhance participation. We conducted a secondary analysis of qualitative data to examine this issue. Data were collected between 2014 and 2018 from primary care-based PCC projects across the southwest of England. Supported by people with experience (practitioners and those receiving treatment), theory building workshops developed an explanatory framework that identified contextual factors and mechanisms likely to contribute to effective engagement. Our results show that engagement in a care partnership is achieved through trust and a patient's sense of candidacy. Shared understanding of purpose, clarity of expectations and power sharing were found to facilitate trusted relationships between professional and patient and encourage candidacy. Only then is it possible to develop goals that are meaningful to the patient. Our theory of engagement applies to professionals and patients alike but places the initial burden of responsibility on those who hold the most power: the professional and the system. This theory has the potential to explain patient engagement in PCC and a range of other service interventions, treatments and intervention research.

AB Like a video that reveals much more than a single photo, the incorporation of time to the analysis of qualitative evidence promotes contextualized understandings and allows research participants and readers to interactively review the processes and rationale that researchers followed to craft their findings and conclusions. However, mixed methods and qualitative methodologies available today forfeit the nuances gained by analyzing the chronological/temporal evolution of processes. We contribute to mixed methods research by introducing graphical retrieval and analysis of temporal information systems (GRATIS), a methodology (and open-access software) designed to visualize and analyze the time-based richness embedded in all qualitative/textual data. GRATIS employs dynamic network visualizations and data science mining/retrieval tools to combat the assumption that longitudinal studies require large timespans. We showcase how all qualitatively- or machine-learning-coded textual data may be analyzed with no extra feature engineering (i.e., data cleaning or preparation), rendering fully integrative/interactive outputs that strengthen the transparency of our findings and conclusions and open the "analytic black box" that characterizes most of mixed methods and qualitative studies to date. GRATIS contributes to democratizing data science by removing financial and computer programming barriers to benefit from data science applications. All data and software to replicate the analyses are provided with this submission.

AB Discourses of self-harm, and also suicide, are often underpinned by a central tenet: prevention is the priority. This belief is seemingly so inscribed in research that it is rarely interrogated. The present paper re-analyses qualitative data from a hospital-based study of self-harm management and prevention practice. It aims to reflect upon, and disrupt, the authors' latent assumptions about the construct of 'prevention', while reflecting on the research method used. Twenty-five individuals participated in semi-structured interviews: healthcare and affiliated professionals (n = 14); parents and carers (n = 8); and children and young people (aged 9-16 years) who had presented to an emergency department for self-harm, with or without suicidal intent (n = 3). We offer two central discursive considerations: (1) Self-harm prevention is largely an unintelligible concept, having to be reflexively constructed in situ. As such, it is questionable whether it makes sense to discuss the prevention of this amorphous and dynamic phenomenon, which cannot always be disentangled from everyday life; (2) Interviews entail significant biographical work for participants, notably the performance of personal and professional competence for the audience. These interactional dynamics offer a glimpse into the priorities, meanings and needs for participants in relation to self-harm. Together these considerations provide useful insights into how the interview method can serve as both a limiting and illuminating site of knowledge creation.

TI AN APPROACH TO THE MANAGEMENT AND CODING OF QUALITATIVE DATA USING
   MICROCOMPUTERS
SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF SOCIAL WORK
LA English
DT Article
AB Social scientists are increasingly asked to contribute to action-research projects using their skills as qualitative researchers. The large volume of textual data produced by even a fairly small qualitative study poses special problems in terms of data management. Recent advances in the use of microcomputers for qualitative data management and analysis provide at least a partial solution. The paper describes an effective method for managing qualitative data on microcomputers using textual data management software and incorporating appropriate coding procedures.

AB Background Clinical guidance promotes the practitioner-patient relationship as integral to good quality person-centred care for patients with depression. However, patients can struggle to engage with practitioners and practitioners have indicated that they want more guidance on how to establish effective relationships with their patients.
   Objective To identify what practitioner attributes patients with depression particularly value or find problematic.
   Method A secondary analysis of data collected during four qualitative studies, all of which entailed interviewing patients diagnosed with depression about their treatment experiences. Patients in the four studies had received different treatments. These included antidepressants, cognitive behaviour therapy, facilitated physical activity and listening visits. We thematically analysed 32 patient accounts.
   Results We identified two complimentary sets of important practitioner attributes: the first based on the practitioner's bearing; the second based on the practitioner's enabling role. We found that patients value practitioners who consider their individual manner, share relevant personal information, show interest and acceptance, communicate clearly and listen carefully, collaborate on manageable goals and sanction greater patient self-care and self-compassion. It was also evident that patients receiving different treatments value the same practitioner attributes and that when these key practitioner qualities were not evident, patients were liable not to re-attend or comply with treatment.
   Conclusion The practitioner attributes that patients with depression most value have a positive impact on their engagement with treatment. Patients emphasise the importance of a practitioner's demeanour and encouragement, rather than the amount of time or specific treatment a practitioner is able to provide.

AB Purpose: This qualitative analysis of interviews with surgical patients who received a brief perioperative psy-chological intervention, in conjunction with standard medical perioperative care, elucidates patient perspec-tives on the use of pain self-management skills in relation to postoperative analgesics.Design: This study is a secondary analysis of qualitative data from a randomized controlled trial.Methods: Participants (N = 21) were rural-dwelling United States Military Veterans from a mixed surgical sample who were randomized to receive a manual-based, telephone-based Perioperative Pain Self -manage-ment intervention consisting of a total of four pre-and postoperative contacts. Semi-structured qualitative interviews elicited participant feedback on the cognitive-behavioral intervention. Data was analyzed by two qualitative experts using MAXQDA software. Key word analyses focused on mention of analgesics in interviews.Findings: Interviews revealed a dominant theme of ambivalence towards postoperative use of opioids. An additional theme concerned the varied ways acquiring pain self-management skills impacted postoperative opioid (and non-opioid analgesic) consumption. Participants reported that employment of pain self -manage-ment strategies reduced reliance on pharmacology for pain relief, prolonged the time between doses, took the "edge off" pain, and increased pain management self-efficacy.Conclusions: Perioperative patient education may benefit from inclusion of teaching non-pharmacologic pain self-management skills and collaborative planning with patients regarding how to use these skills in con-junction with opioid and non-opioid analgesics. Perianesthesia nurses may be in a critical position to provide interdisciplinary postoperative patient education that may optimize postoperative pain management while minimizing risks associated with prolonged opioid use.Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of American Society of PeriAnesthesia Nurses.

Despite their potential to contribute much to management research, very little concerning the use of such programs has appeared in the management literature. The purpose of this paper is to review the current state Of computer-facilitated qualitative data analysis [CQDA] in order to contribute to its effective use by management researchers. In an effort to achieve this purpose we discuss why CQDA programs are proliferating, describe the potential of such programs to contribute to management research, address program capabilities and features, describe CQDA applications in management research, and review issues researchers should be aware of in considering the use of CQDA.

AB Background Little is known about peoples' self-management experiences and their desires or expectations to engage in self-management. As such, there is little understanding about individuals' perceived cues and barriers to engagement in self-management, particularly in people affected by cancer.
   Objective To understand cues and barriers to people's engagement in self-management during chemotherapy treatment for colorectal cancer.
   Design Secondary analysis of qualitative data from mixed methods, longitudinal study.
   Setting and participants Eleven participants undergoing treatment for colorectal cancer. Semi-structured interviews were conducted twice with each participant, at the start and end of a 6-month course of chemotherapy treatment in a Scottish cancer centre.
   Results Cues and barriers to engagement in self-management appeared to stem from perceptions of the impact and associated severity of side effects experiences as well as the perceptions about the efficacy of chosen self-management activities and perceptions of control in minimizing the consequences of cancer treatment. Severe, episodic or unexpected side effects coupled with perceptions of uncertainty, lack of control and lack of adequate preparation to engage in self-management were identified as key barriers to engagement.
   Discussion and conclusion Participants' reflection on, or appraisal of, their treatment-related experiences and personal abilities, confidence and preferences to manage the impact of these shaped their subsequent engagement in self-management. The findings highlight the importance of understanding individual's self-management experiences, perceptions, preferences, priorities and needs to help support, prepare and enable them to feel capable and confident to engage actively and effectively in self-management.

AB In this paper we argue that theory, method, methodology, and knowledge gains in qualitative field studies are intertwined through the ongoing hypothesis development in the field. We develop our argument through a discussion of specific qualitative field studies in management accounting. We emphasise in particular the distinctive role of theory in qualitative research as relating to expression of a subjective reality more than clarification of an objective one. In considering this subjectivity we discuss the ways in which the doing of qualitative research brings to bear discipline on the researcher allowing us to assess the trustworthiness of their accounts. The intention is to develop a more appropriate basis for judging the plausibility of qualitative field studies than notions borrowed from positivistic methodology. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objectives This study aimed to explore adolescents and young adults' experiences of symptoms related to their eczema in order to determine their psychosocial needs. Design A secondary qualitative analysis of two data sources collected through semi-structured interviews for two different projects, SKINS project and Eczema Care Online project. Methods In total, there were 28 transcripts with adolescents and young adults with eczema having a mean age of 19.5 years available to analyse. Interview data were collected from face-to-face interviews that were recorded and transcribed. Inductive thematic analysis explored data about symptoms and organized according to psychosocial needs. Results Adolescents and young adults with eczema experience both visible symptoms (such as flaky, dry, and inflamed skin) and invisible symptoms (such as itch, pain, exhaustion, and mental distress) that elicit different psychosocial needs. These psychosocial needs are to (i) be understood; (ii) be perceived as normal; and (iii) receive emotional support. Interviewees described a struggle between wanting their peers and family to understand but take their eczema seriously whilst not wanting to stand out and instead to be perceived as 'normal', which they would define as being perceived as other adolescents. This has implications on behaviours, such as seeking support, avoiding going out, hiding their skin, as well as emotional implications, such as social isolation and feeling anxious and low. Conclusions Having a better understanding of young people's experiences and psychosocial needs will provide a framework on how best to support adolescents and young adults when managing symptoms related to eczema. Statement of contribution Whatisalready known on this subject? Eczema has a high impact on children and is considered a burden by children and adults with eczema. However, it is unclear what impact eczema has on adolescents and young adults. Adolescents and young adults with chronic conditions are known to be vulnerable to negative psychosocial outcomes but psychosocial needs and how to best support this age group with eczema are unknown Whatdoesthis add? Three psychosocial needs were developed from evaluating the impact of visible and invisible symptoms of eczema: The need to feel understood (mostly reflective of invisible symptoms such as itch and pain and visible symptoms such as scratching). The need to be perceived as 'normal': visible symptoms such as flaky, inflamed skin make them stand out in comparison with their peers and a need emerged to blend in. The need for emotional support: adolescents and young adults searched for this from their health care providers, from shared experiences and from online resources. Adolescents and young adults with eczema appear to feel ambivalent about wishing the impact of the condition to be acknowledged whilst wishing the condition to be invisible to others. This ambivalence had further impact on feeling self-conscious, seeking support, and dealing with unsolicited advice.

DE Participatory data analysis; public-patient involvement; co-production;
   user involvement; participatory theme elicitation; card sorting
AB Participatory Theme Elicitation (PTE) is a new approach to increasing user-involvement in qualitative data analysis. In this five-step method, participants independently identify themes in the data using open card sorting, and are supported in their development of a set of themes that reflect all participant views. We describe and evaluate PTE with a case study, where nine lay researchers identified five core themes in qualitative data from an online intervention with depressed adults. Total participation time was approximately 6 hours. Evaluation data revealed high levels of satisfaction with the PTE process and the themes generated. The strong commitment to public engagement in social science research and limited guidance on methods for effective participatory analysis of qualitative data highlight the value and growing need for robust standardised approaches such as PTE.

AB This article discusses the use of the Grounded Theory approach to the analysis of qualitative data to develop dynamic theories. The main objective of the article is to explore the major issues in bringing Grounded Theory and System Dynamics approaches together. The discussion employs an example of secondary analysis of qualitative data as a mixed-method research design for System Dynamics researchers. Findings from this example are organized in a table by research stages. Some of the reported major issues have divided researchers in their fields, such as the theoretical sensitivity issue in the Grounded Theory field and the qualitative and quantitative modeling issue in the System Dynamics field. Other major issues, such as the nature and richness of the dataset, can limit the data analysis and the research outputs. Researchers using the mixed-method should address these issues, and the present article offers solutions for them.

AB Estimates suggest that 15% of children in the United Kingdom have been exposed to at least one form of domestic violence (DV) during their childhood, with more than 3% having witnessed an incident during the past year. This exposure increases the risk of children suffering both short-term and long-term impacts, including effects on their behaviour, social development, physical and mental health, educational attainment and quality of life. In addition, children living in environments where there is DV are at higher risk of maltreatment. Adult relatives and friends of the family often observe the experiences of children in situations of DV, and have the potential to shed light in a way that children and survivors may struggle to articulate, or be reluctant to acknowledge or disclose. Such accounts are largely absent from existing research, and yet bring a perspective which can broaden our understanding of the impact that DV has on children. This paper reports a secondary analysis of qualitative data collected during 21 in-depth interviews with people across the United Kingdom who were a friend or family member of a woman experiencing DV. An inductive thematic analysis was undertaken and the themes generated were as follows: 'the context of DV: a chaotic and unpredictable home life'; 'the roles children assume within households where there is DV including: witness of, victim of and conduit of violence and abuse',; 'the impacts of DV on children'; and 'children's coping and resilience'. The implications of these findings are discussed using a basic needs model lens.

AB This article investigates data reuse or the secondary analysis of qualitative data, specifically video records of practice in education, which are used to study the complex cognitive, social, and logistical issues involved in teaching and learning processes. It examines reuse through the lens of the invisibilities experienced by educational researchers who perform secondary analysis on video records of practice. Drawing on 22 in-depth interviews with educational researchers, we examine how they conceptualize secondary analysis of qualitative video data and cope with invisibilities in the data. For example, knowing the original research question was not sufficient: reusers needed to understand more about the intentionality of the data producer. They also sought more information on the reflexivity of the original researcher and how this influenced data production. Additionally, reusers discussed the creation of evidence from the video during secondary analysis as teaching and learning themselves entail invisible processes.

AB Writing and communication researchers are in the early stages of developing procedures for reusing and maximizing the analytical potentials of qualitative data. Contributing to this effort, we critically reflect on our methodological decision-making process in developing innovative procedures for cross-analyzing two distinct studies. Our reflection responds to the need for published guidance on how to undertake methodological adaptation, the lack of which limits opportunities for other researchers to develop new study procedures to address complex problems. By discussing how and why we made particular methodological choices and adaptations in our collaborative study of faculty and doctoral student writers, we propose collaborative secondary data analysis as a fruitful avenue for qualitative writing researchers and show its potential to enact richer and more equitable research designs.

TI Behavioural interventions for weight management in pregnancy: A

DT Review

   OVERWEIGHT WOMEN; AVERAGE-WEIGHT; GAIN; DIETARY; MOTHERS; TRIAL
AB Background: There is a rising prevalence of excessive weight gain in pregnancy and an increasing number of pregnant women who are overweight or obese at the start of the pregnancy. Excessive weight gain during pregnancy is associated with adverse maternal and neonatal consequences and increases the risk of long-term obesity. Pregnancy therefore may be a key time to prevent excessive weight gain and improve the health of women and their unborn child. This systematic review sought to assess the effectiveness of behavioural interventions to prevent excessive weight gain in pregnancy and explore the factors that influence intervention effectiveness.
   Methods: We undertook a systematic review of quantitative and qualitative evidence. This included a meta-analysis of controlled trials of diet and physical activity interventions to prevent excessive weight gain during pregnancy and a thematic synthesis of qualitative studies that investigated the views of women on weight management during pregnancy. A thorough search of eleven electronic bibliographic databases, reference lists of included studies, relevant review articles and experts in the field were contacted to identify potentially relevant studies. Two independent reviewers extracted data. RevMan software was used to perform the meta-analyses. Qualitative data was subject to thematic analysis. Both quantitative and qualitative data were aligned using a matrix framework.
   Results: Five controlled trials and eight qualitative studies were included. The overall pooled effect size found no significant difference in gestational weight gain amongst participants in the intervention group compared with the control group (mean difference -0.28 95% CI -0.64 to 0.09). The study designs, participants and interventions all varied markedly and there was significant heterogeneity within this comparison in the meta-analysis (I-2 67%). Subgroup and sensitivity analysis did not identify contextual elements that influenced the effectiveness of the intervention.
   In a thematic analysis of the qualitative studies, three major themes emerged relating to women's views of weight management in pregnancy: pregnancy as a time of transition and change, conflicting and contradictory messages and a perceived lack of control. When the results of both quantitative and qualitative data were aligned it was clear that some of the barriers that women described in achieving healthy weight gain in pregnancy were not addressed by the interventions evaluated. This may have contributed to the limited effectiveness of the interventions.
   Conclusions: Despite intense and often tailored interventions there was no statistically significant effect on weight gain during pregnancy. Inadequate and often contradictory information regarding healthy weight management was reported by women in qualitative studies and this was addressed in the interventions but this in itself was insufficient to lead to reduced weight gain. Multiple types of interventions, including community based strategies are needed to address this complex health problem.

AB A primary service provided by home care is medication management. Issues with medication management at home place older adults at high risk for hospital admission, readmission, and adverse events. This study sought to understand medication management challenges from the home care provider perspective. A qualitative secondary data analysis approach was used to analyze program evaluation interview data from an interprofessional educational intervention study designed to decrease medication complexity in older urban adults receiving home care. Directed and summative content analysis approaches were used to analyze data from 90 clinician and student participants. Medication safety issues along with provider-provider communication problems were central themes with medication complexity. Fragmented care coordination contributed to medication management complexity. Patient-, provider-, and system-level factors influencing medication complexity and management were identified as contributing to both communication and coordination challenges.

AB Purpose
   To gain an in-depth understanding and provide direction to governments on their quality measurement practices related to open government data (OGD), this paper aims to develop a common frame of reference for quality assessment of OGD.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Qualitative meta-synthesis was used to synthesize previous studies on the quality measurement of OGD. This paper applies a meta-synthesis approach to integrate 10 qualitative studies into a common frame of reference for quality assessment of OGD.
   Findings
   Based on a seven-step meta-synthesis, the paper proposes a common frame of reference for quality assessment of OGD, which includes six indicators, namely, accuracy, accessibility, completeness, timeliness, consistency and understandability.
   Originality/value
   A common frame of reference for quality assessment of OGD will help researchers better understand the quality assessment of OGD and government agencies to improve the quality of OGD that they publish.

TI Linking stress and injury in the farming environment: A secondary
   analysis of qualitative data
SO HEALTH EDUCATION QUARTERLY
LA English
DT Article
AB The first step in injury prevention is to understand the injury problem. This includes examining the nature of the problem from the perspective of the target community. This article uses qualitative methods to explain the nature of the injury problem and identifies prevention strategies through a three-step process: identify a causal model, validate the model, and identify strategies using the causal model. A causal model linking safety performance and safety demand, health decision making, and occupational stress was derived by secondary analysis of farm family focus group data (step 1) and validated by other farm family focus groups (step 2). Prevention strategies identified from the causal model (step 3) include decreasing the number of roles performed exclusively by one individual, developing an easy-to-use planning tool that assists farmers in anticipating and reducing future work demands, and developing an education module that incorporates injury costs into safety decision making.

AB Background: It is essential that clinical documentation and clinical coding be of high quality for the production of healthcare data. Objective: This study assessed qualitatively the strengths and barriers regarding clinical coding quality from the perspective of health information managers. Method: Ten health information managers and clinical coding quality coordinators who oversee clinical coders (CCs) were identified and recruited from nine provinces across Canada. Semi-structured interviews were conducted, which included questions on data quality, costs of clinical coding, education for health information management, suggestions for quality improvement and barriers to quality improvement. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and analysed using directed content analysis and informed by institutional ethnography. Results: Common barriers to clinical coding quality included incomplete and unorganised chart documentation, and lack of communication with physicians for clarification. Further, clinical coding quality suffered as a result of limited resources (e.g. staffing and budget) being available to health information management departments. Managers unanimously reported that clinical coding quality improvements can be made by (i) offering interactive training programmes to CCs and (ii) streamlining sources of information from charts. Conclusion: Although clinical coding quality is generally regarded as high across Canada, clinical coding managers perceived quality to be limited by incomplete and inconsistent chart documentation, and increasing expectations for data collection without equal resources allocated to clinical coding professionals.

ID DIALOGUE; RELIABILITY; INQUIRY
AB All research, e.g., qualitative or quantitative, is concerned with the extent to which analyses can adequately describe the phenomena it seeks to describe. In qualitative research, we use internal validity checks like intercoder agreement to measure the extent to which independent researchers observe the same phenomena in data. Researchers report indices of agreement to serve as evidence of consistency and dependability of interpretations, and we do so to make claims about the trustworthiness of our research accounts. However, few studies report the methods of how multiple analysts developed alignment in their interpretation of data, a process that undergirds accounts of consistency, dependability, and trustworthiness. In this article, we review the issues and options around achieving intercoder agreement. Drawing on our experience from a longitudinal, team-based research project that required rapid cycles of qualitative data analysis, we reflect on the challenges we had achieving high intercoder agreement (which refer to as the perils). It was through these challenges that we developed a method that helps to foster shared ways of seeing data, and thus alignment in our interpretations of phenomena in data. In this article, we present this method as a tool for dyadic and team-based qualitative data analysis to facilitate reliable and consistent high-inference interpretations of data with multiple analysts.

AB Background Demand for high-quality surveillance data for malaria, and other diseases, is greater than ever before. In Uganda, the primary source of malaria surveillance data is the Health Management Information System (HMIS). However, HMIS data may be incomplete, inaccurate or delayed. Collaborative improvement (CI) is a quality improvement intervention developed in high-income countries, which has been advocated for low-resource settings. In Kayunga, Uganda, a pilot study of CI was conducted in five public health centres, documenting a positive effect on the quality of HMIS and malaria surveillance data. A qualitative evaluation was conducted concurrently to investigate the mechanisms of effect and unintended consequences of the intervention, aiming to inform future implementation of CI. Methods The study intervention targeted health workers, including brief in-service training, plus CI with 'plan-do-study-act' (PDSA) cycles emphasizing self-reflection and group action, periodic learning sessions, and coaching from a CI mentor. Health workers collected data on standard HMIS out-patient registers. The qualitative evaluation (July 2015 to September 2016) included ethnographic observations at each health centre (over 12-14 weeks), in-depth interviews with health workers and stakeholders (n = 20), and focus group discussions with health workers (n = 6). Results The results suggest that the intervention did facilitate improvement in data quality, but through unexpected mechanisms. The CI intervention was implemented as planned, but the PDSA cycles were driven largely by the CI mentor, not the health workers. In this context, characterized by a rigid hierarchy within the health system of limited culture of self-reflection and inadequate training and supervision, CI became an effective form of high-quality training with frequent supervisory visits. Health workers appeared motivated to improve data collection habits by their loyalty to the CI mentor and the potential for economic benefits, rather than a desire for self-improvement. Conclusions CI is a promising method of quality improvement and could have a positive impact on malaria surveillance data. However, successful scale-up of CI in similar settings may require deployment of highly skilled mentors. Further research, focusing on the effectiveness of 'real world' mentors using robust study designs, will be required to determine whether CI can be translated effectively and sustainably to low-resource settings.

AB Objective A lack of agreement between clinician and patient priorities can impact the clinician-patient relationship, treatment concordance, and potential health outcomes. Studies have suggested that patients with osteoarthritis (OA) may prioritize comorbidities over their OA, but as yet no explicit systematic exploration of OA patients' priorities in relation to comorbidities exists. This study aims to explore how patients prioritize their OA among their conditions, which factors underlie this prioritization, and whether and why these priorities change over time. Methods A secondary analysis of qualitative data was conducted utilizing 4 existing data sets collated from the 3 research centers involved. Purposive sampling provided a sample of 30 participants who all had OA and comorbidities. The research team collectively coded and analyzed the data thematically. Results Three groups of patients emerged from the analysis. The 2 smaller groups had stable priorities (where OA was or was not prioritized) and illustrated the importance of factors, such as personal social context and the specific nature of the comorbid conditions. The third and largest group reported priorities that shifted over time. Shifting appeared to be influenced by the participants' perceptions of control and/or interactions with clinical professionals, and could have important consequences for self-management behavior. Conclusion The various factors underlying patients' priorities among their conditions, and the fluctuating nature of these priorities, highlight the importance of regular assessments during clinician-patient consultations to allow better communication and treatment planning, and ultimately optimize patient outcomes.

AB Background A growing number of studies show the potential of loyalty card data for use in health research. However, research into public perceptions of using this data is limited. This study aimed to investigate public attitudes towards donating loyalty card data for academic health research, and the safeguards the public would want to see implemented. The way in which participant attitudes varied according to whether loyalty card data would be used for either cancer or COVID-19 research was also examined. Methods Participants (N = 40) were recruited via Prolific Academic to take part in semi-structured telephone interviews, with questions focused on data sharing related to either COVID-19 or ovarian/bowel cancer as the proposed health condition to be researched. Content analysis was used to identify sub-themes corresponding to the two a priori themes, attitudes and safeguards. Results Participant attitudes were found to fall into two categories, either rational or emotional. Under rational, most participants were in favour of sharing loyalty card data. Support of health research was seen as an important reason to donate such data, with loyalty card logs being considered as already within the public domain. With increased understanding of research purpose, participants expressed higher willingness to donate data. Within the emotional category, participants shared fears about revealing location information and of third parties obtaining their data. With regards to safeguards, participants described the importance of anonymisation and the level of data detail; the control, convenience and choice they desired in sharing data; and the need for transparency and data security. The change in hypothetical purpose of the data sharing, from Covid-19 to cancer research, had no impact on participants' decision to donate, although did affect their understanding of how loyalty card data could be used. Conclusions Based on interviews with the public, this study contributes recommendations for those researchers and the wider policy community seeking to obtain loyalty card data for health research. Whilst participants were largely in favour of donating loyalty card data for academic health research, information, choice and appropriate safeguards are all exposed as prerequisites upon which decisions are made.

AB Although most people present themselves as possessing prosocial traits, people differ in the extent to which they actually act prosocially in everyday life. Qualitative data that were not ostensibly collected to measure prosociality might contain information about prosocial dispositions that is not distorted by self-presentation concerns. This paper seeks to characterise charitable donors from qualitative data. We compared a manual approach of extracting predictors from participants' self-described personal strivings to two automated approaches: A summation of words predefined as prosocial and a support vector machine classifier. Although variables extracted by the support vector machine predicted donation behaviour well in the training sample (N = 984), virtually, no variables from any method significantly predicted donations in a holdout sample (N = 496). Raters' attempts to predict donations to charity based on reading participants' personal strivings were also unsuccessful. However, raters' predictions were associated with past charitable involvement. In sum, predictors derived from personal strivings did not robustly explain variation in charitable behaviour, but personal strivings may nevertheless contain some information about trait prosociality. The sparseness of personal strivings data, rather than the irrelevance of open-ended text or individual differences in goal pursuit, likely explains their limited value in predicting prosocial behaviour.

AB The use of mobile phone devices leaves digital traces which include personal data of the user's location and can be used to produce aggregated and anonymised location data. There is widespread interest in utilising different types of mobile phone location data to optimise emergency health responses within a range of settings, however until now there has been no qualitative research exploring public opinions on sharing such data. A qualitative study with 40 millennials (born between 1981-2000) across six focus groups were conducted before and after widespread news reports about the leaking of personal data on social media and a major public health incident in the UK. Thematic analysis was used to identify themes in the data. Analysis identified four main themes and five subthemes suggesting the main concepts related to attitudes and concerns were 'Control', 'Trust', 'Risks to sharing' and 'Pros and cons of data sharing'. Millennials were generally accepting of sharing different types of location data with ambulance services and a public health agency if they were able to give explicit consent and retain some personal control towards how their data would be used. The results suggest that policymakers who wish to use aggregated and anonymized mobile phone location data to improve healthcare services should focus on reassurance about how data will be used and promoting public trust.

AB This paper examines issues associated with secondary analysis of qualitative data and their implications for information behaviour scholarship. Secondary data analysis poses a range of potential challenges for data creators, but also opportunities, including the ability to expand theory to a wider context, strengthen the reliability and validity of existing theory, gain access to populations that may be difficult to access, and to promote data archiving. The paper uses as a case study of secondary data analysis the results from our re-examination of data gathered previously in the European Union project Net Children Go Mobile, drawing from the interview transcripts from the 34 children in the UK data set. Our approach to secondary analysis was reanalysis, applying a new interpretive lens to the data that necessitated new questions in order to reveal hidden layers in the data. The data was analysed for evidence of information behaviour in order to understand how mobile technologies may be changing the way that young people seek and use information. The reanalysis of the data set supported existing models of information behaviour but revealed new ways of information seeking based on the affordances of screen size and data plans.

TI Conceptualising effective symptom management in palliative care: a novel

LA English

   Hospice; Neoplasms
AB Background Pain, breathlessness and fatigue are some of the most challenging symptoms to manage in patients with advanced disease. Specialist palliative care leads to better symptom management, but factors contributing to successful symptom management in this context have not been explored. Our aim was to understand what facilitates effective symptom management in specialist palliative care within UK hospices and investigate what barriers are experienced. Methods This was a grounded theory study using qualitative semi-structured focus groups and interviews. Participants were recruited from multidisciplinary specialist palliative care teams (doctors, nurses, healthcare assistants, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, complementary therapists, social workers and chaplains) working in inpatient, outpatient and community services provided by five hospices in the United Kingdom. Results We present a novel qualitative data-derived model of effective symptom management in specialist palliative care. We describe a co-ordinated, multi-faceted, sequential approach involving a process of engagement, partnership, decision-making, and delivery. Interventions to manage symptoms are less effective in psychologically distressed patients. Our data highlights that families of patients have a key role in determining effectiveness of symptom management interventions A holistic approach by a co-ordinated, multi-disciplinary team, including support to recognise and minimise psychological distress might facilitate more effective symptom management. Barriers to symptom management include team discordance and lack of understanding about symptom management by patient and families. Conclusions Shared decision-making between patients and professionals and co-ordination of care by a multi-disciplinary team are key components of effective symptom management. Actions to address psychological distress and evaluate the understanding and expectations of patients and their families would enable more effective symptom management. A more effective multi-disciplinary approach would be facilitated by discussion within teams about role competencies and boundaries.

DT Article
ID PEOPLE; DESIGN
AB Researchers have been exploring how to manage Behavioural and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) in a personalised way, meanwhile, assistive technologies have been developed to collect a variety of personal data. This urges more research in investigating the combination of: data collected by the care team, which are mainly qualitative; and data collected by assistive technologies, the majority of which are quantitative. Previous studies, however, have yet to explore if and how a combination of quantitative and qualitative data could facilitate the care team to better understand each resident with dementia in the nursing home context for personalised BPSD management. Guided by a Research through Design approach, a prototype for collecting and visualising the quantitative and qualitative data towards personalised BPSD management was developed together with the care team. Via developing this prototype, knowledge was gained in what types of data could be combined for personalised BPSD management in nursing homes, what are their values, how to collect and present them, and how to introduce them in the working routine of the care team for analysis. The main findings suggest that the types of data to be collected could be unique for each resident with dementia; the quantitative and qualitative data are of value to each other during data collection and analysis; data collection should be quick and standardised yet flexible for the care team; the overview page is vital for data presentation; and user scenarios could be created to nudge the care team to analyse the data at certain points of their working routine. In general, a combination of qualitative data and quantitative data could help the care team to discover more insights about each resident with dementia and thus improve the current practice of personalised BPSD management.

   ON QUALITATIVE DATA
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID SYSTEMS
AB This paper presents a methodology for modelling the process of group decision making based on qualitative data. It is hypothesized that group decisions can be modelled in terms of the sharing and negotiation of the individual construct systems of the group members. Individual construct systems are elicited from each group member prior to the group decision using an open-ended sorting procedure (Canter, Brown & Groat, 1985). The combined construct system of the group is represented using a non-metric multidimensional scaling technique known as Multidimensional Scalogram Analysis (MSA). Each stage of the elicitation and representation of the construct systems is illustrated using a worked example taken from an experimental decision-making group choosing houses for student accommodation. The decision reached by the group is compared to the multidimensional model. The potential of the model for social processes research is discussed.

AB Depression in older people is common, under-recognised and often undertreated. This study aimed to explore the reasons why older people with depression may not present to primary care. Secondary analysis was carried out, of qualitative data collected in two previous studies in North-West England. Older people are reluctant to recognise and name depression as a set of symptoms that legitimises attending their general practitioner (GP). They do not consider themselves candidates for help for their distress. This is partly due to perceptions of the role of the GP but also to previous negative experiences of help seeking. In addition, treatments offered, which are predominantly biomedical, may not be acceptable to older people. Interventions offered to older people need to encourage social engagement, such as befriending, and enhancement of creative, physical and social activity.

AB Labeling or classifying textual data and qualitative evidence is an expensive and consequential challenge. The rigor and consistency behind the construction of these labels ultimately shape research findings and conclusions. A multifaceted methodological conundrum to address this challenge is the need for human reasoning for classification that leads to deeper and more nuanced understandings; however, this same manual human classification comes with the well-documented increase in classification inconsistencies and errors, particularly when dealing with vast amounts of documents and teams of coders. An alternative to human coding consists of machine learning-assisted techniques. These data science and visualization techniques offer tools for data classification that are cost-effective and consistent but are prone to losing participants' meanings or voices for two main reasons: (a) these classifications typically aggregate all texts configuring each input file (i.e., each interview transcript) into a single topic or code and (b) these words configuring texts are analyzed outside of their original contexts. To address this challenge and analytic conundrum, we present an analytic framework and software tool, that addresses the following question: How to classify vast amounts of qualitative evidence effectively and efficiently without losing context or the original voices of our research participants and while leveraging the nuances that human reasoning bring to the qualitative and mixed methods analytic tables? This framework mirrors the line-by-line coding employed in human/manual code identification but relying on machine learning to classify texts in minutes rather than months. The resulting outputs provide complete transparency of the classification process and aid to recreate the contextualized, original, and unaltered meanings embedded in the input documents, as provided by our participants. We offer access to the database (Gonzalez Canche, 2022e) and software required (Gonzalez Canche, 2022a, Mac , and Windows ) to replicate the analyses. We hope this opportunity to become familiar with the analytic framework and software, may result in expanded access of data science tools to analyze qualitative evidence (see also Gonzalez Canche 2022b, 2022c, 2022d, for related no-code data science applications to classify and analyze qualitative and textual data dynamically).

AB Purpose: To understand barriers around accessing or using workplace health promotion (WHP) programs among workers in different wage categories.
   Approach: We conducted qualitative analysis of responses to three open-ended questions about WHP program participation, collected as part of an existing WHP program evaluation. Setting: A large mid-western university.
   Participants: Of the 20,000 employees emailed an online survey, 3,212 responded (16.1%). The sample was mostly female (75%), white (79%), and comprised of staff members (84%). The average age was 44 years and 67% had annual incomes <$75,001.
   Method: We used NVivo-12 Plus and two coders to apply Grounded Theory on the open-ended questions and identify emergent themes.
   Results: Although most respondents were happy with the program, differences across wage categories emerged around time, financial incentives, commute, workload, and organizational policies/support Employees at all wage levels were enthusiastic about creating a culture of health but needed different cultural supports to do so. For instance, higher-wage workers needed to overcome self-made time constraints, while lower-wage workers needed supervisor support to overcome coverage constraints that prevented participation.
   Conclusion: The unique participation challenges experienced by employees in different wage categories provide justification for WHP programs that can better accommodate the participation barriers of all employees. While some programs may simply require more flexible offerings, supervisors may need to be trained to support and foster healthy environments.

AB Thorough data management is crucial for the protection of people who participate in research and the ability for researchers to share results with the public. The impact of inadequate adherence to data management is particularly evident in small field sites and among vulnerable populations partoicipating in Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR). CBPR presents exciting opportunities for multimedia and multi-sectoral dissemination of research results and policy change, especially concerning the impact of research on health equity for underrepresented populations. In this article, we discuss how we defined data boundaries and protections to adhere to ethical standards while also prioritizing data dissemination while using CBPR with American Indians in Arizona. Although complex partnerships can introduce additional risks to data oversight, data management practices can also increase opportunities for wide-reaching dissemination. We hope to contribute to the literature on data sharing in multi-partnership projects to bolster the impact of dissemination while also protecting participants and populations who chose to collaborate in research and policy practices.

AB Despite a growing body of research literature within dementia care, research concerning how to provide holistic quality care and its benefit for people with dementia is still scarce. In this study, a secondary analysis of original qualitative data from a former study was employed. Findings demonstrated that slow nursing embodies a holistic caring approach, which may improve the care quality provided to people with dementia. The current findings also provide key knowledge that may contribute to nursing research and education.

AB Many firms are aware that eco-innovation is an important issue in resource management practice due to its contribution to firms' competencies and capabilities. Eco-innovation represents a differentiating attribute for sustainable business in fiercely competitive environments. However, prior studies have not examined the role of eco-innovation in sustainable development through hierarchical structural analysis of resource management practice to address firms' capabilities and competencies; in particular, the attributes contain qualitative information and quantitative data. This study proposes a hybrid method comprising the fuzzy Delphi method, importance-performance analysis, and a decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory to rank the attributes and assist firms in decision-making. The result supports the use of advanced eco-friendly technologies and the selection of potential talent to support eco-innovation and foster changes in strategic vision, management structure, and administrative procedures. Clear policies and procedures, mutual trust and respect, and sales staff characteristics are needed to improve firm performance toward sustainable business. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB AimsThis study examined the perceptions of the SHARE plus intervention and its effects on communication, collaboration, and involvement in day-to-day diabetes management in older adults with Type 1 diabetes (T1D) and their care partners. BackgroundThe SHARE plus intervention includes continuous glucose monitoring with a data sharing app that allows care partners to view glucose data on a smartphone and receive alerts. People with T1D and their care partners are educated about communication strategies, problem-solving strategies, and action planning when using glucose data sharing. DesignQualitative descriptive design. MethodsOlder adults with T1D wore a continuous glucose monitor for 3 months (n = 10). Care partners (n = 10) used a data-sharing app. The SHARE plus intervention consisted of one 90-min education session. Semi-structured interviews were conducted across 10 dyads (person with diabetes and care partner) following the 12-week study. A qualitative description and a constant comparison approach were used to examine similarities and differences in experiences. Interviews were transcribed, coded, and analysed for common themes. The manuscript adheres to COREQ EQUATOR checklist. ResultsThe SHARE plus intervention increased diabetes knowledge across the dyads, improving confidence and helping partners understand how to navigate symptoms and behaviours and when to intervene. Dyads worked together to optimise diabetes management through improved communication, collaboration, and management of disagreements. Although the majority of persons with diabetes and their care partners reported no conflictual communication, disagreements about diabetes management remained in some dyads. The SHARE plus intervention impacted care partners in various ways from a psychological perspective. While live-in-care partners felt peace of mind, care partners living away from persons with diabetes had some increased worry and concern. ConclusionThe SHARE plus intervention results can help guide future development of diabetes dyadic care and education interventions using diabetes technology. Relevance to Clinical PracticeThe SHARE plus intervention is a brief, practical intervention that can help diabetes clinicians improve communication and collaboration among spouses living with older adults with T1D who use continuous glucose monitoring with data sharing. Patient ContributionA person with diabetes was part of the research team and assisted with design of the intervention and subsequent interviews and analysis.

AB This article shares the problem-solving process and resultant rapid sensemaking methodology created by an interdisciplinary research team faced with qualitative big data. Confronted with a data set of over half a million free text comments, within an existing data set of 320,500 surveys, our team developed a process to structure the naturally occurring variability within the data, to identify and isolate meaningful analytic units, and to group subsets of our data amenable to automated coding using a template-based process. This allowed a significant portion of the data to be rapidly assessed while still preserving the ability to explore the more complex free text comments with a grounded theory informed emergent process. In this discussion, we focus on strategies useful to other teams interested in fielding open-ended questions as part of large survey efforts and incorporating those findings as part of an integrated analysis.

AB Purpose The purpose of this qualitative study was to examine perceived barriers to adoption of lifestyle changes for type 2 diabetes prevention among a diverse group of low-income women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Methods A secondary data analysis of 10 semistructured focus group discussions was conducted. Participants were low-income African American, Hispanic, and Appalachian women ages 18 to 45 years who were diagnosed with GDM in the past 10 years. A qualitative content analysis was conducted to identify key themes that emerged within and between groups. Results Four key themes emerged on the role of knowledge, affordability, accessibility, and social support in type 2 diabetes prevention. Women discussed a lack of awareness of the benefits of breastfeeding and type 2 diabetes prevention, inaccessibility of resources in their local communities to help them engage in lifestyle change, and the desire for more culturally relevant education on healthful food options and proper portion sizes. Discussion Study findings suggests that to improve effectiveness of type 2 diabetes prevention efforts among low-income women with GDM history, health care providers and public health practitioners should avoid using "one-size-fits-all" approaches to lifestyle change and instead use tailored interventions that address the cultural and environmental factors that impact women's ability to engage in recommended behavior change.

AB Almost half of NHS doctors are junior doctors, while high proportions are women and/or Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic (BAME) individuals. Discrimination against this population is associated with poorer career-related outcomes and unequal representation. We aimed to qualitatively explore junior doctors' experience of workplace racial and gender-based discrimination, and its impact on their psychological distress (PD). In this study, we carried out a secondary analysis of data from a UK-based parent study about junior doctors' working cultures and conditions. Interview data was examined using thematic analysis. Transcripts (n = 14) documenting experiences of race and/or gender-based discrimination were sampled and analysed from 21 in-depth interviews conducted with UK junior doctors. Four themes were generated about the experiences and perpetrators of discrimination, the psychological impact of discrimination, and organisational interventions that tackle discrimination. Discrimination in various forms was reported, from racially charged threats to subtle microaggressions. Participants experienced profoundly elevated levels of PD, feeling fearful, undermined, and under-confident. Discrimination is associated with elevated levels of PD, whilst negatively impacting workforce sustainability and retention. This reduces the opportunity for more diversity in NHS medical leadership. We encourage NHS hospitals to review their policies about discrimination and develop in-person workshops that focus on recognising, challenging, and reporting workplace discrimination.

AB Many Americans are in poor health. This is acute for racial/ethnic minorities compared with the Non-Hispanic white population. A grounded theory approach was used to analyze semistructured qualitative interviews to identify perceptions of family-of-origin lifestyle choices in same-race and interracial couples. Several central themes emerged from the data including influence of family-of-origin eating patterns, lack of family-of-origin importance for physical activity, and romantic partner influence in eating and exercise. Findings provide evidence for the socialization of family of origin on lifestyle choices into adulthood and also suggest promising changes due to romantic partner.

AB Aim To explore healthcare providers' perceptions and experiences of the implications of a patient data-sharing agreement between National Health Service (NHS) Digital and the Home Office on access to NHS services and quality of care received by migrant patients in England.
   Design A qualitative study using semi-structured interviews, thematic analysis and constant-comparison approach.
   Participants Eleven healthcare providers and one non-clinical volunteer working in community or hospital-based settings who had experience of migrants accessing NHS England services. Interviews were carried out in 2018.
   Setting England.
   Results Awareness and understanding of the patient data-sharing agreement varied among participants, who associated this with a perceived lack of transparency by the government. Participants provided insight into how they thought the data-sharing agreement was negatively influencing migrants' health-seeking behaviour, their relationship with clinicians and the safety and quality of their care. They referred to the policy as a challenge to their core ethical principles, explicitly patient confidentiality and trust, which varied depending on their clinical specialty.
   Conclusions A perceived lack of transparency during the policy development process can result in suspicion or mistrust towards government among the health workforce, patients and public, which is underpinned by a notion of power or control. The patient data-sharing agreement was considered a threat to some of the core principles of the NHS and its implementation as adversely affecting healthcare access and patient safety. Future policy development should involve a range of stakeholders including civil society, healthcare professionals and ethicists, and include more meaningful assessments of the impact on healthcare and public health.

TI Exploring the experiences of academic libraries with research data
   management: A meta-ethnographic analysis of qualitative studies
SO LIBRARY & INFORMATION SCIENCE RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB Taking on responsibilities in research data management (RDM) has proven to be a significant challenge as libraries have adopted new roles within higher education institutions. A qualitative review using the meta-ethnographic approach was conducted that examined the experiences of academic libraries and provided clarity on contextual influences associated with achievements, as well as illuminating the reasons for deficiencies. Libraries experienced uncertainty around roles and relationships related to RDM yet were recognized positively as a neutral, centralized space within academic institutions. This perception, combined with the current approach of fostering partnerships and collaborations, may prove to be useful for libraries as they strategically consider how best to provide continued support and services in RDM. Understanding the perspectives of academic libraries on how they respond and support the demands related to RDM offers a fuller, more robust insight that is essential for planning and decision-making.

AB Opening data promises to improve research rigour and democratize knowledge production. But it also presents practical, theoretical, and ethical considerations for qualitative researchers in particular. Discussion about open data in qualitative social psychology predates the replication crisis. However, the nuances of this ongoing discussion have not been translated into current journal guidelines on open data. In this article, we summarize ongoing debates about open data from qualitative perspectives, and through a content analysis of 261 journals we establish the state of current journal policies for open data in the domain of social psychology. We critically discuss how current common expectations for open data may not be adequate for establishing qualitative rigour, can introduce ethical challenges, and may place those who wish to use qualitative approaches at a disadvantage in peer review and publication processes. We advise that future open data guidelines should aim to reflect the nuance of arguments surrounding data sharing in qualitative research, and move away from a universal "one-size-fits-all" approach to data sharing. This article outlines the past, present, and the potential future of open data guidelines in social-psychological journals. We conclude by offering recommendations for how journals might more inclusively consider the use of open data in qualitative methods, whilst recognizing and allowing space for the diverse perspectives, needs, and contexts of all forms of social-psychological research.

AB In the United States, there is mounting political pressure on public agencies to publish internal data. But transparency policy innovation brings a unique set of legal and normative challenges regarding how sensitive information will be used. It is therefore an open question as to what legal-normative conditions favour innovation. Are there specific kinds of laws, rules, or normative conditions that are related to adoption of new, potentially risky, transparency policies? In this article, qualitative comparative analysis with secondary data from multiple sources is used to find out what configurations of conditions are associated with open data use in 122 police departments. Results show three different paths to innovation among police departments: mandate driven, city-stakeholder convergence, and network learning. The findings are examined and developed through interviews with experts from a national police transparency initiative.

AB Background The advent of learning healthcare systems (LHSs) raises an important implementation challenge concerning how to request and manage consent to support secondary use of data in learning cycles, particularly research activities. Current consent models in Quebec were not established with the context of LHSs in mind and do not support the agility and transparency required to obtain consent from all involved, especially the citizens. Therefore, a new approach to consent is needed. Previous work identified the meta-consent model as a promising alternative to fulfill the requirements of LHSs, particularly large-scale deployments. We elicited the public's attitude toward the meta-consent model to evaluate if the model could be understood by the citizens and would be deemed acceptable to prepare for its possible implementation in Quebec. Methods Eight focus groups, with a total of 63 members of the general public from various backgrounds were conducted in Quebec, Canada, in 2019. Explicit attention was given to literacy levels, language spoken at home and rural vs urban settings. We assessed attitudes, concerns and facilitators regarding key components of the meta-consent model: predefined categories to personalized consent requests, a dynamic web-based infrastructure to record meta-consent, and default settings. To analyse the discussions, a thematic content analysis was performed using a qualitative software. Results Our findings showed that participants were supportive of this new approach of consent as it promotes transparency and offers autonomy for the management of their health data. Key facilitators were identified to be considered in the implementation of a meta-consent model in the Quebec LHSs: information and transparency, awareness campaigns, development of educational tools, collaboration of front-line healthcare professionals, default settings deemed acceptable by the society as well as close partnerships with recognized and trusted institutions. Conclusions This qualitative study reveals the openness of a sample of the Quebec population regarding the meta-consent model for secondary use of health data for research. This first exploratory study conducted with the public is an important step in guiding decision-makers in the next phases of implementing the various strategies to support access and use of health data in Quebec.

AB This paper describes a distributed collaborative effort between industry and academia to systematize data management in an academic biomedical laboratory. Heterogeneous and voluminous nature of research data created in biomedical laboratories make information management difficult and research unproductive. One such collaborative effort was evaluated over a period of four years using data collection methods including ethnographic observations, semi-structured interviews, web-based surveys, progress reports, conference call summaries, and face-to-face group discussions. Data were analyzed using qualitative methods of data analysis to (1) characterize specific problems faced by biomedical researchers with traditional information management practices, (2) identify intervention areas to introduce a new research information management system called Labmatrix, and finally to (3) evaluate and delineate important general collaboration (intervention) characteristics that can optimize outcomes of an implementation process in biomedical laboratories. Results emphasize the importance of end user perseverance, human-centric interoperability evaluation, and demonstration of return on investment of effort and time of laboratory members and industry personnel for success of implementation process. In addition, there is an intrinsic learning component associated with the implementation process of an information management system. Technology transfer experience in a complex environment such as the biomedical laboratory can be eased with use of information systems that support human and cognitive interoperability. Such informatics features can also contribute to successful collaboration and hopefully to scientific productivity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background A psychosocial dementia care programme for challenging behaviour (DEMBASE (R)) was developed in collaboration with a Swedish BPSD-registry team for in-home care services use in Japan. The programme consisted of a web-based tool for the continued assessment of challenging behaviours and interdisciplinary discussion meetings. Effectiveness of the adapted programme was verified through a cluster-randomised controlled trial. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government provided municipal funding to introduce the programme into daily practice beginning in April 2018.
   Objectives To investigate both facilitators and barriers associated with programme implementation.
   Design A secondary analysis of qualitative and quantitative data.
   Settings Data were collected in naturalistic long-term care settings from April 2018 to March 2019.
   Participants A total of 138 professionals and 157 people with dementia participated in the programme.
   Methods Challenging behaviour in persons with dementia was assessed by professionals using a total Neuropsychiatric Inventory score. Data on expected facilitators and barriers were extracted for qualitative analysis from a debriefing meeting between professionals.
   Results Of the 157 persons with dementia, 81 (51.6%) received follow-up behavioural evaluations by March 2019. The average level of challenging behaviour was significantly reduced for 81 persons from baseline to their most recent follow-up evaluations. Facilitators included 'programme available for care managers', 'visualised feedback on professionals' work', 'affordable for providers and professionals' and 'media coverage'. Barriers included 'professionals from different organisations', 'unpaid work', 'operation requirement for municipalities' and 'conflict with daily benefit-oriented framework'.
   Conclusions A follow-up evaluation was not fully achieved. Further strategies to address barriers may include the development of a benefit-rewarding scheme for interdisciplinary discussion meetings, an e-learning system capable of substituting training course portions and a cross-municipality training course.

TI Sociological variety and the transmission efficiency of Mycobacterium
   tuberculosis: a secondary analysis of qualitative and quantitative data
   from 15 communities in Zambia
SO BMJ OPEN
LA English
DT Article
ID SOCIAL CONTACT; PREVALENCE; ZAMSTAR; STIGMA; BURDEN
AB Objectives Selected Zambian communities formed part of a duster randomised trial: the Zambia and South Africa TB and AIDS Reduction study (ZAMSTAR). There was wide variability in the prevalence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and tuberculosis (TB) disease across these communities. We sought to clarify whether specific communities could have been more/less vulnerable to M. tuberculosis transmission as a result of sociological variety relevant to transmission efficiency.
   Design We conducted a mixed methods secondary analysis using existing data sets. First, we analysed qualitative data to categorise and synthesise patterns of socio-spatial engagement across communities. Second, we compared emergent sociological variables with a measure of transmission efficiency: the ratio of the annual risk of infection to TB prevalence.
   Setting ZAMSTAR communities in urban and peri-urban Zambia, spanning five provinces.
   Participants Fifteen communities, each served by a health facility offering TB treatment to a population of at least 25 000. TB notification rates were at least 400 per 100 000 per annum and HIV seroprevalence was estimated to be high.
   Results Crowding, movement, livelihoods and participation in recreational activity differed across communities. Based on 12 socio-spatial indicators, communities were qualitatively classified as more/ less spatially crowded and as more/less socially 'open' to contact with others, with implications for the presumptive risk of M. tuberculosis transmission. For example, watching video shows in poorly ventilated structures posed a presumptive risk in more socially open communities, while outdoor farming and/or fishing were particularly widespread in communities with lower transmission measures.
   Conclusions A dual dynamic of 'social permeability' and crowding appeared relevant to disparities in M. tuberculosis transmission efficiency. To reduce transmission, certain socio-spatial aspects could be adjusted (eg, increasing ventilation on transport), while more structural aspects are less malleable (eg, reliance on public transport). We recommend integrating community level typologies with genome sequencing techniques to further explore the significance of 'social permeability'.

TI Using data and quality monitoring to enhance maternity outcomes: a
   qualitative study of risk managers' perspectives
SO BMJ QUALITY & SAFETY
LA English
DT Article
ID CARE
AB Introduction Risk management is a core part of healthcare practice, especially within maternity services, where litigation and societal costs are high. There has been little investigation into the experiences and opinions of those staff directly involved in risk management: lead obstetricians and specialist risk midwives, who are ideally placed to identify how current implementation of risk management strategies can be improved.
   Methods A qualitative study of consultant-led maternity units in an English region. Semistructured interviews were conducted with the obstetric and midwifery risk management leads for each unit. We explored their approach to risk management, particularly their opinions regarding quality monitoring and related barriers/issues. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and thematically analysed.
   Results Twenty-seven staff from 12/15 maternity units participated. Key issues identified included: concern for the accuracy and validity of their local data, potential difficulties related to data collation, the negative impact of external interference by national regulatory bodies on local clinical priorities, the influence of the local culture of the maternity unit on levels of engagement in the risk management process, and scepticism about the value of benchmarking of maternity units without adjustment for population characteristics.
   Conclusions Local maternity risk managers may provide valuable, clinically relevant insights into current issues in clinical data monitoring. Improvements should focus on the accuracy and ease of data collation with a need for an agreed maternity indicators set, populated from validated databases, and not reliant on data collection systems that distract clinicians from patient activity and quality improvement. It is clear that working relationships between risk managers, their own clinical teams and external national bodies require improvement and alignment. Further discussion regarding benchmarking between maternity units is required prior to implementation. These findings are likely to be relevant to other clinical specialties.

AB Objective: To extend our understanding of self-management by using original data and a recent concept analysis to propose a unifying framework for self-management strategies.
   Methods: Longitudinal interview data with 117 people with neurological conditions were used to test a preliminary framework derived from the literature. Statements from the interviews were sorted according to the predefined categories of the preliminary framework to investigate the fit between the framework and the qualitative data. Data on frequencies of strategies complemented the qualitative analysis.
   Results: The Taxonomy of Every Day Self-management Strategies (TEDSS) Framework includes five Goal-oriented Domains (Internal, Social Interaction, Activities, Health Behaviour and Disease Controlling), and two additional Support-oriented Domains (Process and Resource). The Support-oriented Domain strategies (such as information seeking and health navigation) are not, in and of themselves, goal focused. Instead, they underlie and support the Goal-oriented Domain strategies. Together, the seven domains create a comprehensive and unified framework for understanding how people with neurological conditions self-manage all aspects of everyday life.
   Conclusions: The resulting TEDSS Framework provides a taxonomy that has potential to resolve conceptual confusion within the field of self-management science.
   Practice Implications: The TEDSS Framework may help to guide health service delivery and research. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

ID TOOL
AB Mind mapping is a visual-spatial method of representing information using nodes (information segments) to show ideas and connecting lines to define relationships between content. As a critical thinking tool, it is applicable to a range of research activities, including information management, project development, and data analysis. The purposes of this manuscript are to describe the use of mapping for qualitative data analysis, provide step-by-step instructions of how to construct mind maps, and present examples specific to qualitative data analysis. An example from a recent study of patient and provider perceptions of virtual visits demonstrates the use of Xmind in conjunction with Atlas.ti for qualitative content analysis of open-ended survey data. While coding in Atlas.ti, we used Xmind to develop dynamic memos, code networks, and themes. The memo map served to identify common coding patterns and informed subsequent coding stages. After coding in Atlas.ti, the entire code list was imported into a new map in Xmind and iteratively organized to identify conceptual groupings, similarities/differences, and key ideas. Themes were identified through pattern coding and refining code networks within the Xmind map. Map iterations formed part of the analytic trail and facilitated peer-to-peer discussions. The final map served as the model for publication. The use of mind mapping enhanced the rigor, credibility, and transparency of analyses and facilitated peer-to-peer communication. This technique can be used to manage diverse content (documents, audio/video file, image, web links, and personal notes) and thus has great potential to contribute to a variety of data management tasks.

AB BackgroundMen generally have higher rates of suicide, despite fewer overt indicators of risk. Differences in presentation and response suggest a need to better understand why suicide prevention is less effective for men.
   ObjectiveTo explore the views of at-risk men, friends and family about the tensions inherent in suicide prevention and to consider how prevention may be improved.
   DesignSecondary analysis of qualitative interview and focus group data, using thematic analysis techniques, alongside bracketing, construction and contextualisation.
   Setting and participantsA total of 35 men who had recently made a suicide attempt participated in interviews, and 47 family and friends of men who had made a suicide attempt took part in focus groups. Participants recounted their experiences with men's suicide attempts and associated interventions, and suggested ways in which suicide prevention may be improved.
   ResultsFive tensions in perspectives emerged between men and their support networks, which complicated effective management of suicide risk: (i) respecting privacy vs monitoring risk, (ii) differentiating normal vs risky behaviour changes, (iii) familiarity vs anonymity in personal information disclosure, (iv) maintaining autonomy vs imposing constraints to limit risk, and (v) perceived need for vs failures of external support services.
   ConclusionTension between the different perspectives increased systemic stress, compounding problems and risk, thereby decreasing the effectiveness of detection of and interventions for men at risk of suicide. Suggested solutions included improving risk communication, reducing reliance on single source supports and increasing intervention flexibility in response to individual needs.

AB Background: The sequence used for collecting quantitative and qualitative data in concurrent mixed-methods research may influence participants' responses. Empirical evidence is needed to determine if the order of data collection in concurrent mixed methods research biases participants' responses to closed and open-ended questions.
   Objectives: To examine the influence of the quantitative-qualitative sequence on responses to closed and open-ended questions when assessing the same variables or aspects of a phenomenon simultaneously within the same study phase.
   Design: A descriptive cross-sectional, concurrent mixed-methods design was used to collect quantitative (survey) and qualitative (interview) data. The setting was a large multi-site health care centre in Canada.
   Methods: A convenience sample of 50 registered nurses was selected and participated in the study. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two sequences for data collection, quantitative-qualitative or qualitative-quantitative.
   Analysis: Independent t-tests were performed to compare the two groups' responses to the survey items. Directed content analysis was used to compare the participants' responses to the interview questions.
   Results: The sequence of data collection did not greatly affect the participants' responses to the closed-ended questions (survey items) or the open-ended questions (interview questions).
   Conclusions: The sequencing of data collection, when using both survey and semi-structured interviews, may not bias participants' responses to closed or open-ended questions. Additional research is required to confirm these findings. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Distinctive longitudinal narrative data, collected during a critical 18-year period in the history of the HIV epidemic, offer a unique opportunity to examine how young Africans are making sense of evolving developments in HIV prevention and treatment. More than 200,000 young people from across sub-Saharan Africa took part in HIV-themed scriptwriting contests held at eight discrete time points between 1997 and 2014, creating more than 75,000 narratives. This article describes the data reduction and management strategies developed for our cross-national and longitudinal study of these qualitative data. The study aims to inform HIV communication practice by identifying cultural meanings and contextual factors that inform sexual behaviors and social practices, and also to help increase understanding of processes of sociocultural change. We describe our sampling strategies and our triangulating methodologies, combining in-depth narrative analysis, thematic qualitative analysis, and quantitative analysis, which are designed to enable systematic comparison without sacrificing ethnographic richness.

TI Needs and fears of young people presenting at accident and emergency

SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
LA English

ID ATTITUDES; FORUM; PERCEPTIONS; COMMUNITY; STAFF; CARE
AB Background
   Presentation at an accident and emergency (A&E) department is a key opportunity to engage with a young person who self-harms. The needs of this vulnerable group and their fears about presenting to healthcare services, including A&E, are poorly understood.
   Aims
   To examine young people's perceptions of A&E treatment following self-harm and their views on what constitutes a positive clinical encounter.
   Method
   Secondary analysis of qualitative data from an experimental online discussion forum. Threads selected for secondary analysis represent the views of 31 young people aged 16-25 with experience of self-harm.
   Results
   Participants reported avoiding A&E whenever possible, based on their own and others' previous poor experiences. When forced to seek emergency care, they did so with feelings of shame and unworthiness. These feelings were reinforced when they received what they perceived as punitive treatment from A&E staff, perpetuating a cycle of shame, avoidance and further self-harm. Positive encounters were those in which they received 'treatment as usual', i. e. non-discriminatory care, delivered with kindness, which had the potential to challenge negative self-evaluation and break the cycle.
   Conclusions
   The clinical needs of young people who self-harm continue to demand urgent attention. Further hypothesis testing and trials of different models of care delivery for this vulnerable group are warranted.

AB Purpose: Low adherence to medication via nebulisers is linked to poor clinical outcomes for people with Cystic Fibrosis (PWCF). Advances in technology allow electronic monitoring of nebuliser usage and feedback of objective adherence data to PWCF and clinical teams caring for them. CFHealthHub is a new intervention that collects and displays objective adherence data in easy-to-read formats with the aim of improving nebuliser adherence and health. There is little understanding of how objective adherence data is perceived by PWCF and healthcare professionals (HCPs). Patients and Methods: A qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with 22 PWCF and 31 HCPs who had used the CFHealthHub intervention. Results: Objective adherence data was welcomed by the majority of PWCF in the sample, and HCP delivering the intervention, because the data allowed PWCF to reflect on patterns of adherence or non-adherence. Ease of use and characteristics of data display were important, particularly the use of a "traffic light" system to allow PWCF to easily see if they were meeting their adherence targets. For PWCF objective adherence data was used as "proof to self", offering reassurance to high adherers, and a wake-up call to those with lower levels of adherence. It could also provide 'proof to others' where PWCF had higher levels of adherence than HCP or family members believed. The data could sometimes change HCP perceptions of PWCF's identities as poor adherers. Where adherence was not high, data was used to facilitate honest discussions between PWCF and HCPs about how to increase adherence. HCPs perceived that it was important to use the data positively to motivate, rather than criticise, PWCF. Conclusion: Objective nebuliser adherence data in CFHealthHub can offer proof of adherence to PWCF and HCPs. It is important to use it constructively to facilitate discussions on how to improve adherence.

DT Article
DE Data quality; Health information system; Monitoring and evaluation
ID PRISM FRAMEWORK; SCALE-UP; HIV; INTERVENTIONS; PROGRAM
AB Background: Ensuring that data collected through national health information systems are of sufficient quality for meaningful interpretation is a challenge in many resource-limited countries. An assessment was conducted to identify strengths and weaknesses of the health data management and reporting systems that capture and transfer routine monitoring and evaluation (M&E) data in Botswana.
   Methods: This was a descriptive, qualitative assessment. In-depth interviews were conducted at the national (n = 27), district (n = 31), and facility/community (n = 71) levels to assess i) M&E structures, functions, and capabilities; ii) indicator definitions and reporting guidelines; iii) data collection forms and tools; iv) data management processes; and v) links with the national reporting system. A framework analysis was conducted using ATLAS.ti v6.1.
   Results: Health programs generally had standardized data collection and reporting tools and defined personnel for M&E responsibilities at the national and district levels. Best practices unique to individual health programs were identified and included a variety of relatively low-resource initiatives such as attention to staffing patterns, making health data more accessible for evidence-based decision-making, developing a single source of information related to indicator definitions, data collection tools, and management processes, and utilization of supportive supervision visits to districts and facilities. Weakness included limited ownership of M&E-related duties within facilities, a lack of tertiary training programs to build M&E skills, few standard practices related to confidentiality and document storage, limited dissemination of indicator definitions, and limited functionality of electronic data management systems.
   Conclusions: Addressing fundamental M&E system issues, further standardization of M&E practices, and increasing health services management responsiveness to time-sensitive information are critical to sustain progress related to health service delivery in Botswana. In addition to high-resource initiatives, such as investments in electronic medical record systems and tertiary training programs, there are a variety of low-resource initiatives, such as regular data quality checks, that can strengthen national health information systems. Applying best practices that are effective within one health program to data management and reporting systems of other programs is a practical approach for strengthening health informatics and improving data quality.

AB Background: Deviations from local policy and national recommended best practice are common in the administration of intravenous infusions, but not all result in negative consequences. Some are the result of nurses' clinical judgement However, little is known about such practices and their effects on the safety of intravenous infusions. Our objective was to explore ways in which nurses contribute to system-level resilience when administering intravenous infusions.
   Methods: We conducted a secondary analysis of qualitative data from debriefs and focus groups from a mixed methods study of errors and policy deviations in intravenous infusion administration across 16 English hospitals. Analysis focused on nurses' contributions to system-level resilience, drawing on Larcos's et al. framework of types of resilience.
   Results: Five types of system-level resilience were identified in nurses' behaviour: anticipatory resilience, responsive resilience, resilience based on past experience, workarounds and nurses performing informal 'risk assessments' in relation to how best to treat individual patients. Examples of practices contributing to infusion safety were found for each of these types of resilience.
   Conclusion: Our findings suggest nurses are a key source of system-level resilience. Some behaviours that may be considered deviations from policy or best practice are the result of reasoned clinical judgement to improve infusion safety in response to the specific situation at hand. Adaptive behaviour is necessary to cope with the complexity of practice. There is a tension between standardisation and supporting flexibility in safety management. (C) 2019 The Authors.

AB The governments worldwide have attached great importance to open government data (OGD), and many OGD projects have emerged in recent years. However, the performance of OGD greatly differs in various districts and governments. Therefore, the influencing factors of OGD performance should be explored. However, the existing research has not yet established a systematic analytical framework for OGD performance, and the explanation degree of performance differences in OGD implementation is limited. Thus, this study takes technical management capacity, financial resource, organization arrangement, rules and regulations, organization culture, public demand, and inter-government competition as antecedent conditions under the perspective of technology-organization-environment framework and resource-based theory. From the cases of 16 provincial OGD practice in China, we employ fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis to explore the influencing mechanism of the interaction and coordination of multiple conditions on OGD performance. Results indicate that OGD performance depends on the integration of the total effect of various factors. Moreover, four configurational paths could be utilized to achieve high OGD performance, namely, organization-balanced path, organization-environment path, balanced path, and organization-technology path. Furthermore, a substitution relationship exists among different conditional variables, which points out the direction and focus of the implementation of OGD for governments with different endowment characteristics. This study enriches the existing studies of OGD implementation and provides references for OGD practice.

AB BackgroundResearch funders, regulatory agencies, and journals are increasingly expecting that individual-level data from health research will be shared. Broad consent to such sharing is considered appropriate, feasible and acceptable in low- and middle-income settings, but to date limited empirical research has been conducted to inform the design of such processes. We examined stakeholder perspectives about how best to seek broad consent to sharing data from the Mahidol Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit, which implemented a data sharing policy and broad consent to data sharing in January 2016.MethodsBetween February and August 2017 qualitative data were collected at two sites, Bangkok and the Thai-Myanmar border town of Mae Sot. We conducted eighteen semi-structured interviews. We also conducted four focus group discussions with a total of nineteen people. Descriptive and thematic coding informed analysis of aspects of data sharing that are considered most important to inform participants about, and the best ways to explain complex and abstract topics relating to data sharing.ResultsThe findings demonstrated that clinical trial participants prioritise information about the potential benefits and harms of data sharing. Stakeholders made multiple suggestions for clarifying information provided about data sharing on such topics. There was significant variation amongst stakeholders' perspectives about how much information should be provided about data sharing, and it was clear that effective information provision should be responsive to the study, the study population, the individual research participant and the research context.ConclusionsEffectively communicating about data sharing with research participants is challenging in practice, highlighting the importance of robust and effective data sharing governance in this context. Broad consent should incorporate effective and efficient explanations of data sharing to promote informed decision-making, without impeding research participants' understandings of key aspects of the research from which data will be shared. Further work is required to refine both the development of core information about data sharing to be provided to all research participants, and appropriate solutions for context specific-challenges arising when explaining data sharing.

TI Public responses to the sharing and linkage of health data for research
   purposes: a systematic review and thematic synthesis of qualitative
   studies

AB Background: The past 10 years have witnessed a significant growth in sharing of health data for secondary uses. Alongside this there has been growing interest in the public acceptability of data sharing and data linkage practices. Public acceptance is recognised as crucial for ensuring the legitimacy of current practices and systems of governance. Given the growing international interest in this area this systematic review and thematic synthesis represents a timely review of current evidence. It highlights the key factors influencing public responses as well as important areas for further research.
   Methods: This paper reports a systematic review and thematic synthesis of qualitative studies examining public attitudes towards the sharing or linkage of health data for research purposes. Twenty-five studies were included in the review. The included studies were conducted primarily in the UK and North America, with one study set in Japan, another in Sweden and one in multiple countries. The included studies were conducted between 1999 and 2013 (eight studies selected for inclusion did not report data collection dates). The qualitative methods represented in the studies included focus groups, interviews, deliberative events, dialogue workshops and asynchronous online interviews.
   Results: Key themes identified across the corpus of studies related to the conditions necessary for public support/acceptability, areas of public concern and implications for future research. The results identify a growing body of evidence pointing towards widespread general-though conditional-support for data linkage and data sharing for research purposes. Whilst a variety of concerns were raised (e.g. relating to confidentiality, individuals' control over their data, uses and abuses of data and potential harms arising) in cases where participants perceived there to be actual or potential public benefits from research and had trust in the individuals or organisations conducting and/or overseeing data linkage/sharing, they were generally supportive. The studies also find current low levels of awareness about existing practices and uses of data.
   Conclusions: Whilst the results indicate widespread (conditional) public support for data sharing and linkage for research purposes, a range of concerns exist. In order to ensure public support for future research uses of data greater awareness raising combined with opportunities for public engagement and deliberation are needed. This will be essential for ensuring the legitimacy of future health informatics research and avoiding further public controversy.

AB This paper describes the views of new graduate nurses on what factors they believe are important contributors for successful transition to registered nurse practice. Transition from student to new graduate nurse is challenging and stressful, with health care providers expecting graduates to "hit the ground running". The reality is that most graduates experience role adjustment difficulties and require support from senior colleagues within health care organisations. Drawing on a larger Australian study that examined pre-registration paid employment and its impact on graduate nurse transition, findings in this paper suggest that successful transition is linked to post-registration or employer factors and less so to pre-registration paid employment factors. Utilising interpretive description of two qualitative data sets; three organising themes were identified: a matching skill set, the beginning foundation and a job well done. The global theme, valuing beginning practice describes newly qualified nurse's views on being valued by the nursing profession and how they were accepted into the work environment. Despite the stressors faced by the majority of new graduate nurses adjusting to the rigours of practice, graduate transition can be improved by supportive institutional practices and fostering collegial respect. Successful graduate nurse transition improves job satisfaction and is an effective strategy to address the ongoing pressures of recruitment and retention of new graduates. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background This is a multi-method, in-depth, three part qualitative study exploring the regulation and practice of secondary research with tissue and data in a high-income country. We explore and compare the perspectives of researchers, research ethics committees (RECs) and other relevant professionals (e.g. pathologists and clinicians). We focus on points of contention because they demonstrate misalignment between the expectations, values and assumptions of these stakeholders. Methods This is a multi-method study using observational research, focus groups and interviews with 42 participants (conducted 2016-2017) and analyzed using thematic analysis. Results Results are arranged under the following themes: consent; balancing the social value of the research with consent requirements; and harm. Our findings demonstrate different perspectives on the review process, styles of ethical reasoning and issues of concern. First, researchers and RECs disagreed about whether the cost of re-consenting patients satisfied the criterion of impracticability for consent waivers. Second, most researchers were skeptical that secondary research with already collected tissue and data could harm patients. Researchers often pointed to the harm arising from a failure to use existing material for research. RECs were concerned about the potential for secondary research to stigmatize communities. Third, researchers adopted a more consequentialist approach to decision-making, including some willingness to trade off the benefit of the research against the cost of getting consent; whereas RECs were more deontological and typically considered research benefit only after it had been established that re-consent was impractical. Conclusion This research highlights ways in which RECs and researchers may be talking past each other, resulting in confusion and frustration. These finding provide a platform for realignment of the expectations of RECs and researchers, which could contribute to making research ethics review more effective.

AB Purpose
   This paper aims to understand how the tasks of management accountants (MA) are affected by data analytics (DA).
   Design/methodology/approach
   A qualitative methodology was deemed most appropriate given the exploratory nature of the research questions (RQ). In total, 10 open-ended interview questions were used to gather the evidence. The case study design was inductive, yielding rich data from 29 respondents representing 20 different organizations.
   Findings
   Answers were provided to three interrelated RQs about the use of DA by MA, namely, what are their responsibilities? How does this work support inference, prediction and assurance? And how can they ensure insights from DA can be turned into decisions that add value? The findings also indicate that MA have not taken charge of the data analytic opportunities and at present, their activities remain largely focused on descriptive and financial data analysis rather than more complex activities using external data, operational data and modeling.
   Research limitations/implications
   The limitation of this research is that it is based on a relatively small, geographically restricted sample (20 organizations in south-central Canada) as well by interviews that were only 60 min in duration.
   Practical implications
   Provides a base for the existing practice of management accounting with DA.
   Social implications
   Explains the social relationship between DA and management accounting.
   Originality/value
   Documented and explained the extent of actual DA use by MA.

AB Background: Little research exists regarding how real-time continuous glucose monitoring (RT-CGM) data sharing plays a role in the relationship between patients and their care partners. Objective: To (1) identify the benefits and challenges related to RT-CGM data sharing from the patient and care partner perspective and (2) to explore the number and type of individuals who share and follow RT-CGM data. Methods: This qualitative content analysis was conducted by examining publicly available blogs focused on RT-CGM and data sharing. A thematic analysis of blogs and associated comments was conducted. Results: A systematic appraisal of personal blogs examined 39 blogs with 206 corresponding comments. The results of the study provided insight about the benefits and challenges related to individuals with diabetes sharing their RT-CGM data with a care partner(s). The analysis resulted in three themes: (1) RT-CGM data sharing enhances feelings of safety, (2) the need to communicate boundaries to avoid judgment, and (3) choice about sharing and following RT-CGM data. RT-CGM data sharing occurred within dyads (n=46), triads (n=15), and tetrads (n=2). Conclusions: Adults and children with type 1 diabetes and their care partners are empowered by the ability to share and follow RT-CGM data. Our findings suggest that RT-CGM data sharing between an individual with diabetes and their care partner can complicate relationships. Healthcare providers need to engage patients and care partners in discussions about best practices related to RT-CGM sharing and following to avoid frustrations within the relationship.

AB Open science provides transparency to research processes by means of open data as data sharing initiates. The need for data sharing among scholars and researchers was evident, the uptake however is slow due to the benefits and detriments of the practices. This paper explores the perceptions of Nigerian academics towards research data sharing practices. Participants from five universities in Nigeria were purposively sampled. Data were gathered through interviews with 22 participants. Their perception towards data sharing was reflected through their awareness, understanding and familiarity of the practice. Most of the participants perceived that data sharing would add value to their professional reputation and fast-track their research progression, however a few of them perceived data sharing as disquieting. The academics labelled data privacy and cultural orientation to be those risks associated with data sharing. The study provides deeper understanding of data sharing and the opportunity for academics to know diverse insights of data sharing practices that would guide scholars in intensifying a variety of data management services, which then can be personalized to their exclusive needs. Further investigation could be done through quantitative research approach to inform data sharing behavior in a larger scale in order to improve the current practices.

AB Background Growing evidence suggests a role of lifestyle modification in improved health outcomes for people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS); however, perspectives of pwMS who engage in lifestyle modification are lacking. Objective We explored perspectives of pwMS regarding the modification of lifestyle-related risk factors in multiple sclerosis (MS) for disease management to understand attitudes to and experiences of lifestyle modification as part of self-management from a patient perspective. Design Participants were >= 18 years and English speaking who responded to a free-text open-ended question in the Health Outcomes and Lifestyle In a Sample of pwMS (HOLISM), an international online survey. Responses were analysed utilizing inductive thematic analysis. Results Under the exploration of lifestyle modification, themes describing the experiences and attitudes of participants included practical challenges and physical and psychological barriers, enablers of change and experienced outcomes. Although participants reported some practical and psychological challenges to adoption and maintenance of lifestyle behaviours, many expressed an ability to gain control of MS through engagement with lifestyle behaviours and the development of hope and optimism that accompanied this sense of control, at times leading to a sense of personal transformation. Conclusion Findings highlight the challenges experienced by pwMS in adopting lifestyle modifications for disease management as well as the positive benefits from following healthy lifestyle behaviours. Our findings may form the basis of more focussed qualitative explorations of the experiences and outcomes of lifestyle modification in MS in the future. Patient Contribution Consenting pwMS completed a survey capturing data on demographics, clinical course, lifestyle behaviours and health outcomes.

AB Qualitative research in psychology has tended to draw on a relatively narrow range of research methods, and the recent shift towards In the analysis of material involving 'naturally occurring talk' in some areas of psychology has reinforced this trend. This article discusses the implications of a preference for the analysis of 'naturally occurring talk' or 'naturalistic records' across the full range of qualitative psychology research. In particular, I focus on how researchers are positioned in debates over the advantages and limitations of analysing 'naturally occurring data' and research interviews. Drawing on examples from a current project concerned with the meanings of consumption for young people, I interrogate the assumptions associated with a preference for analysing 'naturalistic records' and consider some of the benefits as well as the problems involved in using research practices that involve a degree of direct engagement between the researcher and other participants. This article is therefore discussing the origins as well as the implications of the preference for analysing 'naturally occurring.

AB Purpose To determine the effectiveness of telephone motivational coaching delivered by veteran peers to improve mental health (MH) treatment engagement among veterans.
   Methods Veterans receiving primary care from primarily rural VA community-based outpatient clinics were enrolled. Veterans not engaged in MH treatment screening positive for >= 1 MH problem(s) were randomized to receive veteran peer-delivered feedback on MH screen results and referrals plus 4 sessions of telephone motivational coaching (intervention) versus veteran peer-delivered MH results and referrals without motivational coaching (control). Blinded telephone assessments were conducted at baseline, 8, 16, and 32 weeks. Cox proportional hazard models compared MH clinician-directed treatment initiation between groups; descriptive analyses compared MH treatment retention, changes in MH symptoms, quality of life, and self-care.
   Findings Among 272 veterans screening positive for >= 1 MH problem(s), 45% who received veteran peer telephone motivational coaching versus 46% of control participants initiated MH treatment (primary outcome) (hazard ratio: 1.09, 95% CI: 0.76-1.57), representing no between-group differences. In contrast, veterans receiving veteran peer motivational coaching achieved significantly greater improvements in depression, posttraumatic stress disorder and cannabis use scores, quality of life domains, and adoption of some self-care strategies than controls (secondary outcomes). Qualitative data revealed that veterans who received veteran peer motivational coaching may no longer have perceived a need for MH treatment.
   Conclusions Among veterans with MH problems using predominantly rural VA community clinics, telephone peer motivational coaching did not enhance MH treatment engagement, but instead had positive effects on MH symptoms, quality of life indicators, and use of self-care strategies.

AB Background: Electronic health records are widely acknowledged to provide an important opportunity to anonymize patient-level health care data and collate across populations to support research. Nonetheless, in the wake of public and policy concerns about security and inappropriate use of data, conventional approaches toward data governance may no longer be sufficient to respect and protect individual privacy. One proposed solution to improve transparency and public trust is known as Dynamic Consent, which uses information technology to facilitate a more explicit and accessible opportunity to opt out. In this case, patients can tailor preferences about whom they share their data with and can change their preferences reliably at any time. Furthermore, electronic systems provide opportunities for informing patients about data recipients and the results of research to which their data have contributed.
   Objective: To explore patient perspectives on the use of anonymized health care data for research purposes. To evaluate patient perceptions of a Dynamic Consent model and electronic system to enable and implement ongoing communication and collaboration between patients and researchers.
   Methods: A total of 26 qualitative interviews and three focus groups were conducted that included a video presentation explaining the reuse of anonymized electronic patient records for research. Slides and tablet devices were used to introduce the Dynamic Consent system for discussion. A total of 35 patients with chronic rheumatic disease with varying levels of illness and social deprivation were recruited from a rheumatology outpatient clinic; 5 participants were recruited from a patient and public involvement health research network.
   Results: Patients were supportive of sharing their anonymized electronic patient record for research, but noted a lack of transparency and awareness around the use of data, making it difficult to secure public trust. While there were general concerns about detrimental consequences of data falling into the wrong hands, such as insurance companies, 39 out of 40 (98%) participants generally considered that the altruistic benefits of sharing health care data outweighed the risks. Views were mostly positive about the use of an electronic interface to enable greater control over consent choices, although some patients were happy to share their data without further engagement. Participants were particularly enthusiastic about the system as a means of enabling feedback regarding data recipients and associated research results, noting that this would improve trust and public engagement in research. This underlines the importance of patient and public involvement and engagement throughout the research process, including the reuse of anonymized health care data for research. More than half of patients found the touch screen interface easy to use, although a significant minority, especially those with limited access to technology, expressed some trepidation and felt they may need support to use the system.
   Conclusions: Patients from a range of socioeconomic backgrounds viewed a digital system for Dynamic Consent positively, in particular, feedback about data recipients and research results. Implementation of a digital Dynamic Consent system would require careful interface design and would need to be located within a robust data infrastructure; it has the potential to improve trust and engagement in electronic medical record research.

AB This study aimed to clarify the frequency of and temporal changes in the content of mothers' free written opinions obtained in the Fukushima Health Management Survey Pregnancy and Birth Survey from 2011 to 2013. A self-administered questionnaire was mailed to women who delivered babies in Fukushima Prefecture. The questionnaire asked about maternal and child health. Expression of mothers' concerns about radiation decreased over time. Common to the top 5 codes across the 3 years were "radiation effect on fetus and infant" and "information provision including survey results." Participants who wrote free opinions were significantly more likely to be aged >= 30 years and to have depressive symptoms. Our descriptive analysis of the qualitative data showed a clear shift in mothers' concerns from radiation-related issues to their own physical and mental health. Mothers who expressed concerns were more likely to report negative physical and mental health.

AB Objective: To explore women's experiences of initiating and continuing breast or formula feeding shortly after birth in Ireland's maternity hospitals and units, as well as at home after birth. Design: Mixed methods secondary analysis of qualitative and quantitative data from the Irish National Maternity Experience Survey 2020.Setting: All 19 maternity hospitals and units in the Republic of Ireland and the national home births service. Women were asked about their maternity care experiences, including antenatal care, care during labour and birth, feeding, and care at home after birth. Participants: A total of 3,205 women who gave birth in October or November 2019 participated in the study (50% response rate). Measurements: Free-text comments related to women's experiences of initiating and continuing breast or formula feeding were analysed using thematic analysis. Quantitative data were described using means (SD) and frequencies and percentages.Findings: In the first few days after birth, 41.9% of women breastfed exclusively, 29.0% used formula and breast milk, and 29.1% bottle-fed only. Seven-hundred and twenty women (22.5%) made 824 comments related to feeding. Four themes were identified: (1) support and encouragement from healthcare professionals, (2) information and advice regarding feeding, (3) Pressure to feed in a particular way and (lack of) respect for personal preferences, and (4) hospital environment and resources.Key conclusions: Some women experienced a lack of support with feeding their babies, regardless of feeding method. Clear and concise information on feeding practices and home supports could help to support mothers with breast or formula feeding.Implications for practice: It is important that healthcare professionals provide evidence-based information and support, while respecting women's choices. Lactation consultants could offer training and consistent information to healthcare professionals as well as providing specialist support to mothers who experience problems with breastfeeding during their hospital stay and in the postnatal period.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

ID DISCOURSE ANALYSIS
AB "Computergestiitzte Analyse qualitativer Daten: Wie sich die qualitative Sozialforschung fur Massentextanalysen offnet". Two developments in computational text analysis may change the way qualitative data analysis in social sciences is performed: 1. the availability of digital text worth to investigate is growing rapidly, and 2. the improvement of algorithmic information extraction approaches, also called text mining, allows for further bridging the gap between qualitative and quantitative text analysis. The key factor hereby is the inclusion of context into computational linguistic models which extends conventional computational content analysis towards the extraction of meaning. To clarify methodological differences of various computer-assisted text analysis approaches the article suggests a typology from the perspective of a qualitative researcher. This typology shows compatibilities between manual qualitative data analysis methods and computational, rather quantitative approaches for large scale mixed method text analysis designs.

AB Purpose - This study develops a conceptual framework and a series of instruments for capturing researchers' data-sharing practices in the social sciences, by synergizing the theory of knowledge infrastructure and the theory of remote scientific collaboration.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper triangulates the results of three studies of data sharing across the social sciences, with 144 participants in total, and classifies the confusion, "frictions" and opportunities arising from such sharing into four overarching dimensions: data characteristics, technological infrastructure, research culture and individual drivers.
   Findings - Based on the sample, the findings suggest that the majority of faculty and students in social science research do not share their data because many of them are unaware of the benefits and methods of doing so. Additional findings regarding social scientists' data-sharing behaviors include: (1) those who do share qualitative data in data repositories are more likely to share their research tools than their raw data; and (2) perceived technical support and extrinsic motivation are both strong predictors of qualitative data sharing (a previously underresearched subtype of social science data sharing).
   Originality/value - The study confirms the previously hypothesized nature of "friction" in qualitative data sharing in the social sciences, arising chiefly from the time and labor intensiveness of ensuring data privacy.

AB The aim of this qualitative descriptive study, guided by Antonovsky's salutogenic model, was to explore the manifestations of strength within the interviews of Spanish-speaking Mexican-American women aging with mobility impairments who also experienced intimate partner violence (IPV). IPV events gleaned from 26 audiotaped interviews from 7 Spanish-speaking Mexican-American women, who ranged in age from 55 to 75 years, constituted the sample for this secondary analysis. Five categories were identified: abuse from early on that shaped sense of coherence; violencia tan cruel-threatened sense of coherence; "salutogenic" choices within the context of IPV; a quest for peace; and strength amid struggle.

AB Background: Sharing patient data can help drive scientific advances and improve patient care, but service users are concerned about how their data are used. When the National Health Service proposes to scrape general practitioner records, it is very important that we understand these concerns in some depth.
   Objective: This study aims to investigate views of mental health service users on acceptable data sharing to provide clear recommendations for future data sharing systems.
   Methods: A total of 4 focus groups with 4 member-checking groups were conducted via the internet between October 2020 and March 2021, with a total of 22 service users in the United Kingdom. Thematic analysis was used to identify the themes.
   Results: Six main themes, with several subthemes were identified, such as the purpose of data sharing-for profit, public good, and continuation of care; discrimination through the misattribution of physical symptoms to mental health conditions (ie, diagnostic overshadowing) alongside the discrimination of individuals or groups within society (ie, institutional discrimination); safeguarding data by preserving anonymity and confidentiality, strengthening security measures, and holding organizations accountable; data accuracy and informed consent-increasing transparency about data use and choice; and incorporating service user involvement in system governance to provide insight and increase security.
   Conclusions: This study extends the limited research on the views and concerns of mental health service users regarding acceptable data sharing. If adopted, the recommendations should improve the confidence of service users in sharing their data. The five recommendations include screening to ensure that data sharing benefits the public, providing service users with information about how their data are shared and what for, highlighting the existing safeguarding procedures, incorporating service user involvement, and developing tailored training for health care professionals to address issues of diagnostic overshadowing and inaccurate health records. Adopting such systems would aid in data sharing for legitimate interests that will benefit patients and the National Health Service.

AB This paper investigates the organizational challenges raised by Big Data and its impact on the business environment with a focus on performance management. We investigate managers' perceptions, understanding, and attitudes relating to Big Data and its analytics, in terms of opportunities, extent, limitations, challenges, and implications, with specific reference to performance management. The research methodology we adopt is grounded theory: we develop a reflection guide based on research questions covering the impact and challenges of a data-driven culture on business, and the impact on performance management and the decision-making process. The results obtained from senior executives from 21 Romanian companies leads to a conceptual model that distils the major areas arising from the responses and the interrelationships between them. These reveal several key areas of managerial relevance and suggest fruitful action. In particular, we find that the most critical areas requiring intervention lie in the area of awareness and understanding, goal setting, assessing benefits and limitations, learning to trust data, and commitment to an embedded data-driven culture. In addition to changes within organizations themselves, there are also implications for other stakeholders, such as education providers.

AB Purpose
   Big data has raised challenges and opportunities for business, the information technology (IT) industry and research communities. Nowadays, small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) are dealing with big data using their limited resources. The purpose of this paper is to describe the synergistic relationship between big data and knowledge management (KM), analyze the challenges and IT solutions of big data for SME and derives a KM model of big data for SME based on the collected real-world business cases.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The study collects eight well-documented cases of successful big data analytics in SME and conducts a qualitative data analysis of these cases in the context of KM. The qualitative data analysis of the multiple cases reveals a KM model of big data for SME.
   Findings
   The proposed model portrays the synergistic relationship between big data and KM. It indicates that strategic use of data, knowledge guided big data project planning, IT solutions for SME and new knowledge products are the major constructs of KM of big data for SME. These constructs form a loop through the causal relationships between them.
   Originality/value
   The study contributes to the KM literature by developing a theoretical model of KM of big data for SME based on underlying dimensions of strategic use of data, knowledge guided big data project planning, IT solutions for SME and new knowledge products.

   RESEARCH; SOUTH-AFRICA; PATIENT
AB In the context of South Africa, what we do know is that huge amount of healthcare data does exist and that they are consciously and unconsciously scattered in bits and pieces across facilities within the country. This has directly or indirectly resulted to underutilisation of data, which affects service delivery to the community. For example, many patients have been wrongly diagnosed, and some others have been given wrong medications due to duplication of prescriptions, which were influenced by lack of real-time information. Consequently, there have been loss and damages to lives, contributing to the mortality rate in the country. This study was undertaken on the premise of these challenges, to develop a conceptual framework that can guide how data could be managed towards improved services within the South African healthcare facilities. The interpretive approach was employed. Qualitative data were gathered from existing works. Structuration theory was applied as a lens to guide the analysis of the data. From the findings, a framework was developed, primarily to guide and advance the waysin which data are stored, retrieved, managed, and used for healthcare improved services.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to determine whether TAMS Analyzer and Viewshare are viable free and open source software data sharing and creation tools for those with limited funding and technological skills.
   Design/methodology/approach - The participant observer method was used to collect experiential evidence while applying the tools to a collection of text-, image-, and video-based digital cultural records.
   Findings - TAMS Analyzer was found to be a low barrier to entry tool for those with coding and qualitative data analysis experience. Those with general experience will be able to create datasets with the support of manuals and tutorials, while those with limited experience may find it difficult to use. Viewshare was found to be a low barrier to entry tool for sharing data online, and accessible for all skill levels.
   Research limitations/implications - TAMS Analyzer supports Mac and Linux platforms only, so a low-cost software recommendation was made for those in Windows environments.
   Practical implications - Librarians can use these tools to address data access gaps while promoting library digital collections.
   Social implications - With a greater understanding of data tools, librarians can be advisors, collaborators, agents for data culture, and relevant participants in digital humanities scholarship.
   Originality/value - The research evaluates both the capabilities of the tools and the barriers to using or accessing them, which are often neglected. The paper addresses a need in the literature for greater scrutiny of tools that are a critical component of the data ecology, and will further assist librarians when connecting scholars to tools of inquiry in an environment with limited funding and technical support.

AB Health information systems are an important planning and monitoring tool for public health services, but may lack information from the private health sector. In this fourth article in a series on district decision-making for health, we assessed the extent of maternal, newborn and child health (MNCH)-related data sharing between the private and public sectors in two districts of Uttar Pradesh, India; analysed barriers to data sharing; and identified key inputs required for data sharing. Between March 2013 and August 2014, we conducted 74 key informant interviews at national, state and district levels. Respondents were stakeholders from national, state and district health departments, professional associations, non-governmental programmes and private commercial health facilities with 3-200 beds. Qualitative data were analysed using a framework based on a priori and emerging themes. Private facilities registered for ultrasounds and abortions submitted standardized records on these services, which is compulsory under Indian laws. Data sharing for other services was weak, but most facilities maintained basic records related to institutional deliveries and newborns. Public health facilities in blocks collected these data from a few private facilities using different methods. The major barriers to data sharing included the public sector's non-standardized data collection and utilization systems for MNCH and lack of communication and follow up with private facilities. Private facilities feared information disclosure and the additional burden of reporting, but were willing to share data if asked officially, provided the process was simple and they were assured of confidentiality. Unregistered facilities, managed by providers without a biomedical qualification, also conducted institutional deliveries, but were outside any reporting loops. Our findings suggest that even without legislation, the public sector could set up an effective MNCH data sharing strategy with private registered facilities by developing a standardized and simple system with consistent communication and follow up.

ID EARLY WARNING SCORE; VITAL SIGNS; PATTERNS; CARE
AB Aim To explore the impact of using electronic data in performance management to improve nursing compliance with a protocol. Background Electronic data are increasingly used to monitor protocol compliance but little is known about the impact on nurses' practice in hospital wards. Method Seventeen acute hospital nursing staff participated in semi-structured interviews about compliance with an early warning score (EWS) protocol delivered by a bedside electronic handheld device. Results Before electronic EWS data was used to monitor compliance, staff combined protocol-led actions with clinical judgement. However, some observations were missed to reduce noise and disruption at night. After compliance monitoring was introduced, observations were sometimes covertly omitted using a loophole. Interviewees described a loss of autonomy but acknowledged the EWS system sometimes flagged unexpected patient deterioration. Conclusions Introducing automated electronic systems to support nursing tasks can decrease nursing burden but remove the ability to record legitimate reasons for missing observations. This can result in covert resistance that could reduce patient safety. Implications for nursing management Providing the ability to log legitimate reasons for missing observations would allow nurses to balance professional judgement with the use of electronic data in performance management of protocol compliance.

AB BackgroundPatients with heart failure have significant palliative care needs, but few are offered palliative care. Understanding the experiences of delivering and receiving palliative care from different perspectives can provide insight into the mechanisms of successful palliative care integration. There is limited research that explores multi-perspective and longitudinal experiences with palliative care provision. This study aimed to explore the longitudinal experiences of patients with heart failure, family carers, and health professionals with palliative care services.MethodsA secondary analysis of 20 qualitative three-month apart interviews with patients with heart failure and family carers recruited from three community palliative care services in the UK. In addition, four group interviews with health professionals from four different services were analysed. Data were analysed using 'reflexive thematic' analysis. Results were explored through the lens of Normalisation Process Theory.ResultsFour themes were generated: Impact of heart failure, Coping and support, Recognising palliative phase, and Coordination of care. The impact of heart failure on patients and families was evident in several dimensions: physical, psychological, social, and financial. Patients developed different coping strategies and received most support from their families. Although health professionals endeavoured to support the patients and families, this was sometimes lacking. Health professionals found it difficult to recognise the palliative phase and when to initiate palliative care conversations. In turn, patients and family carers asked for better communication, collaboration, and care coordination along the whole disease trajectory.ConclusionsThe study provided broad insight into the experiences of patients, family carers, and health professionals with palliative care. It showed the impact of heart failure on patients and their families, how they cope, and how they could be supported to address their palliative care needs. The study findings can help researchers and healthcare professionals to design palliative care interventions focusing on the perceived care needs of patients and families.

TI Search, reuse and sharing of research data in materials science and
   engineering-A qualitative interview study
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Open research data practices are a relatively new, thus still evolving part of scientific work, and their usage varies strongly within different scientific domains. In the literature, the investigation of open research data practices covers the whole range of big empirical studies covering multiple scientific domains to smaller, in depth studies analysing a single field of research. Despite the richness of literature on this topic, there is still a lack of knowledge on the (open) research data awareness and practices in materials science and engineering. While most current studies focus only on some aspects of open research data practices, we aim for a comprehensive understanding of all practices with respect to the considered scientific domain. Hence this study aims at 1) drawing the whole picture of search, reuse and sharing of research data 2) while focusing on materials science and engineering. The chosen approach allows to explore the connections between different aspects of open research data practices, e.g. between data sharing and data search. In depth interviews with 13 researchers in this field were conducted, transcribed verbatim, coded and analysed using content analysis. The main findings characterised research data in materials science and engineering as extremely diverse, often generated for a very specific research focus and needing a precise description of the data and the complete generation process for possible reuse. Results on research data search and reuse showed that the interviewees intended to reuse data but were mostly unfamiliar with (yet interested in) modern methods as dataset search engines, data journals or searching public repositories. Current research data sharing is not open, but bilaterally and usually encouraged by supervisors or employers. Project funding does affect data sharing in two ways: some researchers argue to share their data openly due to their funding agency's policy, while others face legal restrictions for sharing as their projects are partly funded by industry. The time needed for a precise description of the data and their generation process is named as biggest obstacle for data sharing. From these findings, a precise set of actions is derived suitable to support Open Data, involving training for researchers and introducing rewards for data sharing on the level of universities and funding bodies.

AB Open access has moved from the periphery to the mainstream in the last few years, and most recently there have been calls to make research data "accessible, useable and reusable". While there are many good arguments for this development, including that it makes the research process more transparent and enables others to re-use the data collected, it also has negative implications for social science research in certain contexts. The case addressed here is "elite" interviewing in the context of conducting research in Sweden. In this case there is already a strong legislative focus on openness with implications for research ethics. This suggests that open data access implementation, particularly in the context of specific legislative frameworks, needs to be reviewed to ascertain ethically correct interviewee and research subject protection in the social sciences.

AB Objective: To assess the willingness of older Swiss adults to share genetic data for research purposes and to investigate factors that might impact their willingness to share data. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted among 40 participants (19 male and 21 female) aged between 67 and 92 years, between December 2013 and April 2014 attending the Seniorenuniversitat Zurich, Switzerland. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and anonymized. For the analysis of the interviews, an initial coding scheme was developed, refined over time, and applied afterwards to all interviews. Results: The majority of participants were in favor of placing genetic data to research's disposal. Participant's motivations to share data were mainly driven by altruistic reasons and by contributing to the greater good. Furthermore, several factors which might impact the willingness to share data such as sharing data with private companies, generational differences, differences between sharing genetic data or health data, and sharing due to financial incentives were highlighted. Last, some participants indicated concerns regarding data sharing such as misuse of data, the fear of becoming a transparent citizen, and data safety. However, 20% of the participants express confidence in data protection. Even participants who were skeptical in the beginning of the interviews admitted the benefits of data sharing. Discussion: Overall, this study suggests older citizens are willing to share their data for research purposes. However, most of them will only contribute if their data is appropriately protected and if they trust the research institution to use the shared data responsibly. More transparency and detailed information regarding the data usage are urgently needed. There is a great need to increase the engagement of older adults in research since they present a large segment of our society-one which is often underexamined in research. Conclusion: Increased focus on general public engagement, especially of older adults, in scientific research activities known as "citizen science" is needed to further strengthen the uptake of personalized medicine.

AB Objective: To understand and explore data sharing practices among adolescents and their parents using a closed-loop system.
   Methods: Eighteen adolescents (aged 11-18 years) and 19 parents were interviewed after adolescents had similar to 6 months experience of using a closed-loop system, which permitted them to share glucose and insulin data with parents/caregivers. Data were analyzed thematically.
   Results: There was considerable variability in how parent-child dyads perceived, valued, and undertook data sharing. Parents of early adolescents (11-13 years) reported making extensive use of "real time" data to remotely manage their child's diabetes and early adolescents described needing and wanting this input. Parents of middle adolescents (14-16 years) described making greater use of retrospective data. To avoid conflict and encourage and support their son/daughter's autonomy, these individuals reported practicing watchful waiting and only intervening after concerns about a pattern of problematic behavior or their child's safety arose. Middle adolescents indicated that data sharing had been done primarily for the benefit of their parents, although they also noted quality of life benefits for themselves. Among late adolescents (17+ years), parents were simply remote because their son/daughter had not permitted access to their data. Participants recommended clear ground rules be put in place about when, and how, data sharing should be used.
   Conclusions: To help parent-child dyads use data sharing in ways which minimize conflict and optimize constructive parental support, we recommend tailored input and support, which takes account of family dynamics, the young person's developmental maturity, and the different ways in which data are used across the adolescent age range.

AB Childcare attendance is a recognized independent risk factor for pediatric infectious diseases due to the pathogen-sharing behaviors of young children and the crowded environments of childcare programs. The Michigan Child Care Related Infections Surveillance Program (MCRISP) is a novel online illness surveillance network used by community childcare centers to track disease incidence. It has been used to warn local public health departments about emerging outbreaks. The flow of data from MCRISP, however, remains largely unidirectional-from data reporter to public health researchers. With the intent to ultimately improve the system for users, we wanted to better understand how community illness data collected by MCRISP might best benefit childcare stakeholders themselves. Using a ground-up design approach, we conducted a series of focus groups among childcare directors participating in MCRISP. All primary data reporters from each of the 30 MCRISP-affiliated childcare centers were eligible to participate in the focus groups. A thematic assessment from the focus groups revealed that participants wanted surveillance system improvements that would (1) support subjective experiences with objective data, (2) assist with program decision making, (3) provide educational resources, and (4) prioritize the user's experience. Our findings support a framework by which community disease surveillance networks can move toward greater transparency and 2-way data flow. Ultimately, a more mutually beneficial surveillance system improves stakeholder engagement, provides opportunities for rapid mitigation strategies, and can help allocate timely resources in responding to emerging outbreaks and pandemics.

AB Interprofessional education and international service learning (ISL) experiences are increasing in healthcare education and have the potential to broaden healthcare providers' strategies to manage patients' pain. After the addition of a physical therapy (PT) cohort to an existing interprofessional ISL, survey data was collected for program evaluation. Responses indicated altered ideation regarding the role of PT in pain management, and this theme was investigated further. Following two one-week interprofessional ISL experiences in Honduras in 2015 (Y1) and 2016 (Y2), participating students and preceptors in pharmacy, physician assistant and osteopathic medicine and Y1 PT preceptors were surveyed regarding their impressions of the PT cohort and the PT profession in general. Researchers performed thematic analysis to identify trends in responses, yielding three themes regarding PT's role in pain management: Patient Empowerment (46.2%), Management of Musculoskeletal Pain (42.3%), and Alternatives to Pharmacological Pain Management (11.5%). Results suggest that participating in an interprofessional ISL experience with a PT cohort encourages consideration of non-pharmacological methods to treat pain, including referral to PT to address musculoskeletal pain, and empowering patients to prevent or self-manage pain. These findings may be especially significant for under-resourced communities.

AB While biobanks have become more prevalent, little is known about adolescents' views of key governance issues. We conducted semi-structured interviews with adolescents between 15 and 17 years old to solicit their views. All interviews were audiotaped and transcribed. Two investigators coded the transcripts and resolved any discrepancies through consensus. We conducted 18 interviews before reaching data saturation. Four participants (22%) had previously heard of a biobank. Many participants had misunderstandings about biobanks, some of which persisted after education. Participants believed that enrolling in a biobank would benefit others through scientific research. Many study participants were unable to identify risks of biobank participation. Thirteen participants (72%) were willing to enrolling in a biobank and only one (6%) initially was not. Participants believed that if they were unable to provide assent when enrolled, then they should be re-contacted at the age of majority and their data should not be shared until that time. Participants emphasized the importance of being aware of their enrollment and the possibility of disagreeing with their parents. Participants' misunderstanding of biobanks suggests that assent may not be adequately informed without additional education. While adolescents had positive attitudes toward biobanks, they emphasized the importance of awareness of and involvement in the decision to enroll.

   economizing theory applied to the human genome project databases
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Ironically, although much work has been done on elucidating algorithms for enabling scientists to efficiently retrieve relevant information from the glut of data derived from the efforts of the Human Genome Project and other similar projects, little has been performed on optimizing the levels of data economy across databases. One technique to qualify the degree of data economization is that constructed by Boisot. Boisot's Information Space (I-Space) takes into account the degree to which data are written (codification), the degree to which the data can be understood (abstraction), and the degree to which the data are effectively communicated to an audience (diffusion). A data system is said to be more data economical if it is relatively high in these dimensions. Application of the approach to entries in two popular, publicly available biological data repositories, the Protein DataBank (PDB) and GenBank, leads to the recommendation that PDB increases its level of abstraction through establishing a larger set of detailed keywords, diffusion through constructing hyperlinks to other databases, and codification through constructing additional subsections. With these recommendations in place, PDB would achieve the greater data economies currently enjoyed by GenBank. A discussion of the limitations of the approach is presented.

ID PUBLIC-ATTITUDES
AB Research utilising de-identified patient health information extracted from electronic medical records (EMRs) from general practices has steadily grown in recent years in response to calls to increase use of health data for research and other secondary purposes in Australia. Little is known about the views of key primary care personnel on this issue, which are important, as they may influence whether practices agree to provide EMR data for research. This exploratory qualitative study investigated the attitudes and beliefs of general practitioners (GPs), practice managers (PMs) and practice nurses (PNs) around sharing de-identified EMR patient health information with researchers. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 11 participants (6 GPs, 3 PMs and 2 PNs) recruited via purposive sampling from general practices in Victoria, Australia. Transcripts were coded and thematically analysed. Participants were generally enthusiastic about research utilising de-identified health information extracted from EMRs for altruistic reasons, including: positive effects on primary care research, clinical practice and population health outcomes. Concerns raised included patient privacy and data breaches, third-party use of extracted data and patient consent. These findings can provide guidance to researchers and policymakers in designing and implementing projects involving de-identified health information extracted from EMRs.

AB Background High-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) cause all cervical cancer and the majority of vulvar, vaginal, anal, penile and oropharyngeal cancers. Although HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection, public awareness of this is poor. In addition, many clinicians lack adequate knowledge or confidence to discuss sexual transmission and related sensitive issues. Complex science needs to be communicated in a clear, digestible, honest and salient way. Therefore, the aim of this study was to coproduce with patients who have cancer appropriate resources to guide these highly sensitive and difficult consultations.
   Methods A matrix of evidence developed from a variety of sources, including a systematic review and telephone interviews with clinicians, supported the production of a draft list of approximately 100 potential educational messages. These were refined in face-to-face patient interviews using card-sorting techniques, and tested in cognitive debrief interviews to produce a (a) over cap (sic) fast and frugal (a) over cap (sic)(TM) knowledge tool.
   Results We developed three versions of a consultation guide, each comprising a clinician guidance sheet and patient information leaflet for gynaecological (cervical, vaginal, vulvar), anal or oropharyngeal cancers. That cancer could be caused by a sexually transmitted virus acquired many years previously was surprising to many and shocking to a few patients. However, they found the information clear, helpful and reassuring. Clinicians acknowledged a lack of confidence in explaining HPV, welcomed the clinician guidance sheets and considered printed information for patients particularly useful.
   Conclusion Because of the (a) over cap (sic) shock factor (a) over cap (sic)(TM), clinicians will need to approach the discussion of HPV with sensitivity and take individual needs and preferences into account, but we provide a novel, rigorously developed and tested resource which should have broad applicability in the UK National Health Service and other health systems.

ID PUBLIC RELEASE; ISSUES
AB Objective. To assess the information needs and responses of managed care plans to the Medicare Managed Care Consumer Assessment of Health Plans Study (MMC-CAHPS (R)).
   Data Sources/Study Setting. One hundred sixty-five representatives of Medicare managed care plans participated in focus groups or interviews in the spring of 1998, 1999, and 2000.
   Study Design. In 1998 focus groups were conducted with representatives of managed care plans to develop and test a print report of MMC-CAMPS results. After the reports were disseminated focus groups and interviews were conducted in 1999 and 2000 to identify perceptions, uses, and potential enhancements of the report.
   Data Collection/Extraction Methods. The study team conducted a total of 23 focus groups and 12 telephone interviews and analyzed the transcripts to identify major themes.
   Principal Findings. In 1998 participants identified the report content and format that best enabled them to assess their performance relative to other Medicare managed care plans. In 1999 and 2000 participants described their responses to and uses of the report. They reported comparing the MMC-CAHPS results to internal surveys and presenting the results to senior managers, market analysts, and quality-improvement teams. They also indicated that the report's usefulness would be enhanced if it were received within six months of survey completion and if additional data analysis was presented.
   Conclusions. Focus soup results suggest that the MMC-CAHPS report enhances awareness and knowledge of the comparative performance of Medicare managed care plans. However, participants reported needing additional analysis of survey results to target quality-improvement activities on the populations with the most reported problems.

ID DECISION-MAKING PROCESS; FAMILY CAREGIVERS; EXPERIENCES; TRANSITION
AB Background: Nursing home placement of people with dementia can become necessary when informal care is no longer sufficient. Informal carers experience the transition period as an additional burden.
   Aim: Experiences and views of informal carers and healthcare professionals regarding the transition from people with dementia to a nursing home are investigated to improve the support for informal carers.
   Method: This secondary analysis included data from all five focus groups with n = 30 informal carers and healthcare professionals conducted as part of the "RightTimePlaceCare" project. To supplement the material which resulted from a single interview question, a literature analysis with the same focus was conducted.
   Results: The merged results indicated that informal carers needed professional support early on at home until after the nursing home placement. Concerns regarding nursing homes, financial aspects and family related issues were important aspects in the decision making. Healthcare professionals recommended provision of early guidance regarding those matters and making own experiences with nursing homes. Healthcare professionals should serve as mediators during the transition process and improve the collaboration between service providers.
   Conclusions: Empowering families to make informed choices could be facilitated by offering advice at home about their options for formal support services, financial support, and housing solutions. Healthcare professionals should support caregivers to make a decision, coordinate the placement and to cope with the new situation.

ID IMPACT
AB Purpose - In this study, Nonaka and Takeuchi's socialization, externalization, combination and internalization (SECI) model of knowledge creation is used to gain insight into the process of knowledge creation in data teams. These teams are composed of school leaders and teachers, who work together to improve the quality of education. They collaboratively create knowledge related to data use and to an educational problem they are studying. The paper aims to discuss these issues.
   Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative micro-process case study was conducted for two data teams. The modes, transitions and content of the knowledge creation process were analyzed for all data team meetings over a two-year period. In addition, all team members were interviewed twice to triangulate the findings.
   Findings - Results show that the knowledge creation process was cyclical across meetings, but more iterative within meetings. Furthermore, engagement in the socialization and internalization mode provided added value in this process. Finally, the SECI model clearly differentiated between team members' processes. Team members who engaged more often in the socialization and internalization modes and displayed more personal engagement in those modes gained greater and deeper knowledge.
   Research limitations/implications - The SECI model is valuable for understanding how teams gain new knowledge and why they differ in those gains.
   Practical implications - Stimulation of active personal engagement in the socialization and internalization mode is needed.
   Originality/value - This is one of the first attempts to concretely observe the process of knowledge creation. It provides essential insights into what educators do in professional development contexts, and how support can best be provided.

AB As people deal with cardiovascular disease (CVD), they are to self-monitor routinely and be aware of complications and the corresponding course of action. Engaging in these self-care behaviors is conducive to gaining knowledge of health status. Even so, knowledge of the self may be insufficient in making sense of chronic conditions. In constructing a new normal after health-related life disruptions, people often turn to peers (others facing similar health issues) and share personal health information with each other. Although health information-sharing behavior is well-documented, it remains underexplored what attitudes individuals with chronic conditions, such as CVD, have toward disclosing personal health data to peers and exploring those of others with similar conditions. We surveyed 39 people who reported being diagnosed with CVD to understand how they conceptualize sharing personal health data with their peers. By analyzing qualitative survey data thematically, we found that respondents expressed themselves as uncertain about the benefits of interacting with peers in such a manner. At the same time, they recognized an opportunity to learn new ideas to enhance CVD self-care in mutual data sharing. We also report participants' analytical orientation toward this sort of data sharing herein and elaborate on what sharing a range of personal health data could mean. In light of the existing literature, this study unpacks the notion of sharing in a different population/pathology and with more nuance, particularly by distinguishing between disclosing one's data and exploring others'.

AB Background We aimed to examine the ethical concerns Singaporeans have about sharing health-data for precision medicine (PM) and identify suggestions for governance strategies. Just as Asian genomes are under-represented in PM, the views of Asian populations about the risks and benefits of data sharing are under-represented in prior attitudinal research. Methods We conducted seven focus groups with 62 participants in Singapore from May to July 2019. They were conducted in three languages (English, Mandarin and Malay) and analysed with qualitative content and thematic analysis. Results Four key themes emerged: nuanced understandings of data security and data sensitivity; trade-offs between data protection and research benefits; trust (and distrust) in the public and private sectors; and governance and control options. Participants were aware of the inherent risks associated with data sharing for research. Participants expressed conditional support for data sharing, including genomic sequence data and information contained within electronic medical records. This support included sharing data with researchers from universities and healthcare institutions, both in Singapore and overseas. Support was conditional on the perceived social value of the research and appropriate de-identification and data security processes. Participants suggested that a data sharing oversight body would help strengthen public trust and comfort in data research for PM in Singapore. Conclusion Maintenance of public trust in data security systems and governance regimes can enhance participation in PM and data sharing for research. Contrary to themes in much prior research, participants demonstrated a sophisticated understanding of the inherent risks of data sharing, analysed trade-offs between risks and potential benefits of PM, and often adopted an international perspective.

AB Background: Theoretical integration is a necessary element of study design if clarification of experiential learning is to be achieved. There are few published examples demonstrating how this can be achieved.
   Aims: This methodological article provides a worked example of research methodology that achieved clarification of authentic early experiences (AEEs) through a bi-directional approach to theory and data.
   Methods: Bi-directional refers to our simultaneous use of theory to guide and interrogate empirical data and the use of empirical data to refine theory. We explain the five steps of our methodological approach: (1) understanding the context; (2) critique on existing applications of socio-cultural models to inform study design; (3) data generation; (4) analysis and interpretation and (5) theoretical development through a novel application of Metis.
   Results: These steps resulted in understanding of how and why different outcomes arose from students participating in AEE. Our approach offers a mechanism for clarification without which evidence-based effective ways to maximise constructive learning cannot be developed. In our example it also contributed to greater theoretical understanding of the influence of social interactions.
   Conclusion: By sharing this example of research undertaken to develop both theory and educational practice we hope to assist others seeking to conduct similar research.

AB Efforts to internalize data sharing in research practice have been driven largely by developing international norms that have not incorporated opinions from researchers in low- and middle-income countries. We sought to identify the issues around ethical data sharing in the context of research involving women and children in urban India. We interviewed researchers, managers, and research participants associated with a Mumbai non-governmental organization, as well as researchers from other organizations and members of ethics committees. We conducted 22 individual semi-structured interviews and involved 44 research participants in focus group discussions. We used framework analysis to examine ideas about data and data sharing in general; its potential benefits or harms, barriers, obligations, and governance; and the requirements for consent. Both researchers and participants were generally in favor of data sharing, although limited experience amplified their reservations. We identified three themes: concerns that the work of data producers may not receive appropriate acknowledgment, skepticism about the process of sharing, and the fact that the terrain of data sharing was essentially uncharted and confusing. To increase data sharing in India, we need to provide guidelines, protocols, and examples of good practice in terms of consent, data preparation, screening of applications, and what individuals and organizations can expect in terms of validation, acknowledgment, and authorship.

AB The article discusses the effects on the researcher of reading disturbing secondary data (defined here as evidence gathered by someone other than the researcher). The case study is a qualitative sociological autopsy of suicide, and the secondary data -written documents and photographs -are all from case files in a British coroner's office. Following ethnographic detail about the research setting and research process, there is discussion of the diverse secondary data sources in these files, particularly in relation to the impact on the researcher. Some general observations are made about emotion in the research process and potential strategies for responding to emotion. The authors locate their responses to reading about suicides within the broader context of the social processing of death and distress, and also consider whether emotional reactions to data have any analytical purchase.

AB This paper presents a critique of the polarization thesis as it is popularly conceived in Britain. The apparent phenomenon of an increasing divergence of the population into extremes of multi-earner and no-earner households is typically demonstrated using secondary data sources. Consequently, polarization is explained in terms of household employment with regard to earners in a way which overlooks sources of division which emanate from within a variety of household structures. It is posited that the appearance of a polarization of household prospects is manifested, at least in part, by the conflation of social and demographic regional profiles, which combines the observation of two discrete causal mechanisms into one. To illustrate this point, data is presented h-om the 1991 Census of Population Sample of Anonymized Records (SARs) which identifies a pattern of disaggregated household employment compositions (by gender and hours worked) for a specific population of 'nuclear family' households. It is suggested that once the regional effects of flexible employment practices and sectoral restructuring are viewed through the lens of detailed household gender divisions of labour, beyond a one-earner versus multi-earner division, to focus on who is earning, how securely and with what effect on household practices, then questions can be asked about the social implications of global economic restructuring.

AB Purpose The present research is aimed at presenting a framework for the reuse of research data in Iran through applying the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). Design/methodology/approach The research at hand has a mixed methods design. In the qualitative section, the authors first carried out meta-synthesis and then an interview was conducted. Likewise, in the quantitative section, the reliability of the recommended framework was measured through carrying out a survey. Finally, the framework for data reuse was presented in five dimensions, namely human, organizational, policies and laws, technical, implementation and analysis. Findings Through structural equation modeling, the fitness of the framework was confirmed, and it was found out that the dimensions of policies, human and organizational played more prominent roles in the explanation of the framework in comparison with the other two dimensions. Originality/value Research studies in the area of data reuse have been conducted either quantitatively or qualitatively and in most of them interviews or questionnaires were used as tools for collecting data; however, due to the nature of this area and its relatively new literature in Iran, it is necessary to use mixed methods in order to be able to arrive at a proper understanding of this concept using both quantitative and qualitative approaches.

AB The Thailand Major Overseas Programme coordinates large multi-center studies in tropical medicine and generates vast amounts of data. As the data sharing movement gains momentum, we wanted to understand attitudes and experiences of relevant stakeholders about what constitutes good data sharing practice. We conducted 15 interviews and three focus groups discussions involving 25 participants and found that they generally saw data sharing as something positive. Data sharing was viewed as a means to contribute to scientific progress and lead to better quality analysis, better use of resources, greater accountability, and more outputs. However, there were also important reservations including potential harms to research participants, their communities, and the researchers themselves. Given these concerns, several areas for discussion were identified: data standardization, appropriate consent models, and governance.

AB This article discusses the topic of sharing the results of anthropological studies, such as disseminating research results to health professionals and to social movements. The starting point is a dialog with a number of successful and less successful publicizing experiences. This has allowed us to find negotiations and limits of this practice, and the different dimensions of which it is a part. We will use examples to develop two lines of questioning regarding "post-study requirements". The first has to do with the ethical and political nature of the initiative, and the second problematizes the "interest" in the results on the part of the various subjects involved in the anthropologic investigation.

ID CANCER-THERAPY; PARTICIPATION; INFORMATION; ATTITUDES; PATIENT
AB BACKGROUND. Informed consent has been proposed as the optimal method for ensuring the ethical entry of patients into clinical trials. However, it is known that problems with informed consent exist from the perspective of both patients and physicians. This has led to the suggestion that a third party, such as a research nurse or data manager, should be responsible for obtaining informed consent. The objective of this study was to explore the views of data managers concerning the nature, challenges, and rewards of their role and the similarities and differences between their role and that of physicians in obtaining informed consent.
   METHODS. Four focus groups in three large teaching hospitals were conducted. Twenty-one data managers who were involved in cancer or pain clinical trials participated. The focus groups were audiotaped, transcribed, and subjected to content analysis to identify themes.
   RESULTS. Data managers identified three primary roles complementary to that of physicians: information provision, quality assurance of the informed consent process, and ongoing support during the trial. Despite expressed concern that medical and drug company interests may lead to subtle coercion of the patient, participants did not support the notion that they may be solely responsible for the consent process. Participants described a range of ethical dilemmas they confronted, including patients asking them for medical details they could not provide and situations in which they felt that informed consent was compromised in some way, for example, dealing with situations in which the patient appeared to be entering the trial for the wrong reasons due to misunderstanding, need, or passivity. Effective functioning of the multidisciplinary team assisted data managers in performing their role. A range of training needs were identified, particularly communication skills training and trial start-up briefing.
   CONCLUSIONS. The issues raised by these data managers have important implications for the successful conduct of clinical trials, particularly the need for an integrated, multidisciplinary approach at all levels of the informed-consent process. (C) 2002 American Cancer Society.

AB The business analytics and strategic management literatures suggest that organizations should seek to exploit data as a key mechanism for competitive advantage. However, the rules of engagement are evolving, the regulatory landscape is becoming increasingly complex, and ex-amples of poor outcomes are increasingly common. The board - in its role of setting and moni-toring risk appetite - needs to be able to govern the risk/reward trade-off of the data asset. Contemporary data governance approaches are inadequate: they are overly rigid and risk ori-ented, limited in scope to an organization's self-interest rather than considering the broad set of stakeholders, and do not provide a platform for the board to manage this critical risk. This paper uses a unique set of informants - 41 board directors - to demonstrate that differences in board perspectives influence how organizations explore the secondary use of data. Furthermore, this paper identifies a set of relevant individual, organizational and environmental factors and pre-sents empirically based configurations of these factors that lead organizations to consider (or neglect) the secondary use of data as a critical enabler of competitive advantage.

AB Background The study investigated the research data management (RDM) practices of biomedical researchers at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) representing various biomedical disciplines. Objectives This study aimed to analyse the state of biomedical researchers' RDM practices based on RDM practice levels (individual, laboratory, institution and external). The findings of the study are expected to provide directions to information professionals for effective RDM services. Methods Semi-structured interviews with 11 researchers were conducted. The interviews were analysed by levels of RDM practices. Results The findings revealed that biomedical researchers focus on storing and sharing data and that RDM is performed mainly at the individual level. There seems to be a lack of laboratory level RDM system that allows consistent RDM practices among researchers. External RDM practice is often challenged by not having one responsible for RDM. Discussion Findings suggested a need for an agreed RDM system and customized support, particularly at the laboratory level. Also, institutional support can help researchers prepare for long term data preservation. Conclusion Our suggestions emphasize the importance of RDM training and support for long term data preservation, especially at the laboratory level.

AB Purpose This study aimed to present a model for open-data management for developing innovative information flow in Iranian knowledge-based companies (businesses). Design/methodology/approach The method was mixed (qualitative-quantitative) and data collection tools were interview and questionnaire. The qualitative part was done to identify the influential components in open data management (ecosystem) using the grounded theory method. A questionnaire was developed based on the results of the qualitative section and the theoretical foundations, and the quantitative section was conducted by analytical survey method and the model was extracted using factor analysis and the integration of the qualitative section. Findings Seven categories of entrepreneurial incentives, sustainable value, innovative features, challenges and barriers, actors, business model and requirements are the main categories that should be considered in open data management (ecosystem) with all categories of research have a significant relationship with open data management. Originality/value The study focused on open data management from an innovation paradigm perspective and its role in developing innovative information flow. The study aimed to identify the key components of the open data ecosystem, open-data value creation, and the need to use the "open data" approach to develop data-driven and knowledge-based businesses in Iran-an emerging approach largely ignored.

AB Context: Families are known to be involved in assisted dying and their involvement can be influenced by many factors. Objectives: To explore how Swiss families interact with health care professionals and right-to-die associations regarding assisted suicide and their choices around disclosure. Methods: A secondary data analysis on a cross-sectional qualitative interview study conducted in the Italian- and French-speaking parts of Switzerland was conducted. Interviews with 28 bereaved family members were analyzed using framework analysis. Results: Two main themes were identified: (1) Interactions with physicians and right-to-die associations. (2) Choices about disclosing their experiences. In general, families believed that assisted suicide is a private matter, to be pursued mainly outside the medical field and involved physicians only when necessary. Families appeared to deliberately limit interaction with physicians and to be more comfortable interacting with the right-to-die associations. Some participants presumed a clear choice between assisted suicide or palliative care. Disclosing to others the decision, and preparation of assisted suicide emerged to be an important emotional burden for families. Some family members preferred to restrict disclosure before and after assisted suicide, by sometimes not informing other family members until the final days. Conclusions: In Switzerland, there is limited interaction between families and health care professionals concerning assisted suicide decisions, whereas families reported more open interactions with right-to-die associations. It is recommended that the needs of families should be reflected in health policies, taking into consideration the different contexts where assisted dying is permitted.

TI Effects of the Covid-19 Pandemic on Online Use of Video Consultation by
   General Practitioners in Germany - a Secondary Data Analysis of German
   Health Insurance Data
SO GESUNDHEITSWESEN
LA German
DT Article
DE Covid-19; teleconsultation; telemedicine; general practitioner
AB Background In order to manage the Covid-19 pandemic in Germany in March 2020, the government implemented non-pharmaceutical interventions including school closures, case-based measures, social distancing, and a ban of all public events. Under these circumstances, professional societies and associations in the healthcare sector recommended the use of video consultations. The objective of this analysis was to generate statistically relevant insights into the use of video consultations before and during the Covid-19 pandemic
   Methods This study is based on the analysis of a comprehensive claims data set comprising anonymized data of 5.6 million beneficiaries of a large German health insurance fund. The dataset encompassed healthcare claims from 1 January 2019 to 30 June 2020 covering 29,464,913 patient contacts. The claims were divided into video consultations and face-to-face consultations. This paper presents descriptive statistics and analyses associations between variables.
   Results In 8,077 out of all contacts, a video consultation had taken place. This translates into 3.12 of 10,000 contacts. There was no significant difference in the utilization of video consultations by gender. However, the age differed significantly (Chi-square:2280.01, Sig: 0.000) between the contacts with or without use of video consultation. There is a significant increase of up to 27 times the use of video consultation in the first lockdown compared to the same month in 2019.
   Conclusions Apparent higher usage of telemedicine by patients in the age group 50 to 64 years and the very low usage in the group of 65 to 74 years shows that the use of video consultation is age sensitive and should be subject to goal-oriented implementation of telemedical offers. The observed increase, however, is small relative to the total number of patient contacts and is not significant. Thus, there is no evidence in this large dataset to support the claim that video consultation had risen dramatically through the Covid-19 pandemic. Qualitative research to determine the factors for patients and general practitioners that lead to or hinder the use of video consultation should help in addressing the slow digitalization in the outpatient sector in Germany.

AB Dementia is emerging from the shadows of societal exclusion and stigma. The engagement within society for people who are marginalised is co-constructed through the everyday practices that take place between them and those around them. However, this is inherently political, positioning people as active and activist in the relationship of their lives with their communities. The research aimed to interrogate an existing qualitative dataset in partnership with people living with dementia to inform the development of a way of working with people with dementia that is empowering. In this qualitative secondary data analysis project, we (1) analysed data through two theoretical lenses: Douglas' cultural theory of risk and Tronto's Ethic of Care, and (2) co-analysed the data together with people living with dementia during 16 workshops. The design involved cycles of presenting, interpreting, representing and reinterpreting the data and findings between multiple stakeholders. We identified a granular understanding of the way relationships change for people with dementia and how subtle factors and nuanced behaviour contribute to social exclusion, or support social inclusion. The results support relational care through the co-operative endeavour (of co-operative communication, co-operative action and co-operative care) in promoting the inclusion of people living with dementia.

AB Advancements in data technology provide easy access to open data sets that can act as raw material to promote data competencies in the education domain. In this study, we investigate how open data can be used to develop digital and data literacy skills among secondary school students (ages 11-15). Using qualitative and quantitative research methods, we identify how data collection and analysis can be integrated into school education using openly available data sets. We also test the usability of a platform for secondary schools that allows teachers to identify and use open data sets when teaching school subjects such as math, science, and geography. The results suggest that open data have the potential to advance the digital and data skills essential for future generations, as well as enable them to understand their surroundings by using real data sets as part of their subjects. The results also demonstrate that the Open Data Interface helps educators utilize open educational data sets in schools.

ID QUALITATIVE DATA; OLDER-PEOPLE; EXPERIENCES; AGENDA
AB Aims and objectivesAs individuals in Western societies age, there is increasing demand for home-based care to help older people stay in their homes for as long as possible and provide services that ensure a person's quality of life in old age. Numerous attempts are made to develop a framework to secure quality of care. However, research has shown insufficient quality in care for older people. In this study, the purpose is to study how older people's experiences with home care reflect a person-centred approach to care. Data derived from an earlier study on ageing among home-dwelling men and women who are aged 67-91 and living in the Faroe Islands.
   BackgroundPerson-centredness as a concept is an often quoted, but ill-defined concept. Most studies concerning person-centred care are conducted within hospital wards or long-term care institutions. Empirical studies concerning home-dwelling older people receiving home care are scarce.
   MethodsThe study is a secondary analysis of data from an earlier qualitative study. Latent thematic analysis was used which meant coding issues of potential interest and collecting these codes into themes.
   ResultsThree themes appeared to combine the initial codes: sense of involvement, sense of meaningfulness and contextual conditions. Overall, the analysis showed that the users were seldom involved in planning or scheduling the care they received. What they were offered did not always make sense to them or correspond to their needs or preferences.
   ConclusionsThe number of interviews included was limited. However, findings from this study point at some possible barriers to successful implementation of person-centredness within elder care. Especially, contextual conditions seem to limit the facilitation of person-centred practices.
   Relevance to clinical practiceHealthcare providers must take the user's preferences, resources and networks into consideration when coordinating and planning home care and, importantly, be open for negotiating needs. It is important to draw attention to the contrast between political intentions regarding elder care and the limited options for putting the intentions into practice.

ID EMPOWERMENT; CONTEXT
AB Grounded theory is well utilised in qualitative research for building theoretical understanding of complex social processes. Grounded theory data analysis strategies can be used with different types of data, including secondary data. Despite the potential advantages of secondary data, it is rarely used for grounded theory studies, largely due to a perception that researchers are unable to follow the guidelines of this research design with data that they themselves have not collected. This paper demonstrates the use of secondary data in a study investigating the substantive area of Indigenous empowerment. Potential pitfalls and advantages of using grounded theory methods to analyse secondary data are discussed, as well as factors that facilitated the analytic process in this study. These factors included having a large data set across multiple sites and the use of literature as a source of data. The findings provide a valuable model for combining research and practise.

AB A systematic literature review of researchers and healthcare professionals' attitudes towards the secondary use and sharing of health administrative and clinical trial data was conducted using electronic data searching. Eligible articles included those reporting qualitative or quantitative original research and published in English. No restrictions were placed on publication dates, study design, or disease setting. Two authors were involved in all stages of the review process; conflicts were resolved by consensus. Data was extracted independently using a pre-piloted data extraction template. Quality and bias were assessed using the QualSyst criteria for qualitative studies. Eighteen eligible articles were identified, and articles were categorised into four key themes: barriers, facilitators, access, and ownership; 14 subthemes were identified. While respondents were generally supportive of data sharing, concerns were expressed about access to data, data storage infrastructure, and consent. Perceptions of data ownership and acknowledgement, trust, and policy frameworks influenced sharing practice, as did age, discipline, professional focus, and world region. Young researchers were less willing to share data; they were willing to share in circumstances where they were acknowledged. While there is a general consensus that increased data sharing in health is beneficial to the wider scientific community, substantial barriers remain.

AB Background: Increasingly, patients with limited English proficiency are accessing home health care services in the United States. Few studies have examined how language barriers influence provider role implementation or workload in the home health care setting.
   Objectives: To explore home health care professionals' perspectives about how workload changes from managing language barriers influence quality and safety in home health care.
   Design: A qualitative secondary data analysis using a summative content analysis approach was used to analyze existing semi-structured interview data.
   Setting: A large urban home health care agency located on the East Coast of the United States.
   Participants: Thirty five home health care providers [31 registered nurses, 3 physical therapists, 1 occupational therapist].
   Results: A total of 142 discrete incidents emerged from the analysis. Overall, home health care providers experienced distinct shifts in how they implemented their roles that added to their workload and time spent with Limited English Proficiency patients and family members. Providers were concerned about interpretation accuracy and perceived it as potentially posing risks to patient safety. Changes in work patterns, therefore, sought to maximize patient safety.
   Conclusions: Home health care providers decision-making about how they adapt practice when faced with a language barrier is a sequence of actions based on awareness of the patient's language preference and if they spoke another language. Subsequent choices showed proactive behaviors to manage increased workload shaped by their perceived risk of the threats posed by the quality of interpreter services. Future research should develop quantitative models examining differences in workload when caring for limited English proficiency versus English speaking patients as well as the relationship between visit length and patient outcomes to determine optimal quality models.

AB The present study illustrates the use of a qualitative research technique, textual data analysis, in assessing the emotional content of open-ended survey responses. The Dictionary of Affect in Language (DAL), one of many acceptable routes to the measurement of emotion, provided the basis for scoring open-ended responses collected in a study of the organizational transformation efforts of a Fortune 100 firm based in the midwestern United States. Managers and corporate executives were surveyed with an in-depth questionnaire that included quantitative measures of several work-related perceptions and attitudes as well as open-ended questions regarding two major events that occurred during the transformation. Dimension scores produced from the DAL and direct ratings of open-ended responses correlated with the quantitative measures in expected and consistent ways. The use of textual data analytic approaches is discussed, and advantages and disadvantages of such approaches are broadly addressed.

TI ?I know I didn?t ask for it, but I?ve got it and I?ve let my kids down?:

AB Purpose: This article is a secondary data analysis which explores maternal unmet needs and their perception of the 'unmet needs' of adolescent children when they experienced maternal cancer. The analysis is underpinned by the theoretical framework of the Offspring Cancer Needs Instrument OCNI, (Patterson et al., 2013). Method: A secondary data analysis was carried out with ten maternal interviews analyzed using a deductive Thematic Analysis. This was to identify maternal unmet needs as well as their perceptions of their adolescent children's unmet needs and determine whether the OCNI framework was suitable to identify unmet needs of mothers and adolescent children in an Irish context.Results: The study found cancer is a challenging emotional burden for both mothers and their adolescent children. Emotions related to cancer recurrence were particularly difficult to deal with. Mothers struggle to identify the unmet needs of adolescent children and recognize that they lack the skills to approach the children, which adds to the burden of their illness burden and feelings of guilt. Conclusions: The study highlights the need to provide safe spaces for patients and adolescent children to deal with their emotions, strengthen relationships and improve communication associated with maternal cancer as these have a significant impact in their lives and may lead to tension and conflict within families.

AB Entrepreneurship is defined as the effort to generate and create jobs and innovate leading to economic growth. Despite the importance that has been given to this phenomenon, inequalities regarding the ability to trigger and manage the entrepreneurial activity remain. This research aims to describe and account for the entrepreneurship levels, particularly in order to understand what leads certain countries' individuals to display higher levels of initiative to manage or create a high-growth business. In order to achieve this goal, a research program that includes annual assessments of entrepreneurial activity levels in several countries has been used-The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM), which is, currently, one of the main international research databases aiming to describe, analyse and compare the entrepreneurial process in a wide range of countries. The database studied in this work is the 2011 NES, containing 144 variables in which 136 are qualitative (97 ordinal qualitative and 39 nominal qualitative). The data were analysed transforming the ordinal qualitative variables in ordinal quantitative, where the answers were given in a Likert scale from 1 to 5. The sample of the database consists of 1852 national and regional entrepreneurship experts selected on the basis of reputation and experience (through a convenience sample approach). Our research used several multivariate analysis techniques, in particular the multiple linear regression analysis, the cluster analysis and the discriminant analysis. In general, our conclusions suggest that individuals who react quickly to opportunities seem to display better abilities of time management and are more willing to start a business. Our results also show that the national culture does not influence the individual ability of managing the personal life.

AB With the development of sensing technology and the popularization of quantified-self devices, there are increasing types of health-related data that can be sensed, visualized and presented to the user. However, most existing quantified-self applications are designed to support self-management and self-reflection; only a few studies so far have investigated the social aspect of quantified-self data. In this study, we investigated the social role of quantified-self data by introducing the design and evaluation of SocialBike-a digitally augmented bicycle that aims to increase the user's intrinsic motivation in physical activity through on-site quantified-self data sharing. We conducted a controlled experiment on a cycling simulation system. Two forms of SocialBike's on-bike display were evaluated with 36 participants. We used the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory to collect quantitative data about users' intrinsic motivation in physical activity; the cycling simulation system recorded quantitative data about user behavior. Qualitative data was collected through semi-structured interviews. We conducted paired sample t-test to analyze both types of quantitative data; qualitative data were analyzed by the method of thematic analysis. The results show that SocialBike's front display significantly increased users' intrinsic motivation in physical activity. A total of nine themes were identified from the qualitative analysis, providing supplementary explanations for the quantitative results and additional insights into the overall design.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore the data available and their use by Kenyan secondary school teachers and head teachers. Design/methodology/approach Using a qualitative case study design, this study utilised interviews and documentary evidence to explore the data available and their use within Kenyan schools. Findings The data available in Kenyan schools were similar except for context data which had slight variations between schools. Head teachers mainly used school-level data to monitor school functioning, plan and develop school-level policies which mainly focused on school and curriculum improvement but little on teacher improvement. Teacher improvement attempts were mostly via benchmarking. The results also show that Kenyan head teachers hide inspection reports from teachers and that some head teachers used data creatively than others. For example, one head teacher used data to start a feeding programme to support economically disadvantaged students. Teachers, however, mostly used classroom-level data to plan lessons and monitor students' progress.
   Originality/value Accountability and data use are at the centre of many school improvement efforts the world over. The last two decades, for example, show pressure on schools to account for the resources invested and for the education they provide to children mainly in the form of data. Regrettably, studies pay little attention to data use in schools within developing countries such as Kenya.

Open government data have grown rapidly to enhance civic engagement and the transparency of governmental authorities in many parts of the world. We used a mixed methods approach, including co-word analysis of a population of open government data followed by qualitative analysis of five carefully selected records mapped using the CIDOC CRM. A final step was to use FRBRoo, an extension of the CIDOC CRM, to map the instantiation of data records in a typical data-sharing scenario.

AB Purpose The digitalization of an organization implies centralizing the data collected. Nevertheless, the management of customer data in franchise networks is a delicate, complicated and little studied issue. The purpose of this paper is to investigate its challenges and the keys to success, by developing a conceptual framework resulting from a qualitative study and a literature review. Design/methodology/approach A qualitative study was carried out with around 30 franchisors, franchisees and franchise experts in the light of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The results of the qualitative study helped to clarify our theoretical framework and to position ourselves on the side of the founding theories of relationship marketing. A research model was then defined and tested using a quantitative survey administered to a total sample of 192 franchisors and franchisees. Findings The results of the various studies show that relationship quality, through inter-organizational commitment, explains the achievement of marketing performance in franchise networks. In addition, the place of relationship quality depends on four essential variables: inter-organizational communication, franchisee autonomy, technical and human resources and contractualization of customer data management. Originality/value This study focuses on a topic that has received very little attention, particularly in franchise networks. It uses a mixed-methods design that has enabled the identification of key variables contributing to the achievement of marketing and sales performance in a data management context.

AB Whole genome (DNA) sequencing is becoming part of routine care healthcare in England. Genomic data are most useful when pooled with other patients' data, meaning that clinicians may need to share data to effectively treat patients. We ran deliberative focus groups to explore views among 44 patients and members of the public about proposals for wider genomic data sharing for clinical care. Participants were briefed about genomic medicine and engaged in group and individual exercises to deliberate on the benefits and risks of using genomic data. Findings showed that participants supported wider sharing of genomic data within health services and naturally linked care and research activities. Nonetheless, they were concerned about managing flows of information to protect patient confidentiality and guard against unauthorised uses, now and over the long-term. Ongoing conversations with the public are needed to determine appropriate uses of genomic data and safeguards to inform service development.

AB Social networks are explored as educational tools, but results remain contradictory. The goal was to assess families' response to a Facebook group created to support class work and expand it to homes. Forty parents (27 mothers, 13 fathers) participated. A pre-experimental one-group post-test-only research design was followed. The group's activity was analysed using Gytrics, while interviews were conducted with parents. Quantitative results showed that the group had a significant impact: a high percentage joined the group, its reach was 100% (all participated), there were 15,875 visits, 502 publications (103 made by parents), 2823 reactions, Tuesdays and Thursdays were the most active days and 21:00-22:00 the most active hours. Qualitative results showed six themes: change in the perception of the subject, novel experience, interesting/positive, learning community, safe environment and reasons to join. The use of Facebook to support class work had a positive impact on parents, connecting school and family.

AB The Observer Video-Pro is a system for collecting, managing, analyzing, and presenting observational data It integrates The Observer software with time code and multimedia hardware components. It extends the functionality of a conventional real-time event recording program in various ways. Observational data can be collected, reviewed, and edited with synchronized display of the corresponding video images. For optimal visual feedback during coding, one can display the video image in a window on the computer screen. Video playback from either a VCR or a digital media file can be controlled by the computer, allowing software-controlled jog, shuttle, and search functions. Besides a wide range of VCRs, The Observer Video-Pro supports all major digital video file formats. The software allows the user to summarize research findings in numerical, graphical, or multimedia format. One can create a time-event plot for a quick glance at the temporal structure of the observed process, or run specific analysis procedures and generate reports with statistics. An Event Summary function is available for exploratory and qualitative analysis. Video material can be summarized in a Video Play List, which allows on-screen summary presentations or the creation of highlight compilations on tape, CD, or other media. Video images can be captured and saved as disk files, for use as illustrations in documents, slides for presentations, and so forth. In this paper we describe the design and operation of the system, illustrated with a case study from research on Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI).

AB The paper argues that existing research on information quality (IQ) mainly focuses on the primary use of electronic health record (EHR) data, whereas IQ in secondary use of EHR data needs further deliberation. The current view of IQ in a healthcare context is static. It assumes that once the EHR system generates the information product, individual users may act on the information based on their subjective perception of its quality. However, this view ignores the complexities of secondary use of EHR data, in which users are actively involved in (re)generating and communicating the information product. Thus, IQ does not remain static but keeps on transforming through active engagement and interpersonal communication. To contribute to this debate, we conducted a qualitative case study in a Norwegian healthcare context by employing an IQ life cycle model. In conclusion, we enhanced the existing IQ model by (1) adding interpersonal communication, (2) showing the interrelations of the IQ dimensions, and (3) integrating the mechanisms of the transformation process for IQ in secondary use of EHR data. In doing so, we unfold the dynamics of IQ in the secondary use of EHR data.

AB While many disciplines embrace the possibilities that Big Data present for advancing scholarship and practice, organizational and management research has yet to realize Big Data's potential. In an effort to chart this newfound territory, we briefly describe the principal drivers and key characteristics of Big Data. We then review a broad range of opportunities and risks that are related to the Big Data paradigm, the data itself, and the associated analytical methods. For each, we provide research ideas and recommendations on how to embrace the potentials or address the concerns. Our assessment shows that Big Data, as a paradigm, can be a double-edged sword, capable of significantly advancing our field but also causing backlash if not utilized properly. Our review seeks to inform individual research practices as well as a broader policy agenda in order to advance organizational and management research as a scientifically rigorous and professionally relevant field.

TI Benefits and Shortcomings of Direct-to-Consumer Hearing Devices:
   Analysis of Large Secondary Data Generated From Amazon Customer Reviews
SO JOURNAL OF SPEECH LANGUAGE AND HEARING RESEARCH

DT Review
ID OLDER-ADULTS; HEALTH; AID; INFODEMIOLOGY; PERSPECTIVES
AB Purpose: The current study was aimed at understanding the benefits and shortcomings of direct-to-consumer hearing devices (DCHDs) by analyzing the large text corpus of secondary data generated from Amazon customer reviews.
   Method: Secondary data were generated manually by gathering user feedback for 62 different DCHDs (cost range: $9.95-$635) on the Amazon.com website, which included 11,258 unique Amazon-verified customer reviews. The data were analyzed using both quantitative and qualitative analyses methods.
   Results: The cluster analysis of large data corpus resulted in 7 unique clusters, which were labeled as (a) Issues related to fit and comfort (15%), (b) Friends and family recommendations (11.8%), (c) Issues related to sound quality (11.9%), (d) Listening and conversation (16.1%), (e) Positive customer service (12.1%), (f) General usage and customer service (14.7%), and (g) Cost and affordability (17.3%). Exploratory analysis also revealed an association between customer ratings and cost in relation to these clusters (i.e., customer reviews). For example, customer reviews about cheaper DCHDs are related to issues about sound quality, whereas reviews about expensive DCHDs are related to cost and affordability of the device. The qualitative content analysis resulted in 8 main themes, which include (a) intrinsic factors, (b) extrinsic factors, (c) supplemental items, (d) ease of use, (e) interaction with support services, (f) reasons for purchase, (g) experiences, and (h) general information.
   Conclusions: The study using the text mining techniques highlights the benefits and shortcomings of DCHDs that are currently available in the U.S. market. Our findings relate well to the published study results of electroacoustic analysis on similar products, which provide clinicians with knowledge related to DCHDs that they can convey to consumers during clinical consultations. The findings may also be of interest to the hearing instrument industry from the perspective of developing products based on user feedback.

AB The purpose of this critical review is to synthesize available literature and identify factors influencing consumer data sharing preferences, while presenting a logic model for legal / public policy development that aligns with consumer expectations for management of ePHI. Eighteen articles were included for the critical review; including 16 studies from three countries. The fourteen cross-sectional studies were evaluated using Olsen and St. George's (2004) Crosssectional Study Design and Data Analysis framework and two qualitative studies were assessed using Kuper, Lingard, Et Levinson (2008) [14] Critically Appraising Qualitative Research strategies. An emerging classification schema of statistically significant factors identified in this critical review shows that, (1) Trust relationship, (2) Harm Threshold, (3) Balance Risk and Benefits, (4) Transparency of Data Exchange and (5) Access and Control of Data are important when considering how to best include the consumer voice in the development of legal / public policies related to the privacy, security and consent management of ePHI.

AB Background: We aimed to synthesise data on issues related to stakeholder perceptions of consent for the use of secondary data. To better understand the current literature available, we conducted a systematic literature review of healthcare consumer attitudes towards the secondary use and sharing of health administrative and clinical trial data.
   Methods: EMBASE/MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, PubMed, CINAHL, Informit Health Collection, PROSPERO Database of Systematic Reviews, PsycINFO and ProQuest databases were searched. Eligible articles included those reporting qualitative or quantitative original research and published in English. No restrictions were placed on publication dates, study design or disease setting. One author screened articles for eligibility and two authors were involved in the full-text review process. Conflicts were resolved by consensus. Quality and bias were assessed using the QualSyst criteria for qualitative studies.
   Results: This paper focuses on a subset of 47 articles identified from the wider search and focuses on the issue of consent. Issues related to privacy, trust and transparency, and attitudes of healthcare professionals and researchers to secondary use and sharing of data have been dealt with in previous publications. Studies included a total of 216,149 respondents. Results indicate that respondents are generally supportive of using health data for research, particularly if the data is de-identified or anonymised. The requirement by participants to obtain consent prior to the use of health data for research was not universal, nor is the requirement for this always supported by legislation. Many respondents believed that either no consent or being informed of the research, but not providing additional consent, were sufficient.
   Conclusions: These results indicate that individuals should be provided with information and choice about how their health data is used and, where feasible, a mechanism to opt-out should be provided. To increase the acceptability of using health data for research, health organisations and data custodians must provide individuals with concise information about data protection mechanisms and under what circumstances their data may be used and by whom.

EMBASE/MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, PubMed, CINAHL, Informit Health Collection, PROSPERO Database of Systematic Reviews, PsycINFO, and ProQuest databases were searched. Eligible articles included those reporting qualitative or quantitative original research and published in English. No restrictions were placed on publication dates, study design or disease setting. One author screened articles for eligibility, and two authors were involved in the full text review process. Data was extracted using a pre-piloted data extraction template by one author and checked by another. Conflicts were resolved by consensus. Quality and bias were assessed using the QualSyst criteria for qualitative and quantitative studies. This paper focuses on a subset of 35 articles identified from the wider search which focus on issues of privacy, trust, and transparency. Studies included a total of 56,365 respondents. Results of this systematic literature review indicate that while respondents identified advantages in sharing health data, concerns relating to trust, transparency, and privacy remain. Organisations collecting health data and those who seek to share data or undertake secondary data analysis should continue to develop trust, transparency, and privacy with healthcare consumers through open dialogue and education. Consideration should be given to these issues at all stages of data collection including the conception, design, and implementation phases. While individuals understand the benefits of health data sharing for research purposes, ensuring a balance between public benefit and individual privacy is essential. Researchers and those undertaking secondary data analysis need to be cognisant of these key issues at all stages of their research.

ID PRIVACY
AB What do social media users think about social media data mining? To date, this question has been researched through quantitative studies that produce diverse findings and qualitative studies adopting either a privacy or a surveillance perspective. In this article, we argue that qualitative research which moves beyond these dominant paradigms can contribute to answering this question, and we demonstrate this by reporting on focus group research in three European countries (the United Kingdom, Norway and Spain). Our method created a space in which to make sense of the diverse findings of quantitative studies, which relate to individual differences (such as extent of social media use or awareness of social media data mining) and differences in social media data mining practices themselves (such as the type of data gathered, the purpose for which data are mined and whether transparent information about data mining is available). Moving beyond privacy and surveillance made it possible to identify a concern for fairness as a common trope among users, which informed their varying viewpoints on distinct data mining practices. We argue that this concern for fairness can be understood as contextual integrity in practice (Nissenbaum, 2009) and as part of broader concerns about well-being and social justice.

AB Objective
   To obtain a comprehensive understanding of the job opinions of hospital professionals by conducting qualitative analyses of the open comments included in a job satisfaction survey and combining these results with the quantitative results.
   Design
   A cross-sectional survey targeting all Lausanne University Hospital professionals was performed in the fall of 2013.
   Material and methods
   The survey considered ten job satisfaction dimensions (e.g. self-fulfilment, workload, management, work-related burnout, organisational commitment, intent to stay) and included an open comment section. Computer-assisted qualitative analyses were conducted on these comments. Satisfaction rates on the included dimensions and professional groups were entered as predictive variables in the qualitative analyses.
   Participants
   Of 10 838 hospital professionals, 4978 participated in the survey and 1067 provided open comments. Data from 1045 respondents with usable comments constituted the analytic sample (133 physicians, 393 nurses, 135 laboratory technicians, 247 administrative staff, including researchers, 67 logistic staff, 44 psycho-social workers, and 26 unspecified).
   Results
   Almost a third of the comments addressed scheduling issues, mostly related to problems and exhaustion linked to shifts, work-life balance, and difficulties with colleagues' absences and the consequences for quality of care and patient safety. The other two-thirds related to classic themes included in job satisfaction surveys. Although some comments were provided equally by all professional groups, others were group specific: work and hierarchy pressures for physicians, healthcare quality and patient safety for nurses, skill recognition for administrative staff. Overall, respondents' comments were consistent with their job satisfaction ratings.

ID SUBSTANCE-ABUSE TREATMENT; FAMILY-THERAPY; DRUG-TREATMENT;
   IMPLEMENTATION
AB Background: Adaptations to evidence-based substance abuse treatment programs may impact their effectiveness. A qualitative study of MET/CBT-5 implementation in community agencies treating adolescents found that the majority of the agencies made adaptations and that the most frequent adaptation was to provide more than five treatment sessions.
   Methods: Baseline and outcome data from SAMHSA's Effective Adolescent Treatment demonstration were analyzed to assess associations between length of treatment, client characteristics, and outcomes at three months.
   Results: Adolescents who received more or less than the protocol length of 5 sessions were less likely to be discharged to the community than those who received the 5 session protocol. Those who received more than five sessions were more likely to have higher severity scores at intake but almost 50% of those with more than five sessions had low intake severity scores. Clients who received less than five sessions tended to have lower severity scores than clients who received more than five sessions.
   Conclusions: Length of treatment tended to vary by site rather than severity of substance problems or frequency of use. There was no significant improvement of substance abuse problems or decrease in frequency of use with longer treatment. Implementation of the MET/CBT-5 component of the Cannabis Youth Treatment trial in the EAT project illustrates the difficulty of adherence to an evidence based protocol in the field.

AB Background: Digital health interventions have potential to contribute to better health outcomes, better healthcare and lower costs. However, evidence for their effectiveness is variable. The development and content of digital health interventions are often not described in enough detail to enable others to replicate the research or improve on previous interventions. This has led to a call for transparent reporting of intervention content and development.
   Purpose: To describe the development process and content of a digital self-management intervention for people with type 2 diabetes (HeLP-Diabetes) that has been found to achieve its target clinical outcome, the reduction of HbA1c, a measure of glycaemic control.
   Method: We synthesised theory, data from existing research evidence and international guidelines, and new qualitative data from target users to identify the determinants of self-management and the content to be included in HeLP-Diabetes. Using an ongoing iterative participatory design approach the content of the intervention was written, produced, reviewed and changed.
   Conclusion: It is possible to develop and transparently report self-management programmes for long-term conditions, which reflect current best evidence, theoretical underpinning and user involvement. We intend that reporting the development process and content will inform future digital intervention development.

TI Harnessing smart meter data for a Multitiered Energy Management

AB Energy management information systems (EMIS) play a critical role in providing actionable insights into building operations, timely feedback, and-ultimately-large energy savings. Current EMIS technologies often focus on industrial applications or require large upfront investments and trained operators, therefore greatly limiting its penetration into existing buildings. This paper integrates methods from social, building, and data sciences to understand limitations of current EMIS systems and inform the design of a new Multitiered Energy Management Performance Indicators (MEMPI) framework for characterizing the energy performance of buildings. Specifically, we employed a mixed methods research approach in which we first conduct in-depth qualitative interviews of 10 facility managers and energy consultants. We utilize the insights from our interviews to inform the design of the MEMPI framework, which harnesses highly granular data from already installed advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) (i.e., smart meters). The MEMPI framework employs quantile regression to first benchmark the energy performance of buildings to each other and generate key performance indicators (KPIs). We apply the MEMPI framework to real data from 569 public school buildings in California and measure their energy performance across multiple time scales (e.g., daily, monthly, yearly). Finally, we conduct case studies to compare insights from the MEMPI framework to the perceptions of facility managers overseeing 8 schools through a mixed methods qualitative and quantitative post-interview survey. Results from the case study show that facility managers' perceptions of the performance of their schools were largely accurate, yet the poor energy performance from certain pieces of building equipment and operating schedules was overlooked by building managers. Overall, the MEMPI framework aims to bridge the gap between data-driven energy management models and qualitative domain knowledge held by facility managers to provide more comprehensive insights into the energy performance of buildings.

ID OPEN GOVERNMENT DATA; ICT-ADOPTION
AB Purpose This study aims to investigate how, in forming their policy towards open data (OD), art museums interact with the OD ecosystems they are part of, comprising internal and external components such as cultural policy, legal frameworks, user groups and economic conditions and incentives. Design/methodology/approach The authors structure their research as a multiple case study based on three OD ecosystems, each defined by a mid-sized European art museum at its centre. Qualitative analysis of the case studies proceeds from interviews with museum management staff and policy-related agencies in three European countries, in addition to document analysis. Findings The results of this study suggest that museums are sensitive towards their environments and respond to their ecosystem based on what is communicated within their networks. However, museums are not effective in communicating with their users, limiting the informational interdependence necessary for well-functioning OD ecosystems. EU policy appears to be a driving force along with national financial incentives, though institutional conditions are limiting progress. Advancing the field relies instead on an epistemological shift to understand the museum as part of a larger information network. Originality/value As the first comparative case study of art museum OD ecosystems that the authors are aware of, the study provides a qualitative analysis of the complex dynamics impacting OD policy within the mid-sized art museum. The authors identify specific dynamics that are thus far restricting further development of the OD ecosystem of the mid-sized European art museum.

AB International science funders and publishers are driving a growing trend in data sharing. There is mounting pressure on researchers in low- and middle-income settings to conform to new sharing policies, despite minimal empirically grounded accounts of the ethical challenges of implementing the policies in these settings. This study used in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with 48 stakeholders in Vietnam to explore the experiences, attitudes, and expectations that inform ethical and effective approaches to sharing clinical research data. Distinct views on the role of trust, respect, and reciprocity were among those that emerged to inform culturally appropriate best practices. We conclude by discussing the challenges that authors of data-sharing policies should consider in this unique context.

AB Big data have the potential to revolutionize the project management, but it is not clear how. Despite the growing interest, there is a paucity of exploratory research to assess the practice and the impact of big data tools and technologies on project management approaches and practices. To address this gap, in this article, we initially embrace the technological-organizational-environmental (TOE) framework as the research basis for the adoption process and conducts in-depth interviews with project managers from French organizations in different sectors. The synthesis of interviews reveals that many organizations are still in the early stage of the adoption process, mainly due to a lack of resources, especially expertise. Besides the factors of the three contexts of TOE, the project-level factors are also found to be critical for the adoption of big data in project management. Most of them adopted big data solutions to support them in the conception, definition, and execution phases of project management. Drawing on the findings, this article also provides guidelines to broaden the understanding of big data applications and their role in project management. Based on these results, we present a model with testable propositions and discuss insights that arise for organizations and project managers regarding how to apply big data tools and technologies to create value and overcome the related challenges.

AB Through a literature review, this paper proposes an assessment framework to evaluate environmental open data in urban platforms under the data life cycle approach. For this purpose, a set of quantitative and qualitative indicators has been defined for each of the stages of the data life cycle: acquisition, access, analysis, and application. As confirmation of the capabilities of this approach, we illustrate the results of its application in six data portals along with analyses, comparisons, and conclusions regarding the results. The cases reveal that an interest exists in providing environmental information, but the capability to transform the data information into knowledge relevant for cities is rather low.

AB Girls' uptake of physical science, technology, engineering and mathematics (PSTEM) degrees continues to be poor. Identifying and targeting interventions for girl groups that are likely to go into STEM degrees may be a possible solution. This paper, using a self-determination theory and self-socialisation framework, determines whether one girl group's, "geek girls", video gaming behaviour is associated with their choice of undergraduate degree by using two secondary datasets: a cross-sectional study of the Net Generation (n = 814) and the Longitudinal Study of Young People in England (LSYPE) dataset (n = 7342). Chi-square analysis shows that girls who were currently studying a PSTEM degree were more likely to be garners and engage in multiplayer garners. Further, using logistic regressions, girls who were heavy garners ( > 9 h/wk) at 13-14 years were found to be more likely to pursue a PSTEM degree but this was influenced by their socio-economic status. Similar associations with boys and PSTEM degrees were not found or were weak. Therefore, girls were self-socialising or self determining their identity groups through gaming. This research can provide the basis for whether encouraging gaming in adolescent girls can help them onto PSTEM pathways.

AB Background: The European Commission is funding projects that aim to establish data-sharing platforms. These platforms are envisioned to enhance and facilitate the international sharing of cohort data. Nevertheless, broad data sharing may be restricted by the lack of adequate recognition for those who share data.
   Objective: The aim of this study is to describe in depth the concerns about acquiring credit for data sharing within epidemiological research.
   Methods: A total of 17 participants linked to European Union-funded data-sharing platforms were recruited for a semistructured interview. Transcripts were analyzed using inductive content analysis.
   Results: Interviewees argued that data sharing within international projects could challenge authorship guidelines in multiple ways. Some respondents considered that the acquisition of credit for articles with extensive author lists could be problematic in some instances, such as for junior researchers. In addition, universities may be critical of researchers who share data more often than leading research. Some considered that the evaluation system undervalues data generators and specialists. Respondents generally looked favorably upon alternatives to the current evaluation system to potentially ameliorate these issues.
   Conclusions: The evaluation system might impede data sharing because it mainly focuses on first and last authorship and undervalues the contributor's work. Further movement of crediting models toward contributorship could potentially address this issue. Appropriate crediting mechanisms that are better aligned with the way science ought to be conducted in the future need to be developed.

AB Background: Schools are ideal environments in which to conduct child and adolescent physical activity (PA) research. Despite this, PA-specific practical guidance for school-based research is lacking, which may present unique challenges to researchers. Based on reflections from our own experiences, this paper seeks to provide practical guidance on how best to approach school-based PA data collection. Discussion: This paper focuses on the practicalities of quantitative and qualitative data collection in English primary (4-11 years) and secondary (11-16 years) schools. Recruitment and consent are discussed, and practical guidance provided with respect to engagement with parent/carer(s) and ethical considerations. The importance of good communication with schools, together with its importance in facilitating efficient data collection (through planning, data collection and resource utilisation), is described. Finally, the importance of giving back to the school and participants once a research project has been completed is stressed. Improved understanding of data collection procedures for school-based PA research is key to helping research become more systematic and efficient. Findings in this paper will be particularly useful to undergraduate and postgraduate students and early career researchers.

AB School districts increasingly push school leaders to utilize multiple measures of teacher effectiveness, such as observation ratings or value-added scores, in making talent management decisions, including teacher hiring, assignment, support, and retention, but we know little about the local conditions that promote or impede these processes. We investigate the barriers to principals' use of teacher effectiveness measures in eight urban districts and charter management organizations that are investing in new systems for collecting such measures and making them available to school leaders and the supports central offices are building to help principals overcome those barriers. Interviews with more than 175 central and school leaders identify barriers in three main areas related to accessing measures, analyzing them, and taking action based on their analysis. Supports fall into four categories: professional development, connecting principals to sources of expertise, creating new structures or tools, and building a data use culture. Survey analysis suggests that indeed principals in high support systems perceive lower barriers to data use and report greater incorporation of teacher effectiveness measures into their talent management decisions.

AB This article investigates epistemological aspects of scientists' reuse of empirical data over decades and centuries. Giving examples, I discuss three respects in which empirical data are historical entities and the implications for the notion of data reuse. First, any data reuse necessitates metadata, which specify the data's circumstances of origin. Second, interpretation of historical data often requires the tools of humanities disciplines, which produce a further historicization of data. Finally, some qualitative social scientists hold that data are personal to the researcher who coconstructs them in the research process and are therefore skeptical about the prospects of reusing data.

AB Purpose This study aimed to develop a taxonomy of research areas in open government data (OGD) through a bibliometric mapping tool and a qualitative analysis software.Design/methodology/approach In this study, the authors extracted metadata of 442 documents from a bibliographic database. The authors used a bibliometric mapping tool for familiarization with the literature. After that, the authors used qualitative analysis software to develop taxonomy.Findings This paper developed taxonomy of OGD with three research areas: implementation and management, architecture, users and utilization. These research areas are further analyzed into seven topics and twenty-eight subtopics. The present study extends Charalabidis et al. (2016) taxonomy by adding two research topics, namely the adoption factors and barriers of OGD implementations and OGD ecosystems. Also, the authors include artificial intelligence in the taxonomy as an emerging research interest in the literature. The authors suggest four directions for future research: indigenous knowledge in open data, open data at local governments, development of OGD-specific theories and user studies in certain research themes.Practical implications Early career researchers and doctoral students can use the taxonomy to familiarize themselves with the literature. Also, established researchers can use the proposed taxonomy to inform future research. Taxonomy-building procedures in this study are applicable to other fields.Originality/value This study developed a novel taxonomy of research areas in OGD. Taxonomy building is significant because there is insufficient taxonomy of research areas in this discipline. Also, conceptual knowledge through taxonomy creation is a basis for theorizing and theory-building for future studies.

TI Using Data to Keep Vaccines Cold in Kenya: Remote Temperature Monitoring
   with Data Review Teams for Vaccine Management
SO GLOBAL HEALTH-SCIENCE AND PRACTICE
LA English
DT Review
ID CHAIN; EXPOSURE; TECHNOLOGY
AB Background: Global vaccination coverage rates have remained around 85% for the past several years. Increasing immunization coverage rates requires an effective cold chain to maintain vaccine potency. Remote temperature monitoring (RTM) technology for vaccine refrigerators has shown promise for improving the ability of supply systems to maintain optimal temperature conditions to ensure potent vaccines reach the end users.
   Methods: A pilot study of RTM technology and data use teams was implemented in 36 study sites in Kenya. Data were collected at baseline and endline points over a 3-month baseline and 7-month implementation period. Data included 44 qualitative interviews, process logs, meeting minutes from data use team meetings, and quantitative temperature and power data from the RTM devices.
   Results: The ability of cold chain equipment to maintain World Health Organization-recommended temperatures in study sites improved markedly between the baseline and implementation periods, resulting in an improvement in total time spent in the correct range from 83.9% in the baseline period to 90.9% in the intervention period and an improvement in time spent in the too cold range from 6.5% to 1.5%. Friedman tests revealed that differences in time spent in the correct range and time spent in the too cold range during the course of the study were statistically significant (P<.001 and P=.04, respectively). Qualitative and quantitative data suggest that this improvement was due to a combination of improved responsiveness to temperature excursions at the facility level, resulting from SMS alarms for temperature excursion periods, and improved ability at the management level to recognize and address recurring problems.
   Conclusion: The combination of using RTM technology with a structured data review process by a management team is a promising approach for improving cold chain outcomes. Future research examining the added value of each of the technological and behavioral components separately is needed.

AB Background Due to increased demand from older adults who live in the immediate vicinity of a few nursing homes, a large care provider in the community expanded its residential care service to include home care services. To be successful with such a strategy an orientation towards the needs and the ability to change as well as the willingness of employees to change is of exceptional importance. Aim of the secondary data analysis Identification of factors that have influenced the need, the ability and eagerness for change. The focus of the article lies on the willingness of the employees to change. Material and methods Based on 32 semi-structured interviews, which were conducted at 3 different times between 2016 and 2018 with 3 different groups of employees of the community care provider, a secondary data analysis was carried out using a content-structured qualitative content analysis. Results Employees' willingness to change was influenced by the following factors: the situational independent readiness for change (being ready for change regardless the situation?), conscious decision for the nursing home/ inpatient setting, the idea of the cross-sectoral care concept, the implementation of the cross-sectoral care concept, the recipients of nursing care/services, previous experience in home care. Conclusion The results offer insights into which factors influence the willingness of employees to change. These factors influence change so that they need to be known and taken into account.

AB Objective: To describe methods to determine sample sizes in surveys using open-ended questions and to assess how resampling methods can be used to determine data saturation in these surveys.
   Study Design and Setting: We searched the literature for surveys with open-ended questions and assessed the methods used to determine sample size in 100 studies selected at random. Then, we used Monte Carlo simulations on data from a previous study on the burden of treatment to assess the probability of identifying new themes as a function of the number of patients recruited.
   Results: In the literature, 85% of researchers used a convenience sample, with a median size of 167 participants (interquartile range [IQR] = 69-406). In our simulation study, the probability of identifying at least one new theme for the next included subject was 32%, 24%, and 12% after the inclusion of 30, 50, and 100 subjects, respectively. The inclusion of 150 participants at random resulted in the identification of 92% themes (IQR = 91-93%) identified in the original study.
   Conclusion: In our study, data saturation was most certainly reached for samples >150 participants. Our method may be used to determine when to continue the study to find new themes or stop because of futility. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Genomic and biosocial research data about individuals is rapidly proliferating, bringing the potential for novel opportunities for data integration and use. The scale, pace and novelty of these applications raise a number of urgent sociotechnical, ethical and legal questions, including optimal methods of data storage, management and access. Although the open science movement advocates unfettered access to research data, many of the UK's longitudinal cohort studies operate systems of managed data access, in which access is governed by legal and ethical agreements between stewards of research datasets and researchers wishing to make use of them. Amongst other things, these agreements aim to respect the reasonable expectations of the research participants who provided data and samples, as expressed in the consent process. Arguably, responsible data management and governance of data and sample use are foundational to the consent process in longitudinal studies and are an important source of trustworthiness in the eyes of those who contribute data to genomic and biosocial research.
   Methods: This paper presents an ethnographic case study exploring the foundational principles of a governance infrastructure for Managing Ethico-social, Technical and Administrative issues in Data ACcess (METADAC), which are operationalised through a committee known as the METADAC Access Committee. METADAC governs access to phenotype, genotype and 'omit' data and samples from five UK longitudinal studies.
   Findings: Using the example of METADAC, we argue that three key structural features are foundational for practising responsible data sharing: independence and transparency; interdisciplinarity; and participant-centric decision-making. We observe that the international research community is proactively working towards optimising the use of research data, integrating/linking these data with routine data generated by health and social care services and other administrative data services to improve the analysis, interpretation and utility of these data. The governance of these new complex data assemblages will require a range of expertise from across a number of domains and disciplines, including that of study participants. Human-mediated decision-making bodies will be central to ensuring achievable, reasoned and responsible decisions about the use of these data; the METADAC model described in this paper provides an example of how this could be realised.

AB This paper analyzes how different combinations of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) dimensions affect corporate economic performance. We use various dimensions of CSR to examine whether firms rely on different combinations of CSR, in terms of quality versus quantity of CSR practices. Our empirical analysis based on an original database including 10,293 French firms shows that different CSR dimensions in isolation impact positively firms' profits but their effect in term on intensity varies among CSR dimensions. Moreover, the findings on the qualitative CSR measure, based on interaction between its dimensions, show that the substitutability of these dimensions is highly significant for firm performance. However, in terms of the intensity, those interactions produce differential effects. Actually, asking whether a firm starting with a certain configuration cannot perform better by adding or removing some dimension(s) we found that only one configuration fulfills this requirement: green and HR. The interpretation is that when a firm starts with this configuration then it is better not to move to another configuration. In all other configurations, firms can always improve their profits either by adding or removing some dimensions. Finally, the profitability of CSR investments in French firms seems to rely on a specific qualitative mix of different CSR dimensions rather than a pure quantitative approach accumulating practices without designing a consistent set of interactions among them.

DE Immunization; Data management practice; Data quality; Information use
AB Introduction: Although data quality mainly depends upon the proper management of its primary sources, limited studies examined immunization data management practice in Ethiopia.
   Aim: To explore data management practices, facilitators, and barriers to immunization data quality among front-line immunization experts in the Tach Gayint district of Northwest Ethiopia.
   Methods: A mixed method study design was applied using document review and key-informant interviews. Quantitative data was collected through document review from 18 health facilities and 26 key-informant interviews, were conducted on experts of immunization for qualitative data. A STATA version 14.1 was used for quantitative data analysis. Qualitative data was transcribed verbatim and translated back into English. Data was coded, reduced, and searched for salient patterns. Thematic analysis was done using open-code version 4.02.
   Results: The Health Management Information System data recording tools were often lacking. The significant number (83.3%) of health facilities practiced immunization information display, while dissemination at the local level was low. The key informants mentioned that they were responsible for conducting regular Performance Monitoring Team (PMT) and Lots Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS) as facilitators. Furthermore, a shortage of recording tools. limited supportive supervision, vertical reporting, impracticality of Lots of Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS) at the health posts. poor implementation of Community Health Information System (CHIS), and mass vaccination were barriers identified to immunization data quality.
   Conclusion: We found that majority of health workers use locally developed tools instead of using the standard data recording and reporting tools. Regular Performance Monitoring Team meetings and Lots Quality Assurance Sampling assessment were found to be facilitators. Furthermore, limited supportive supervision, vertical reporting and poor implementation of Community Health Information System were barriers. Therefore, strengthening the use of standard recording and reporting tools. conducting regular supportive supervision. and implementing routine vaccination services are recommended to improve the data management practice.

AB It is increasingly recognized that effective and appropriate data sharing requires the development of models of good data-sharing practice capable of taking seriously both the potential benefits to be gained and the importance of ensuring that the rights and interests of participants are respected and that risk of harms is minimized. Calls for the greater sharing of individual-level data from biomedical and public health research are receiving support among researchers and research funders. Despite its potential importance, data sharing presents important ethical, social, and institutional challenges in low-income settings. In this article, we report on qualitative research conducted in five low- and middle-income countries exploring the experiences of key research stakeholders and their views about what constitutes good data-sharing practice.

AB Introduction International policy imperatives for the public and patient involvement in the governance of health data coexist with conflicting cross-border policies on data sharing. This can challenge the planning and implementation of participatory data governance in healthcare services locally. Engaging with local stakeholders and understanding how their needs, values and preferences for governing health data can be articulated with policies made at the supranational level is crucial. This paper describes a protocol for a project that aims to coproduce a people-centred model for involving patients and the public in decision-making processes about the use and sharing of health data for rare diseases care and research. Methods and analysis This multidisciplinary project draws on an explanatory sequential mixed-methods study. A hospital-based survey with patients, informal carers, health professionals and technical staff recruited at two reference centres for rare diseases in Portugal will be conducted first. The qualitative study will follow consisting of semi-structured interviews and scenario-based workshops with a subsample of the participant groups recruited at baseline. Quantitative data will be analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Inductive and deductive approaches will be combined to analyse the qualitative interviews. Data from scenario-based workshops will be iteratively compared using the constant comparison method to identify cross-cutting themes and categories. Ethics and dissemination The Ethics Committee for Health from the University Hospital Centre Sao Joao/Faculty of Medicine of University of Porto approved the study protocol (Ref. 99/19). Research findings will be disseminated at academic conferences and science promotion events, and through public meetings involving patient representatives, practitioners, policy-makers and students, a project website and peer-reviewed journal publications.

AB This paper seeks to extend debate on the use of blogs as qualitative data, specifically focusing on the issue of consent in research that uses publicly available but personal content. Typically the argument has been made for the need to protect individual writers and engage with these documents in a considered manner that recognises the inherent vulnerability of amateur authors. This paper will argue that a framing of these writers that foregrounds their potential vulnerability, naivety and even ignorance is in fact highly paternalistic, and therefore counter to an ethical approach to research. In seeking to protect authors from harm, we deny their agency and diminish the act of online publication. Further, this approach, prevalent in academia, is at odds with the legal position, and arguably, the weight of social understanding. A reframing of amateur online authors as informed agents not only increases the accessibility of these data to researchers and subsequently policy makers, but also alludes to a need to credit the contribution of authors without the need to seek permission. Ultimately, this paper argues for a presumption of accountability, unless otherwise proven, and an approach to the use of self-published online material that mirrors the use of other sorts of secondary data with perceived "professional" authors, such as magazine articles, newspaper columns or organisational literature.

AB Open data platforms are hoped to foster democratic processes, yet recent empirical research shows that so far they have failed to do so. We argue that current open data platforms do not take into account the complexity of democratic processes which results in overly simplistic approaches to open data platform design. Democratic processes are multifaceted and open data can be used for various purposes, with diverging roles, rules and tools by citizens and public administrators. This study develops a Democratic Activity Model of Open Data Use, which is illustrated by anexploratory qualitative multiple case study outlining three democratic processes: monitorial, deliberative and participatory. We find that each type of democratic process requires a different approach and open data design. We conclude that a context -sensitive open data design facilitates the transformation of raw data into meaningful information constructed collectively by public administrators and citizens.

AB BackgroundSecondary use of data via integrated health information technology is fundamental to many healthcare policies and processes worldwide. However, repurposing data can be problematic and little research has been undertaken into the everyday practicalities of inter-system data sharing that helps explain why this is so, especially within (as opposed to between) organisations. In response, this article reports one of the most detailed empirical examinations undertaken to date of the work involved in repurposing healthcare data for National Clinical Audits.MethodsFifty-four semi-structured, qualitative interviews were carried out with staff in five English National Health Service hospitals about their audit work, including 20 staff involved substantively with audit data collection. In addition, ethnographic observations took place on wards, in 'back offices' and meetings (102h). Findings were analysed thematically and synthesised in narratives.ResultsAlthough data were available within hospital applications for secondary use in some audit fields, which could, in theory, have been auto-populated, in practice staff regularly negotiated multiple, unintegrated systems to generate audit records. This work was complex and skilful, and involved cross-checking and double data entry, often using paper forms, to assure data quality and inform quality improvements.ConclusionsIf technology is to facilitate the secondary use of healthcare data, the skilled but largely hidden labour of those who collect and recontextualise those data must be recognised. Their detailed understandings of what it takes to produce high quality data in specific contexts should inform the further development of integrated systems within organisations.

AB This study examines knowledge, attitudes, and communication practices toward genomic data sharing among principal investigators and research coordinators engaged in cancer and non-cancer studies. We conducted 25 individual semi-structured interviews and conducted a qualitative thematic analysis. Most interviewees had basic knowledge of data sharing requirements, but lacked specific details of recent changes to NIH policy. Principal investigators perceived more risks to participants for data sharing than the research coordinators who generally obtained consent. Interviewees perceived a trend toward providing fewer data sharing options to participants in the consent process, and had observed that parents of pediatric patients asked more questions than adult patients. Our findings highlight potential areas for improvement related to data sharing during consent processes.

AB We have investigated how first-year and second-year university students judge the quality of secondary experimental data consisting of measurements of covarying quantities, and to what extent they consider multiple measurements of covarying quantities as a single data set characterised by its mean and spread. Five cohorts of students at two universities participated in the study. They offered written responses to three open-ended questions. Individual follow-up interviews were conducted with fourteen students that were based on their previous written answers to understand their reasoning in more depth. A fine-grained analysis was undertaken to unpack students' reasoning by grouping the criteria they used to judge the quality of the data into three broad categories: criteria independent of the data, criteria that based on the variation of the raw data, and criteria based on the variation of the derived quantity. We argue that responses in each category can be linked to different learning objectives. The students proposed various actions to increase the trustworthiness of the covarying data or a conclusion based on it. We have investigated to what extent decisions and proposed actions were consistent. Students generally showed a fragmented and primarily qualitative understanding of the concepts of mean, uncertainty, and line of best fit. Many students proposed to determine the value of a derived quantity by applying the equation relating it to the measurands to individual data points, all data points, or all data points except for outliers. Students appear to consider the best fit line as a tool for eliminating outliers, but much less frequently as a way to determine a derived quantity. We discuss implications for instructional practice and further research.

AB Government funding entities have placed data sharing at the centre of scientific policy. While there is widespread consensus that scientific data sharing benefits scientific progress, there are significant barriers to its wider adoption. We seek a deeper understanding of how researchers from different fields share their data and the barriers and facilitators of such sharing. We draw upon the notions of epistemic cultures and collective action theory to consider the enablers and deterrents that scientists encounter when contributing to the collective good of data sharing. Our study employs a mixed-methods design by combining survey data collected in 2016 and 2018 with qualitative data from two case studies sampled within two scientific communities: high-energy physics and molecular biology. We describe how scientific communities with different epistemic cultures can employ modularity, time delay, and boundary organisations to overcome barriers to data sharing.

AB This article examines the tension between transparency and privacy that public administrators face as they build multi-agency integrated data systems and work with researchers to harness the power of administrative data to inform policymaking. Analysis of qualitative data from 71 interviews with administrators and university researchers in four State Longitudinal Data System (SLDS) states (Maryland, Texas, Virginia, and Washington) and the U.S. Department of Education indicates the important effect that executive leadership, consistent and sound legal advice, and assessment of risk tolerance at the agency level can have on the structure and function of the overall project. Learning how to navigate this challenge and foster agency-researcher partnerships is fundamental for generating evidence-based research in public administration and policy.

AB The purpose of this study was to explore low-income lone mothers' perceptions of their engagement with a text (SMS) and multimedia message (MMS) qualitative study. Study participants were asked to submit text and pictures via SMS and MMS that represented their reflections, observations, and experiences accessing community support services over a 6-week period. After engaging in the study, participants were asked to complete an evaluation questionnaire. The resoundingly positive feedback received in the evaluation-and the researchers' satisfaction with the data collected-suggests that researchers should consider employing SMS and MMS data collection strategies to gain open-ended insights into the daily experiences of marginalized groups. This method may be particularly well suited to feminist research designs and research with populations underrepresented in the literature due to barriers presented by traditional data collection strategies.

AB This study investigates scientists' data needs to provide a basis for professionals in research data management (RDM) to tailor services to meet those needs. Eighty-one participants completed a survey after they had asked a question at a Data Help Desk staffed by data management professionals at one of two science conferences. The qualitative responses were coded for common themes, and the quantitative questions were tabulated to compare results between the two conferences. The combined results provide an overview of scientists' questions and training experiences on RDM. The study found that 70 percent of scientists in the survey had no prior RDM training, and the most common RDM need for both ecologists and geologists was storage. This study provides evidence that scientists need additional information about RDM. Traditional service desk models offer one way of assisting them with data needs, but the results indicate a need for more training to meet the expectations of data sharing. Academic and other libraries should consider expanding hours and services for RDM to provide help where and when scientists need it.

AB Land resource intensive use (LRIU) is the future direction of land natural resource management with significant implications for sustainable development. Henceforth, this study examines the impact mechanism of land natural resource use on sustainable development using China's provincial data from 2008 to 2020. The results reveal that LRIU promotes sustainable development in both quantitative and qualitative terms, and these effects remain valid after robustness and endogeneity tests. However, these influences substantially vary across geographic locations and development stages. LRIU mainly achieves sustainable development by curbing the inflated industrial restructuring and driving technological progress. These findings suggest that LRIU policy should be decisively implemented according to site-specific conditions, giving full play to its impact on industrial restructuring and technological progress.

LA English
DT Article
ID MOBILITY
AB Debate continues in many European countries about both equality of opportunity and the continuing wastage of talent, and the ways in which differing systems of secondary schooling contribute to these. Drawing on Turner's concepts of sponsored and contest mobility and on Allmendinger's classification along the dimensions of stratification and selection, we describe the amount of flexibility currently in the German secondary school system which, despite ongoing reforms, is still stratified and selective. Earlier research suggests that the sorting process is socially, not just academically, selective. Building on this, we analyse factors influencing whether individuals make use of the available opportunities for changing track. We find that, rather than alleviating the early social inequality, these opportunities reinforce it since young people from more privileged backgrounds are more likely to benefit from flexibility, whereas disadvantaged individuals are more likely to drop out of the academic track. Most earlier relevant work has used regression-based methods, but we use an alternative configurational method, Ragin's Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA). Using this set theoretic approach allows us, when exploring what conjunctions of factors are sufficient conditions for the types of mobility we focus upon, to move beyond the limitations of a 'net effects' approach.

AB Background: Nursing is becoming a mobile profession. Nurse migration is multifactorial and not limited to financial incentives. Non-economic factors that might lead to migration include poor recruitment and retention strategies, poor job satisfaction and working conditions, socio-political and economic stability, and the poor social image of the nursing profession. Lebanon is facing a problem of excessive nurse migration to countries of the Gulf, North America and Europe. No study has been conducted to understand the determinants and magnitude of the problem.
   Objective: The objective of this study is to provide an evidence base for understanding the incidence of nurse migration out of Lebanon, its magnitude and reasons.
   Design: A cross-sectional research design comprising both quantitative and qualitative methods was employed to achieve the stated objectives. This includes a survey of nursing schools in Lebanon, survey of nurse recruitment agencies, secondary data analysis and survey of migrant nurses.
   Results: An estimated one in five nurses that receive a bachelors of science in nursing migrates out of Lebanon within 1 or 2 years of graduation. The majority of nurses migrate to countries of the Gulf. The main reasons for migration included: shift work, high patient/nurse ratios, lack of autonomy in decision-making, lack of a supportive environment, and poor commitment to excellent nursing care. Further, nurses reported that combinations of financial and non-financial incentives can encourage them to return to practice in Lebanon. The most recurring incentives (pull factors) to encourage nurses to return to practice in Lebanon included educational support, managerial support, better working conditions, utilization of best nursing practices and autonomy.
   Conclusion: Nurse migration and retention have become major health workforce issues confronting many health systems in the East Mediterranean Region. Our study demonstrated that nurse migration is a product of poor management and lack of effective-retention strategies and sufficient knowledge about the context, needs and challenges facing nurses. Nurse migration in Lebanon underscores the importance of developing a monitoring system that would identify implications and help implement innovative retention strategies. Nurse migration out of Lebanon is likely to persist and even increase if underlying factors are not properly resolved. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study explores behavioral health professionals' perceptions of granular data. Semi-structured in-person interviews of 20 health professionals were conducted at two different sites. Qualitative and quantitative analysis was performed. While most health professionals agreed that patients should control who accesses their personal medical record (70%), there are certain types of health information that should never be restricted (65%). Emergent themes, including perceived reasons that patients might share or withhold certain types of health information (65%), care coordination (12%), patient comprehension (11%), stigma (5%), trust (3%), sociocultural understanding (3%), and dissatisfaction with consent processes (1%), are explored. The impact of care role (prescriber or non-prescriber) on data-sharing perception is explored as well. This study informs the discussion on developing technology that helps balance provider and patient data-sharing and access needs.

AB This study investigates which combination of institutional and infrastructural arrangements positively impact research data sharing and reuse in a specific case. We conducted a qualitative case study of the institutional and infrastructural arrangements implemented at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands. In the examined case, it was fundamental to change the mindset of researchers and to make them aware of the benefits of sharing data. Therefore, arrangements should be designed bottom-up and used as a "carrot" rather than as a "stick." Moreover, support offered to researchers should cover at least legal, financial, administrative, and practical issues of research data management and should be informal in nature. Previous research describes generic institutional and infrastructural instruments that can stimulate open research data sharing and reuse. This study is among the first to analyze what and how infrastructural and institutional arrangements work in a particular context. It provides the basis for other scholars to study such arrangements in different contexts. Open data policymakers, universities, and open data infrastructure providers can use our findings to stimulate data sharing and reuse in practice, adapted to the contextual situation. Our study focused on a single case and a particular part of the university. We recommend repeating this research in other contexts, that is, at other universities, faculties, and involving other research data infrastructure providers.

AB Research assessing attitudes toward consent processes for high-throughput genomic-wide technologies and widespread sharing of data is limited. In order to develop a better understanding of stakeholder views toward these issues, this cross-sectional study assessed public and biorepository participant attitudes toward research participation and sharing of genetic research data. Forty-nine individuals participated in 6 focus groups; 28 in 3 public focus groups and 21 in 3 NUgene biorepository participant focus groups. In the public focus groups, 75% of participants were women, 75% had some college education or more, 46% were African-American and 29% were Hispanic. In the NUgene focus groups, 67% of participants were women, 95% had some college education or more, and the majority (76%) of participants was Caucasian. Five major themes were identified in the focus group data: (a) a wide spectrum of understanding of genetic research; (b) pros and cons of participation in genetic research; (c) influence of credibility and trust of the research institution; (d) concerns about sharing genetic research data and need for transparency in the Policy for Sharing of Data in National Institutes of Health-Supported or Conducted Genome-Wide Association Studies; (e) a need for more information and education about genetic research. In order to increase public understanding and address potential concerns about genetic research, future efforts should be aimed at involving the public in genetic research policy development and in identifying or developing appropriate educational strategies to meet the public's needs.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between research data management (RDM) and data sharing in the formulation of RDM policies and development of practices in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs).
   Design/methodology/approach - Two strands of work were undertaken sequentially: first, content analysis of 37 RDM policies from UK HEIs; and second, two detailed case studies of institutions with different approaches to RDM based on semi-structured interviews with staff involved in the development of RDM policy and services. The data are interpreted using insights from Actor Network Theory.
   Findings - RDM policy formation and service development has created a complex set of networks within and beyond institutions involving different professional groups with widely varying priorities shaping activities. Data sharing is considered an important activity in the policies and services of HEIs studied, but its prominence can in most cases be attributed to the positions adopted by large research funders.
   Research limitations/implications - The case studies, as research based on qualitative data, cannot be assumed to be universally applicable but do illustrate a variety of issues and challenges experienced more generally, particularly in the UK.
   Practical implications - The research may help to inform development of policy and practice in RDM in HEIs and funder organisations.
   Originality/value - This paper makes an early contribution to the RDM literature on the specific topic of the relationship between RDM policy and services, and openness - a topic which to date has received limited attention.

AB Government officials claim open data can improve internal and external communication and collaboration. These promises hinge on "data intermediaries'': extra-institutional actors that obtain, use, and translate data for the public. However, we know little about why these individuals might regard open data as a site of civic participation. In response, we draw on Ilana Gershon to conceptualize culturally situated and socially constructed perspectives on data, or "data ideologies.'' This study employs mixed methodologies to examine why members of the public hold particular data ideologies and how they vary. In late 2015 the authors engaged the public through a commission in a diverse city of approximately 500,000. Qualitative data was collected from three public focus groups with residents. Simultaneously, we obtained quantitative data from surveys. Participants' data ideologies varied based on how they perceived data to be useful for collaboration, tasks, and translations. Bucking the "geek'' stereotype, only a minority of those surveyed (20%) were professional software developers or engineers. Although only a nascent movement, we argue open data intermediaries have important roles to play in a new political landscape.

AB Sharing individual-level data from clinical and public health research is increasingly being seen as a core requirement for effective and efficient biomedical research. This article discusses the results of a systematic review and multisite qualitative study of key stakeholders' perspectives on best practices in ethical data sharing in low- and middle-income settings. Our research suggests that for data sharing to be effective and sustainable, multiple social and ethical requirements need to be met. An effective model of data sharing will be one in which considered judgments will need to be made about how best to achieve scientific progress, minimize risks of harm, promote fairness and reciprocity, and build and sustain trust.

TI Measuring health data management maturity in Abu Dhabi
SO HEALTH POLICY AND TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB The World Economic Forum recently released a Global Health Data Charter. The objective of this qualitative case study was to determine if the Charter's eight principles, along with a set of data management practice standards, could be used as an assessment tool to determine the maturity of data management practices within a health organization. The Health Authority Abu Dhabi (HAAD) represented the bounded holistic case for this study. The data collection methods included structured interviews, completion of an assessment tool, and electronic documentation review. The findings demonstrated good to excellent compliance between HAAD's data management practices and the Charter principles, indicating a high level of data management maturity. Applying the Charter as the assessment framework proved to be successful. This framework provided a simple yet comprehensive approach to rapidly determine HAAD's level of health data management maturity. This assessment tool may prove to be useful for other health organizations. (C) 2012 Fellowship of Postgraduate Medicine. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This article explores different perspectives attributed to the open data initiatives and how these perspectives shape the opening-up process. A socio-technical lens, the social construction of technology, was used to analyse a qualitative cross-case study of two Swedish municipalities. Findings revealed two ways of interpreting open data initiatives: 1) as a platform for techno-economic growth and 2) as a platform for co-created societal growth. These two approaches addressed the municipalities respective contextual challenges and interests alongside national recommendations in their aims to realize the open data initiative. In doing so, they diverged into the evolvement toward two different ends: the realization of open data and the realization of open government. To excel the understanding of actions taken to meet these ends, an additional set of differences between these municipalities is provided within a sociotechnical framework that allows us to discuss diverging evolvements of open data initiatives based on agreed and non-agreed interpretations of what is believed to be constructed.

AB Background The highly sensitive nature of genomic and associated clinical data, coupled with the consent-related vulnerabilities of children together accentuate ethical, legal and social issues (ELSI) concerning data sharing. The Key Implications of Data Sharing (KIDS) framework was therefore developed to address a need for institutional guidance on genomic data governance but has yet to be validated among data sharing practitioners in practice settings. This study qualitatively explored areas of consensus and dissensus of the KIDS Framework from the perspectives of Canadian clinician-scientists, genomic researchers, IRB members, and pediatric ethicists. Methods Twelve panelists participated in a three-round online policy Delphi to determine the desirability, feasibility, relative importance and confidence of twelve individual statements of the KIDS Framework. Mean and IQR were calculated from panelists' ratings to determine the strength of consensus and polarity. Qualitative content analysis of panelists' written responses was used to assess degree of support. Statements were validated when their combined ratings and qualitative rationales indicated high-moderate consensus (at least 70% agreement across two contiguous categories), low to no polarity (IQR at least 1.0) and strong support. Results Nine original, and one new statement reached consensus. These statements outlined essential elements of the informed consent process, including a realistic evaluation of benefits and risks and assurance of future ethics oversight for secondary data use. Discrepant views on appropriate protections for anonymized and coded i.e. de-identified genomic data were primary sources of dissensus. Conclusions The validated statements provide institutions with empirically supported best practices for sharing genomic and associated clinical data involving children from the perspectives of key stakeholders. Concerted efforts to quantify informational risks that can be conveyed to patients and families are further needed to align data sharing policy with stakeholder priorities.

TI Data Reusers' Trust Development

DT Article
ID SECONDARY ANALYSIS; SCIENTIFIC-DATA; CONTEXT; MODEL
AB Data reuse refers to the secondary use of data-not for its original purpose but for studying new problems. Although reusing data might not yet be the norm in every discipline, the benefits of reusing shared data have been asserted by a number of researchers, and data reuse has been a major concern in many disciplines. Assessing data for trustworthiness becomes important in data reuse with the growth in data creation because of the lack of standards for ensuring data quality and potential harm from using poor-quality data. This research explores many facets of data reusers' trust in data generated by other researchers focusing on the trust judgment process with influential factors that determine reusers' trust. The author took an interpretive qualitative approach by using in-depth semistructured interviews as the primary research method. The study results suggest different stages of trust development associated with the process of data reuse. Data reusers' trust may remain the same throughout their experiences, but it can also be formed, lost, declined, and recovered during their data reuse experiences. These various stages reflect the dynamic nature of trust.

AB Background: In Brazil, secondary data for epidemiology are largely available. However, they are insufficiently prepared for use in research, even when it comes to structured data since they were often designed for other purposes. To date, few publications focus on the process of preparing secondary data. The present findings can help in orienting future research projects that are based on secondary data. Objective: Describe the steps in the process of ensuring the adequacy of a secondary data set for a specific use and to identify the challenges of this process. Methods: The present study is qualitative and reports methodological issues about secondary data use. The study material was comprised of 6,059,454 live births and 73,735 infant death records from 2004 to 2013 of children whose mothers resided in the State of Sao Paulo - Brazil. The challenges and description of the procedures to ensure data adequacy were undertaken in 6 steps: (1) problem understanding, (2) resource planning, (3) data understanding, (4) data preparation, (5) data validation and (6) data distribution. For each step, procedures, and challenges encountered, and the actions to cope with them and partial results were described. To identify the most labor-intensive tasks in this process, the steps were assessed by adding the number of procedures, challenges, and coping actions. The highest values were assumed to indicate the most critical steps. Results: In total, 22 procedures and 23 actions were needed to deal with the 27 challenges encountered along the process of ensuring the adequacy of the study material for the intended use. The final product was an organized database for a historical cohort study suitable for the intended use. Data understanding and data preparation were identified as the most critical steps, accounting for about 70% of the challenges observed for data using. Conclusion: Significant challenges were encountered in the process of ensuring the adequacy of secondary health data for research use, mainly in the data understanding and data preparation steps. The use of the described steps to approach structured secondary data and the knowledge of the potential challenges along the process may contribute to planning health research.

AB To enable more proactive management of the underlying sources of operational risks in financial institutions, this pre-registered study seeks to improve traditional qualitative approaches to causal factors analysis. A Bayesian network-based approach is used to leverage both incident and operations data to model the probability of operational loss events. The approach is applied and empirically tested in a case study on an Australian insurance company. The outputs from the model go beyond simply identifying key risk drivers to offer risk managers a deeper under-standing of how causal factors influence risk. Insights into the collective effects of causal factors, their relative importance and critical thresholds strategically inform more efficient and effective mitigation decisions, ultimately enhancing firm performance and value.

AB Open Government Data (OGD) initiatives are picking up across the globe with their emphasis upon the tenets of transparency, collaboration, and participation. While much of the research has remained confined at unraveling the theoretical and conceptual dimensions of OGD, empirical investigations are visibly lacking, especially in the African context. Using a qualitative research methodology, we analyze the responses received from relevant stakeholders-representatives from public and private sector-regarding their views about the OGD initiative in Tanzania. Our findings show that the OGD initiative in Tanzania is in an emerging stage and there are barriers (organizational, social, legal, and technical) toward instituting a robust OGD initiative in the country. Further, we find that there is inertia among the government departments in terms of publishing data sets. Our findings provide a sounding board for further research on the sustainability of OGD initiatives in Tanzania and the other African countries, by and large.

AB The digital transformation of local government brings about massive change in IT leadership. As the strategic designer and process developer for government data sharing, the Chief Information Officer (CIO) needs to build self-centered leadership systems with strong coordination capabilities and adaptable mechanisms. Through a qualitative multi-case comparative study of three provinces in China, we applied IS innovation ecosystem theory to construct a CIO-centric local government data-sharing leadership ecosystem. The competencies, behaviors, and mechanisms of leadership roles are analyzed in five dimensions (personal, interpersonal, organizational, inter-organizational, and socio-economic and generation). Results show that a CIO-centric local government data sharing ecosystem can be resilient to administrative structure change, facilitating data sharing across levels, regions, and departments through collaborative networks and rotation approach. It provides useful insights into similar practices for constructing data sharing leadership ecosystem in local government, and can bring public value to citizens.

AB This paper analyses the implementation of the Open Government Data strategy and portal of the City of Vienna. This evaluation is based on qualitative interviews and online polls after the strategy was implemented. Two groups of users were involved in the evaluation: internal target groups (employees and heads of department in the City of Vienna's public administration departments) and external stakeholders (citizens, business representatives, science and research, journalists). Analyzed aspects included the present organizational processes, the benefits (to business and society), and requirements for future Open Government Data initiatives. This evaluation reveals success factors which accompanied the implementation: the clear definition of responsibilities and the implementation along a process model, the integration of the Open Government Data platform into existing Content Management Systems, the evaluation of the Open Government Data initiative very shortly after its inception. Based on the theoretical and empirical findings, recommendations for future Open Government Data strategies are made which target the local authority and would require action on the federal level such as Creative Commons Attribution License as the default for subsidy funds or public relation measures carried out directly by the data providing departments.

AB Background Nearly half of US adults with diagnosed hypertension have uncontrolled blood pressure. Clinical inertia may contribute, including patient-physician uncertainty about how variability in blood pressures impacts overall control. Better information display may support clinician-patient hypertension decision making through reduced cognitive load and improved situational awareness. Methods A multidisciplinary team employed iterative user-centered design to create a blood pressure visualization EHR prototype that included patient-generated blood pressure data. An attitude and behavior survey and 10 focus groups with patients (N = 16) and physicians (N = 24) guided iterative design and confirmation phases. Thematic analysis of qualitative data yielded insights into patient and physician needs for hypertension management. Results Most patients indicated measuring home blood pressure, only half share data with physicians. When receiving home blood pressure data, 88% of physicians indicated entering gestalt averages as text into clinical notes. Qualitative findings suggest that including a data visualization that included home blood pressures brought this valued data into physician workflow and decision-making processes. Data visualization helps both patients and physicians to have a fuller understanding of the blood pressure 'story' and ultimately promotes the activated engaged patient and prepared proactive physician central to the Chronic Care Model. Both patients and physicians expressed concerns about workflow for entering and using home blood pressure data for clinical care. Conclusions Our user-centered design process with physicians and patients produced a well-received blood pressure visualization prototype that includes home blood pressures and addresses patient-physician information needs. Next steps include evaluating a recent EHR visualization implementation, designing annotation functions aligned with users' needs, and addressing additional stakeholders' needs (nurses, care managers, caregivers). This significant innovation has potential to improve quality of care for hypertension through better patient-physician understanding of control and goals. It also has the potential to enable remote monitoring of patient blood pressure, a newly reimbursed activity, and is a strong addition to telehealth efforts.

AB Large-scale events are becoming more frequent in contemporary cities, increasing the need for novel methods and tools that can provide relevant stakeholders with quantitative and qualitative insights about attendees' characteristics. In this work, we investigate how social media can be used to provide such insights. First, we screen a set of factors that characterize crowd behavior and introduce a set of proxies derived from social media data. We characterize the crowd in two city-scale events, Sail 2015 and King's Day 2016, analyzing several properties of their attendees, including demographics, city-role, crowd temporal distribution, social media post locations, Point of Interest (PoI.) preferences, and word use. We show that it is possible to characterize crowds in city-scale events using social media data, thus paving the way for new real-time applications on crowd monitoring and management for city-scale events.

AB Poor provision of information and communication technologies in low/middle-income countries represents a concern for promoting open data. This is often framed as a 'digital divide' and addressed through initiatives that increase the availability of information and communication technologies to researchers based in low-resourced environments, as well as the amount of resources freely accessible online. Using qualitative empirical data from a study of lab-based research in Africa we highlight the limitations of this framing and emphasize the range of additional factors necessary to effectively utilize data available online. We adapt Sen's 'capabilities approach' to highlight the distinction between simply making resources available, and fostering researchers' ability to use them. This provides an alternative orientation that highlights the persistence of deep inequalities within the seemingly egalitarian-inspired open data landscape. We propose that the extent and manner of future data sharing will hinge on the ability to respond to the heterogeneity of research environments.

   Relationships in Informal Open-Ended Data Exploration
SO JOURNAL OF THE LEARNING SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
AB Engaging learners with complex unfamiliar datasets is a known challenge in Data Science education. One promising phenomenon investigated in related work is perspective-taking. A first-person "actor" perspective can help facilitate group and individual sensemaking by mediating observations and actions taken by learners. Here we investigate how museum visitors made use of an actor perspective when exploring an open-ended, interactive data map museum exhibit. We use a mix of qualitative and quantitative empirical methods to explore how actor perspective-taking (APT) may mediate joint sensemaking around data visualizations. By applying interpretive coding to 54 conversations wherein APT naturalistically emerged, we identify 3 distinct self-to-data relationships constructed via APT: role-play, projection, and orientation. A further analysis explores how APT was embedded in joint sensemaking of the visualized data. Twelve APT-mediated sensemaking processes are identified; two (extrapolating and noticing absence) were used in conjunction with multiple APT self-to-data relationships, while the remaining ten (e.g., enacting, spatially characterizing, generalizing) were exclusively used with specific self-to-data APT relationships. We use these empirical findings to generate hypotheses about how APT and associated sensemaking processes may support Data Science learning goals.

AB Traces of learning behaviors generally provide insights into learners and the learning processes that they employ. In this article, a learning-analytics-based approach is proposed for managing cognitive load by adjusting the instructional strategies used in online courses. The technology-based learning environment examined in this study involved a video conferencing system and learning management system (LMS) for hosting course content and discussion forums. The social networking software Line was used to enhance the social presence of learners. Students (N = 869) enrolled in a summer course participated in a 9-week experiment. Their LMS log data and social media footprints were recorded, and content experts assessed the intrinsic cognitive load (ICL) of each content module through a consensus process. A learning analytics method was applied to identify candidate parameters relating learning behaviors to cognitive load. The instructor assessed the learners' cognitive processes and adjusted the instructional strategies according to the results of statistical, discourse, and qualitative analyses. Practical guidelines related to various cognitive load effects were designed to assist the students with managing their cognitive load by using learning behaviors and analytics data as signals for making a change in learning processes. Teachers of online courses can use the proposed approach as a support tool to identify learning problems and assist learners with maintaining a cognitive load that is conducive to learning.

AB This paper assesses the data management of digitized Indigenous knowledge systems (IKS) in IKS repositories in South Africa. The study adopted a qualitative research method. The multiple case study research design was adopted to collect data from eight respondents in four Indigenous Knowledge Systems Documentation Centres (IKSDCs) in repositories spread across three provinces in South Africa. The findings revealed that the Department of Science and Technology (DST) coordinates the national IKS programmes under the National Recordal System (NRS) and they are responsible for the management of digitized IKS. The findings also revealed that although the National Indigenous Knowledge Management System (NIKMAS) was built for the management of the data, the system is still in its planning phase, and work is still in progress. In addition, it was discovered that information professionals like archivists and records managers are currently not involved in the management of IKS data in the repositories. The paper offers recommendations on the data management and storage of IKS, data description, mitigating the challenges, and some measures to help ensure the authenticity of the IKS data collected in the repositories.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the relationship between big data and knowledge management (KM).
   Design/methodology/approach - The study adopts a qualitative research methodology and a case study approach was followed by conducting nine semi-structured interviews with open-ended and probing questions.
   Findings - Useful predictive knowledge can be generated through big data to help companies improve their KM capability and make effective decisions. Moreover, combination of tacit knowledge of relevant staff with explicit knowledge obtained from big data improvises the decision-making ability.
   Research limitations/implications - The focus of the study was on oil and gas sector, and, thus, the research results may lack generalizability.
   Originality/value - This paper fulfills an identified need of exploring the relationship between big data and KM which has not been discussed much in the literature.

DE Data use; Equity; Accountability
ID TEACHERS; ABILITY
AB Ensuring equitable opportunities and outcomes for all students is a top priority of many educators and policymakers across the globe. Data use can be an important lever for achieving equity, but how this can occur is not well understood. In this article, we draw upon knowledge gained in a decade of in-depth qualitative research to examine the ways in which data use helps to open or close doors for students. We discuss data use practices that influence equity goals: (1) accountability-driven data use and data use for continuous improvement; (2) using data to confirm assumptions and using data to challenge beliefs, and (3) tracking and flexible grouping to promote student growth. Along each of these dimensions, there are active decision makers, complex processes of data use at play, and a great deal of variation both within and across contexts. Ultimately, educators and policymakers are faced with critical choices regarding data use that can profoundly affect students' daily educational experiences and trajectories.

AB Introduction: The rapidly expanding direct-to-consumer genetic testing (DTC GT) market is one area where narratives of underrepresented populations have not been explored extensively. This study describes African-American consumers' personal experiences with and perceptions about DTC GT and explores similarities and differences between African-Americans and an earlier cohort of mostly European American consumers. Methods: Twenty semi-structured, qualitative interviews were held with individuals who self-identified as Black/African-American and completed DTC GT between February 2017 and February 2020. Interviews were transcribed and consensus-coded, using inductive content analysis. Results: Participants generally had positive regard for DTC GT. When considering secondary uses of their results or samples, most participants were aware this was a possibility but had little concrete knowledge about company practices. When prompted about potential uses, participants were generally comfortable with research uses but had mixed outlooks on other nonresearch uses such as law enforcement, cloning, and product development. Most participants expressed that consent should be required for any secondary use, with the option to opt out. The most common suggestion for companies was to improve transparency. Compared to European American participants, African-American participants expressed more trust in DTC GT companies compared to healthcare providers, more concerns about law enforcement uses of data, and a stronger expression of community considerations. Discussion/Conclusion: This study found that African-American consumers of DTC GT had a positive outlook about genetic testing and were open to research and some nonresearch uses, provided that they were able to give informed consent. Participants in this study had little knowledge of company practices regarding secondary uses. Compared to an earlier cohort of European American participants, African-American participants expressed more concerns about medical and law enforcement communities' use of data and more reference to community engagement.

AB Path-breaking in theory and practice alike, digital humanities (DH) not only secures a larger public audience for humanities and social sciences research, but also permits researchers to ask novel questions and to revisit familiar ones. Public-funded, international, and collaborative research in DH furthers institutional research missions and enriches networked knowledge. The Digging into Data 3 challenge (DID3) (2014-2016), an international and interdisciplinary grant initiative embracing big data, included 14 teams sponsored by 10 funders from four nations. A qualitative case study that relies on purposive sampling and grounded analysis, this article centers on the information practices of DID3 participants. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 53 participants on 11 of the 14 DID3 projects. The study explores how Data Management Plan requirements affect work practices in public-funded DH, how scholars grapple with key data management challenges, and how they plan to reuse and share their data. It concludes with three recommendations and three directions for future research.

AB A number of countries are today implementing open government data (OGD) initiatives. Yet many of these initiatives are failing to attract the levels of continuous use they need to deliver an acceptable return on investment. This raises the obvious question of why this should be the case. To answer this question, it is important to understand the factors that most strongly influence user behaviour in OGD adoption. Qualitative data were used to identify the factors that play a key role in influencing the intention to engage with ODG. A quantitative approach was then used to evaluate the extent to which these factors drive/limit behaviour. The study's findings showed that there are four factors that play a significant role in intention to use OGD. It is also believed that the findings will be useful in helping policymakers in all jurisdictions formulate and implement strategies that successfully drive up continuous OGD engagement.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore how big data can shape ambidextrous business process management (BPM) in terms of exploitation and exploration.
   Design/methodology/approach A qualitative methodology involving case studies has been chosen to explore the impact of big data deployment on exploitative and explorative business processes.
   Findings The results of case studies offer some opportunities and challenges for service firms related to both the exploitative and the explorative aspects of BPM driven by big data.
   Originality/value The deployment of big data in business processes has attracted a large amount of interest recently. However, these studies are mostly conceptual, so empirical research about this complex relationship is quite rare, especially research with specific arguments regarding exploitative and explorative activities. This paper aims to fill this gap by offering empirical evidence for big data-driven business processes.

AB Market segmentation comprises a variety of measurement methodologies that are used to support management, marketing and promotional policies in tourism destinations. This study applies ClustOfVar, a relatively recent algorithm for cluster analysis from mixed variables. The technique finds groups of variables by using a homogeneity criterion based on the sum of correlation-ratios for qualitative variables, and squared correlations for quantitative variables. Then principal components from each cluster of variables are extracted in order to segment cruise passengers. CART analysis is finally used for the sake of finding the variables that drove the formation of the clusters. All the analysis is based on an official survey of tourists who disembarked in Uruguayan ports. The analysis identified five clusters, both for variables and cruise passengers. Findings highlight the importance of the enjoyment of the contact with local people for the economic impact, as well as the important role of age and gender related variables. Managerial implications are also discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We identify the advantages of reusing vocabularies from the Web and discuss how and to what extent the disadvantages can be overcome. The study is performed at the Print Room of the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam, where currently a large collection of prints, photographs and drawings is being catalogued. We report on the analysis of the current practice of professional cataloguers, the iterative design of an annotation tool and a qualitative evaluation of this tool with a user experiment in a realistic annotation environment.

TI Identifying organizational capacities and incentives for clinical
   data-sharing: The case of a regional perinatal information system
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION
LA English
DT Article
AB The development of regional data-sharing among healthcare organizations is viewed as an important step in the development of health information technology (HIT), but little is known about this complex task. This is a case study of a regional perinatal data system that involved four hospitals, together responsible for over 10,000 births annually. Using standard qualitative methods, we chronicled project milestones, and identified 31 "critical incidents" that delayed or prevented their achievement. We then used these critical incidents to articulate six organizational capacity domains associated with the achievement of project milestones, and a seventh domain consisting of organizational incentives. Finally, we analyzed the relationship of milestone achievement to the presence of these capacities and incentives. This data center case suggests four requirements for sharing data across organizations: 1) a readiness assessment; 2) a perceived mandate; 3) a formal governance structure; and 4) a third party IT component.

AB Research shows that effective teaching behavior is important for students' learning and outcomes, and scholars have developed various instruments for measuring effective teaching behavior do-mains. Although student assessments are frequently used for evaluating teaching behavior, they are mainly in Likert-scale or categorical forms, which precludes students from freely expressing their perceptions of teaching. Drawing on an open-ended questionnaire from large-scale student surveys, this study uses a machine learning tool aiming to extract teaching behavior topics from large-scale students' open-ended answers and to test the convergent validity of the outcomes by comparing them with theory-driven manual coding outcomes based on expert judgments. We applied a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling analysis, together with a visualization tool (LDAvis), to qualitative data collected from 173,858 secondary education students in the Netherlands. This data-driven machine learning analysis yielded eight topics of teaching behavior domains: Clear explanation, Student-centered supportive learning climate, Lesson variety, Likable characteristics of the teacher, Evoking interest, Monitoring understanding, Inclusiveness and equity, Lesson objectives and formative assessment. In addition, we subjected 864 randomly selected student responses from the same dataset to manual coding, and performed theory-driven content analysis, which resulted in nine teaching behavior domains and 19 sub-domains. Results suggest that the relation between machine learning and human analysis is complementary. By comparing the bottom-up (machine learning analysis) and top-down (content analysis), we found that the pro-posed topic modeling approach reveals unique domains of teaching behavior, and confirmed the validity of the topic modeling outcomes evident from the overlapping topics.

ID RELIABILITY
AB The Wikipedia category system was designed to enable browsing and navigation of Wikipedia. It is also a useful resource for knowledge organisation and document indexing, especially using automatic approaches. However, it has received little attention as a resource for manual indexing. In this article, a hierarchical taxonomy of three-level depth is extracted from the Wikipedia category system. The resulting taxonomy is explored as a lightweight alternative to expert-created knowledge organisation systems (e.g. library classification systems) for the manual labelling of open-domain text corpora. Combining quantitative and qualitative data from a crowd-based text labelling study, the validity of the taxonomy is tested and the results quantified in terms of interrater agreement. While the usefulness of the Wikipedia category system for automatic document indexing is documented in the pertinent literature, our results suggest that at least the taxonomy we derived from it is not a valid instrument for manual subject matter labelling of open-domain text corpora.

AB Open research data represent an opportunity to share scientific knowledge and to provide new perspectives for validation and dissemination of scientific results. Effective re-use of these data implies to know both the research methods applied to obtain them and the measures of usage and citation that are sistematically gathered. Based on the whole catalogue of open research data (348 datasets) from SciELO journals available in Figshare, this study aims to explore their research methods and the types of data according to data collection techniques and subject categories. It also analyses usage and bibliometric indicators, file formats and dataset licensing. Results show that quantitative data are more frequent than qualitative data. The most usual data were those obtained by observation techniques, followed by experimental and derived data. This figures varied according to the different scientific areas, but usage indicators came out not to be significant for the whole set of data files.

AB Background: Electronic prescribing (EP) and electronic hospital pharmacy (EHP) systems are increasingly common. A potential benefit is the extensive data in these systems that could be used to support antimicrobial stewardship, but there is little information on how such data are currently used to support the quality and safety of antimicrobial use.
   Objectives: To summarize the literature on secondary use of data (SuD) from EP and EHP systems to support quality and safety of antimicrobial use, to describe any barriers to secondary use and to make recommendations for future work in this field.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic search within four databases; we included original research studies that were (1) based on SuD from hospital EP or EHP systems and (2) reported outcomes relating to quality and/or safety of antimicrobial use and/or qualitative findings relating to SuD in this context.
   Results: Ninety-four full-text articles were obtained; 14 met our inclusion criteria. Only two described interventions based on SuD; seven described SuD to evaluate other antimicrobial stewardship interventions and five described descriptive or exploratory studies of potential applications of SuD. Types of data used were quantitative antibiotic usage data (n = 9 studies), dose administration data (n = 4) and user log data from an electronic dashboard (n = 1). Barriers included data access, data accuracy and completeness, and complexity when using data from multiple systems or hospital sites.
   Conclusions: The literature suggests that SuD from EP and EHP systems is potentially useful to support or evaluate antimicrobial stewardship activities; greater system functionality would help to realize these benefits.

AB In the literature, several frameworks have been proposed to help sustainability management in supply chains. Nevertheless, they present a number of shortcomings. With the aim of overcoming these shortcomings, this paper proposes a framework for sustainable supply chain management composed of six dimensions: methodology, organization, stakeholders, maturity model, human resources, and technology. The main innovations of the framework are that (1) it includes a methodology that acts as a guide to sustainability management and improvement in a holistic way by using a balanced scorecard for any type of supply chain and covering the whole project life cycle; (2) it combines quantitative and qualitative methods for sustainability assessment; (3) it describes the techniques and technology to be used in each task of the methodology; and (4) it identifies the past impact of SC sustainability, as well as predicting its future impact, using Big Data analytics. The practical utility, completeness, and level of detail of the framework were validated through questionnaires answered by both five academics and three professionals. In addition, the framework was applied to a case study to (1) validate its usefulness and (2) to improve it with the feedback obtained.

AB Increased global sharing of public health research data has potential to advance scientific progress but may present challenges to the interests of research stakeholders, particularly in low-to-middle income countries. Policies for data sharing should be responsive to public views, but there is little evidence of the systematic study of these from low-income countries. This qualitative study explored views on fair data-sharing processes among 60 stakeholders in Kenya with varying research experience, using a deliberative approach. Stakeholders' attitudes were informed by perceptions of benefit and concerns for research data sharing, including risks of stigmatization, loss of privacy, and undermining scientific careers and validity, reported in detail elsewhere. In this article, we discuss institutional trust-building processes seen as central to perceptions of fairness in sharing research data in this setting, including forms of community involvement, individual prior awareness and agreement to data sharing, independence and accountability of governance mechanisms, and operating under a national framework.

AB Teaching effectiveness is a core issue in educational research; however, there is little consensus about the most important results of classroom teaching from an international perspective. The effectiveness of teaching has remained a 'black box' for a long time. In the secondary study described in this paper we used empirical data for Shanghai taken from the international Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) study Global Teaching InSights (GTI)-initially the Teaching and Learning International Survey (TALIS) Video Study-which was based on videotaped direct observations of classroom teaching. Eighty-five junior high school mathematics teachers and their students in Shanghai were observed to explore the impact of specific teaching practices on students' interest, self-efficacy, and mathematics achievement scores. The results revealed that social-emotional support and instruction quality were the key dimensions relating to the characteristics and differences of mathematics lessons in Shanghai. While the former had a significantly positive impact on students' general mathematics self-efficacy, the latter had a significantly positive impact on students' mathematics interest. Although specific teaching practices had no significant direct impact on students' mathematics achievement scores, social-emotional support and instruction quality considerably influenced students' academic performance in an indirect way via general self-efficacy.

AB Higher education instructors constantly rely on educational data to assess and evaluate the behavior of their students and to make informed decisions such as which content to focus on and how to best engage the students with it. Massive open online course (MOOC) platforms may assist in the data-driven instructional process, as they enable access to a wide range of educational data that is gathered automatically and continuously. Successful implementation of a data-driven instruction initiative depends highly on the support and acceptance of the instructors. Yet, our understanding of instructors' perspectives regarding the process of data-driven instruction, especially with reference to MOOC teaching, is still limited. Hence, this study was set to characterize MOOC instructors' interest in educational data and their perceived barriers to data use for decision-making. Taking a qualitative approach, data were collected via semi-structured interviews with higher education MOOC instructors from four public universities in Israel. Findings indicated that the instructors showed great interest mostly in data about social interactions between learners and about problems with the MOOC educational resources. The main reported barriers for using educational data for decision-making were lack of customized data, real-time access, data literacy, and institutional support. The results highlight the need to provide MOOC instructors with professional development opportunities for the proper use of educational data for skilled decision-making.

AB Central values of science are, among others, transparency, verifiability, replicability, and openness. The currently very prominent Open Science (OS) movement supports these values. Among its most important principles are open methodology (comprehensive and useful documentation of methods and materials used), open access to published research output, and open data (making collected data available for re-analyses). We here present a survey conducted among members of the German Psychological Society (N = 337), in which we applied a mixed-methods approach (quantitative and qualitative data) to assess attitudes toward OS in general and toward data sharing more specifically. Attitudes toward OS were distinguished into positive expectations ("hopes") and negative expectations ("fears"). These were uncorrelated. There were generally more hopes associated with OS and data sharing than fears. Both hopes and fears were highest among early career researchers and lowest among professors. The analysis of the open answers revealed that generally positive attitudes toward data sharing (especially sharing of data related to a published article) are somewhat diminished by cost/benefit considerations. The results are discussed with respect to individual researchers' behavior and with respect to structural changes in the research system.

AB The abundance of South African clinical and public health research data has the potential to unlock important and valuable future advances in biomedical science. Amid increasing calls for more effective sharing of individual-level data, commitment to promote access to research data is evident within South Africa's public research sector, but national guidance and regulation are absent. This qualitative study examined the perceptions, experiences and concerns of 32 research stakeholders about data-sharing practices. There was consensus about the utility of data sharing in publicly funded health research. However, disparate views emerged about the possible harms and benefits of sharing data and how these should be weighed. The relative dearth of policies governing data-sharing practices needs to be addressed and a framework of support developed that incentivizes data-sharing practices for researchers that are both ethical and effective.

ID SCALE; QUEENSLAND; ECONOMICS
AB Current decision-making in natural resource use and management aims at delivering ecologically-sustainable development to achieve conservation and economic benefits. The process of guiding natural resource use requires the integration of social, economic and biophysical information on which to base management decisions. This paper discusses the integration of socio-economic information for natural resource management (NRM) planning and decision-making in the Australian context. A comprehensive resource of socio-economic data is the Census, which is undertaken every five years by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) for the whole of Australia. Unfortunately there are qualitative and quantitative issues stemming from the use of ABS census data maps for NRM decision-making, as they are at a different scale to and the boundaries do not coincide with biophysical information. These issues include the variable shape of collection districts, the use of enumerated data for population-based statistics, the large size of collection districts in low populated areas, and the averaging of socio-economic information over the collection districts. Examples highlight these issues and show a way forwards in improving data integration, which includes simple spatial overlay methods and regression modelling.

AB This study contributes to the literature by assessing data-driven sustainable supply chain management performance in a hierarchical structure under uncertainties. Sustainable supply chain management has played a significant role in the general discussion of business management. While many attributes have been addressed in prior studies, there remains no convincing evidence that big data analytics improve the decision-making process regarding sustainable supply chain management performance. This study proposes applying exploratory factor analysis to scrutinize the validity and reliability of the proposed measures and uses qualitative information, quantitative data and social media applied fuzzy synthetic method-decision making trial and evaluation laboratory methods to identify the driving and dependence factors of data-driven sustainable supply chain management performance. The results show that social development has the most significant effect. The results also indicate that long-term relationships, a lack of sustainable knowledge or technology, reverse logistic, product recovery techniques, logistical integration, and joint development are the most effective criteria for enhancing sustainable supply chain management performance. The theoretical and managerial implications are discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Firms are often reluctant to share data because of mistrust, concerns over control, and other risks. Multi-party computation (MPC) is a new technique to compute meaningful insights without having to transfer data. This paper investigates if MPC affects known antecedents for data sharing decisions: control, trust, and risks. Through 23 qualitative interviews in the automotive industry, we find that MPC (1) enables new ways of technology-based control, (2) reduces the need for interorganizational trust, and (3) prevents losing competitive advantage due to data leakage. However, MPC also creates the need to trust technology and introduces new risks of data misuse. These impacts arise if firms perceive benefits from sharing data, have high organizational readiness, and perceive data as non-sensitive. Our findings show that known antecedents of data sharing should be specified differently with MPC in place. Furthermore, we suggest reframing MPC as a data collaboration technology beyond enhancing privacy.

AB Aims To test whether two critical design features, inclusion criteria of required pre-trial abstinence and pre-trial alcohol use disorder (AUD) diagnosis, predict the likelihood of detecting treatment effects in AUD pharmacotherapy trials. Methods This secondary data analysis used data collected from a literature review to identify randomized controlled pharmacotherapy trials for AUD. Treatment outcomes were selected into abstinence and no heavy drinking. Target effect sizes were calculated for each outcome and a meta-regression was conducted to test the effects of required pre-trial abstinence, required pre-trial AUD diagnosis, and their interaction on effect sizes. A sub-analysis was conducted on trials, which included FDA-approved medications for AUD. Results In total, 118 studies testing 19 medications representing 21,032 treated participants were included in the meta-regression analysis. There was no significant effect of either predictor on abstinence or no heavy drinking outcomes in the full analysis or in the sub-study of FDA-approved medications. Conclusion By examining these design features in a quantitative, rather than qualitative, fashion the present study advances the literature and shows that requiring AUD diagnosis or requiring pre-trial abstinence do not impact the likelihood of a significant medication effect in the trial.
   Short Summary: A secondary meta-regression of 118 randomized controlled trials of alcohol use disorder pharmacotherapies was conducted to test if design features predict the likelihood of detecting treatment effects. There was no significant effect of either pre-trial abstinence or pre-trial AUD diagnosis requirements on abstinence or heavy drinking outcomes.

AB Conclusions of research articles depend on bodies of data that cannot be included in articles themselves. To share this data is important for reasons of both transparency and reuse. Science, Technology, and Medicine journals have a role in facilitating sharing, but by what mechanism is not yet clear. The Journal Research Data (JoRD) Project was a JISC (Joint Information Systems Committee)-funded feasibility study on the potential for a central service on journal research data policies. The objectives of the study included identifying the current state of journal data sharing policies and investigating stakeholders' views and practices. The project confirmed that a large percentage of journals have no data sharing policy and that there are inconsistencies between those that are traceable. This state leaves authors unsure of whether they should share article related data and where and how to deposit those data. In the absence of a consolidated infrastructure to share data easily, a model journal data sharing policy was developed by comparing quantitative information from analyzing existing journal data policies with qualitative data collected from stakeholders. This article summarizes and outlines the process by which the model was developed and presents the model journal data sharing policy.

AB Health promotion is a complex activity that requires analytic methods that recognize the contested nature of it definition, the barriers and supports for such activities, and its embeddedness within the politics of distribution. In this commentary I critique a recent study of municipalities' implementation of the Norwegian Public Health Act that employed analysis of "yes" or "no" responses from a large survey. I suggest the complexity of health promotion activities can be best captured through qualitative methods employing open-ended questions and thematic analysis of responses. To illustrate the limitations of the study, I provide details of how these methods were employed to study local public health unit (PHU) activity promoting health equity in Ontario, Canada.

AB During the last few years, government institutions and agencies around the world have been adopting Open Government Data (OGD) initiatives to achieve political, social, economic, cultural and institutional benefits. This study aims to investigate the motivational factors for adopting OGD among government institutions in Saudi Arabia. A qualitative research approach was used to guide the research and the data was collected using interviews and documentation. The results of the study are interpreted and explained using elements from institutional theory. It shows that the adoption of OGD is influenced by existing institutional arrangements, and that the institutional changes that are occurring in the country such as the Saudi Vision 2030, the approval of the Freedom of information Act 2016, and anti-corruption campaigns have contributed positively to the transition from culture of secrecy to openness. In addition; the initiative is influenced by internal and external institutional pressures. Furthermore, the organizations studied perceived several benefits, which can be described as rationalized myths of the OGD such as transparency and accountability, better access to government data, support for innovation, improved government services, operational benefits and encouragement of participation. Based on the findings, the study provides some theoretical and practical implications regarding OGD adoption in government sittings.

AB Purpose - This paper reports on a critical literature review, which aimed to identify, understand and qualify barriers that hinder the release of open government data (OGD) in China. Moreover, the purpose of this paper is to develop and propose a theoretical framework, which can be adopted as a basis for empirical investigation in the future, and to articulate mitigating strategies.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study adopted an inductive qualitative approach, retrieving 42 academic articles from three main Chinese academic databases: CNKI, Wanfang and CQVIP. A thematic analysis approach was employed for the literature analysis.
   Findings - The literature analysis pointed to 15 barriers to the release of OGD in China. Furthermore, the barriers emerged in the following three main themes: institutional barriers, data integrity and quality barriers, and user participation barriers.
   Originality/value - This paper reports on one of the early research efforts into the problems of releasing OGD in China. Although this study focusses on Chinese context and issues, the findings and lessons learnt can be shared across international borders.

AB During the coronavirus pandemic, changes in the way science is done and shared occurred, which motivates meta-research to help understand science communication in crises and improve its effectiveness. The objective is to study how many Spanish scientific papers on COVID-19 published during 2020 share their research data. Qualitative and descriptive study applying nine attributes: (a) availability, (b) accessibility, (c) format, (d) licensing, (e) linkage, (f) funding, (g) editorial policy, (h) content, and (i) statistics. We analyzed 1,340 papers, 1,173 (87.5%) did not have research data. A total of 12.5% share their research data of which 2.1% share their data in repositories, 5% share their data through a simple request, 0.2% do not have permission to share their data, and 5.2% share their data as supplementary material. There is a small percentage that shares their research data; however, it demonstrates the researchers' poor knowledge on how to properly share their research data and their lack of knowledge on what is research data.

AB Increased sensing and data collection in electric power systems from utility to minigrid to individual household scale are resulting in an explosion of data collection about users and providers of electricity services. In the push to expand energy access for poor communities, the collection, use, and curation of these data have historically taken a back seat to the goal of expanding energy access but are increasingly being recognized as important issues. We review the nascent literature on this topic, characterize current data management practices, and examine how expanding access to data and data sharing are likely to provide value and pose risks to key stakeholders: end users of electricity, microutilities, macroutilities, governments, development institutions, and researchers. We identify the key opportunities and tensions and provide recommendations for the design and implementation of new data-sharing practices and platforms. Our review and analysis suggest that although a common and open platform for sharing technical data can mitigate risks and enable efficiency, fewer benefits are likely to be realized from sharing detailed financial data. We also recommend codesigning practices with each stakeholder group, increasing legal protections for end users of electricity and using deep qualitative data in addition to quantitative metrics.

AB The study investigates and provides results on the current status of research data management at a medical school in a developing African country. The study focusses on four aspects of research data management generation; preservation and backup; competencies; and challenges. Quantitative data collected using a questionnaire from 84 health researchers and 16 librarians was complemented by qualitative data gathered through conducting structured interviews with the Director of Research of the university. The study results provide the research community with a better understanding of research data management perspectives amongst health researchers in a developing country. This could help research data management stakeholders to adopt better strategies for championing research data management activities in this particular country and in other developing countries. The study notes that the current research data management status creates an opportunity for an academic library to consolidate and fortify its widely viewed natural role in research data management. In view of the findings, the study proposes that the adoption of research data management policies is essential in inspiring the conceptualisation, popularisation, adoption, and operationalisation of various research data management activities within the African university environment.

AB Data-sharing is a desired default in the field of public health and a source of much ethical deliberation. Sharing data potentially contributes the largest, most efficient source of scientific data, but is fraught with contextual challenges which make stakeholders, particularly those in under-resourced contexts hesitant or slow to share. Relatively little empirical research has engaged stakeholders in discussing the issue. This study sought to explore relevant experiences, contextual, and subjective explanations around the topic to provide a rich and detailed presentation of what it means to different stakeholders and contexts to share data and how that can guide practice and ethical guidance. A qualitative design involving interviews was undertaken with professionals working in public health institutions endowed with data (HDSS), ethics committees, and advisory agencies which help shape health research in Africa. A descriptive form of thematic analysis was used to summarize results into six key themes: (1) The role of HDSSs in research using public health data and data-sharing; (2) Ownership and funding are critical factors influencing data-sharing; (3) Other factors discourage data-sharing; (4) Promoting and sustaining data-sharing; (5) Ethical guidance structures; and (6) Establishing effective guidance. The themes reveal factors regarding the willingness or not to share and an intricate ethical system that current discourse could reflect. Many of the concerns resonate with the literature, but a whole other gamut of people and process issues; commitments, investments, careers, and the right ethical guidance are needed to realize a sustainable goal of reaching 'share' as a default.

AB Purpose Prior studies identified a need for further comparison of data-sharing practices across different disciplines and communities. Toward addressing this need, the purpose of this paper is to examine the data-sharing practices of the earthquake engineering (EE) community, which could help inform data-sharing policies in EE and provide different stakeholders of the EE community with suggestions regarding data management and curation. Design/methodology/approach This study conducted qualitative semi-structured interviews with 16 EE researchers to gain an understanding of which data might be shared, with whom, under what conditions and why; and their perceptions of data ownership. Findings This study identified 29 data-sharing factors categorized into five groups. Requirements from funding agencies and academic genealogy were frequent impacts on EE researchers' data-sharing practices. EE researchers were uncertain of data ownership and their perceptions varied. Originality/value Based on the findings, this study provides funding agencies, research institutions, data repositories and other stakeholders of the EE community with suggestions, such as allowing researchers to adjust the timeframe they can withhold data based on project size and the amount of experimental data generated; expanding the types and states of data required to share; defining data ownership in grant requirements; integrating data sharing and curation into curriculum; and collaborating with library and information schools for curriculum development.

AB The current process of social transformation is driven by the growth of the culture of transparency and accountability, the socio-technological development of the web and the opening of public data. This situation forces the media to rethink their models of social intermediation, converting the growing open data access and user participation into new instruments that facilitate citizen empowerment. Open data can only generate citizen empowerment, facilitate decision-making and democratic action if it can provide value-added information to the citizens. Therefore, the aim of the research is to analyse the competencies necessary to develop information products created with open data. The study used a qualitative methodology based on two instruments: a survey of data journalism experts (university professors of journalism, journalism professional data, and experts in transparency), and an analysis of selected cases of information products created with open data. The results allow the identification of a series of conceptual, procedural and attitudinal skills needed to perform the tasks of collection, processing, analysis and presentation of data, which are necessary for the development of this type of information product, and which should be integrated into the training of future journalists.

ID FEATURE-SELECTION
AB In this paper, application of the rough set theory (RST) to feature selection in customer relationship management (CRM) is introduced. Compared to other methods, the RST approach has the advantage of combining both qualitative and quantitative information in the decision analysis, which is extremely important for CRM. Automated decision support for CRM has been proposed in recent years. However, little work has been devoted to the development of computer-based systems to support CRM in rule induction. This paper presents a novel rough set based algorithm for automated decision support for CRM. Particularly, the approach is capable to handle real numbers instead of integer numbers through introduction of converted numbers involving tolerances. Being unique and useful in solving CRM problems, an alternative rule extraction algorithm (AREA) is presented for discovering preference-based rules according to the reducts which contain the maximum of strength index (SI) in the same case, where the data with tolerance. The empirical data set associated with CRM has proven the validity and reliability of these approaches. This research thus contributes to developing and validating a useful approach to automated decision support for CRM. This paper forms the basis for solving many other similar problems that occur in the service industry. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID BIG DATA ANALYTICS; TECHNOLOGIES; ADOPTION
AB To answer the call for more evidence on the adoption and effectiveness of Big Data Analytics in auditing, this study investigates auditors' use of data analytic tools in audit-process management, including audit planning, testing, and conclusions. The analysis, which is performed as a qualitative study, is based on twenty-eight semi-structured interviews with Big 4 and non-Big 4 audit professionals in Thailand to gain insights into their experience implementing audit data analytic tools in the initial stage. Findings suggest that auditors primarily use data analytic tools in audit planning and substantive testing. Nevertheless, auditors do not perceive a need to use these tools to test internal controls and conclude audit opinions. In addition, we find that auditors tend to apply audit data analytic tools for anomaly detection and testing management assertions. Overall, auditors perceive the benefits of audit data analytic tools in improving their audit process management. Findings present practical implications for audit firms and audit professionals, including how to initially implement data analytic tools effectively in auditing and as guidelines for regulators on how to develop auditing standards that govern the use of Big Data and data analytic tools. We note some limitations in this study, such as the generalizability of the results, auditors' personal biases, and the different tools and techniques used by each audit firm.

ID HEALTH WORKFORCE; CARE
AB Facing severe under-funding and significant workforce maldistribution, the health system in Romania is challenged to provide adequate care for the ageing population. The aim of this article is to connect health labour market data of the geriatrics workforce in Romania with individual perceptions of front-line workers in geriatrics in order to better understand the 'human' factors of effective health workforce development. Comprehensive health workforce data are not available; we therefore used a rapid scoping review and interviews to combine quantitative and qualitative data sources, such as the 'Healthcare Facility Activity Report', policy documents and available reports. They show that despite a consistent increase in the overall number of geriatricians, their majority is based in Bucharest, the capital city. The initial review points to possible geriatrician burnout, caused in part by high workload. The geriatrics workforce in Romania is poorly developed. Significant efforts are still needed to create policies addressing inflows and outflows, training, maldistribution and inefficiencies related to their practice. Addressing burnout by improving teamwork and collaboration is vital for maintaining and improving the workforce morale and motivation. Two major policy recommendations emerged: an urgent need for better health workforce data in Romania and development of more effective workforce management.

DT Article
ID OPENNESS; SERVICE; ISSUES; NEEDS
AB Research Data Management (RDM) promises to make research outputs more transparent, findable, and reproducible. Strategies to streamline data management across disciplines are of key importance. This paper presents results of an institutional survey (N = 258) at a medium-sized Austrian university with a STEM focus, supplemented with interviews (N = 18), to give an overview of the state-of-play of RDM practices across faculties and disciplinary contexts. RDM services are on the rise but remain somewhat behind leading countries like the Netherlands and UK, showing only the beginnings of a culture attuned to RDM. There is considerable variation between faculties and institutes with respect to data amounts, complexity of data sets, data collection and analysis, and data archiving. Data sharing practices within fields tend to be inconsistent. RDM is predominantly regarded as an administrative task, to the detriment of considerations of good research practice. Problems with RDM fall in two categories: Generic problems transcend specific research interests, infrastructures, and departments while discipline-specific problems need a more targeted approach. The paper extends the state-of-the-art on RDM practices by combining in-depth qualitative material with quantified, detailed data about RDM practices and needs. The findings should be of interest to any comparable research institution with a similar agenda.

ID INTERNET; SUSTAINABILITY; SCIENCE
AB This study aimed to investigate the underlying business model of organizations that have data sharing at the core of their activities. Previous work has stressed that data-sharing projects need to be sustainable in the long term, and highlighted the need for a deeper understanding of the operation model of existing data-sharing initiatives. To investigate this important issue, we took a qualitative approach to uncover the dynamics of value creation in data sharing. Using a case study method, we examined two data-sharing sites across different areas. We conducted semistructured interviews with managers from data centers and other stakeholders, and reviewed documents about the technical and managerial practices to determine the main characteristics of their business models. In addition, we applied the e3-value modeling methodology to tease out the value flows within each site. Our findings demonstrated the importance of the value network dimension of a business model, as data sharing relies on a set of actors creating and getting value in the process, and the significance of intangible assets. The main contributions of this study include extending current understanding on data-sharing business models by analyzing key dimensions, and uncovering how value is created and transferred in data sharing.

AB This paper develops tests and validates a model for the antecedents of open source software (OSS) defects, using Data and Text Mining. The public archives of OSS projects are used to access historical data on over 5,000 active and mature OSS projects. Using domain knowledge and exploratory analysis, a wide range of variables is identified from the process, product, resource, and end-user characteristics of a project to ensure that the model is robust and considers all aspects of the system. Multiple Data Mining techniques are used to refine the model and data is enriched by the use of Text Mining for knowledge discovery from qualitative information. The study demonstrates the suitability of Data Mining and Text Mining for model building. Results indicate that project type, end-user activity, process quality, team size and project popularity have a significant impact on the defect density of operational OSS projects. Since many organizations, both for profit and not for profit, are beginning to use Open Source Software as an economic alternative to commercial software, these results can be used in the process of deciding what software can be reasonably maintained by an organization.

AB This study provides insights into the evolution and conceptual framework of research data management (RDM). It also investigates the role of libraries and librarians in offering data management services and the challenges they face in this regard. The study is qualitative in nature and based on an extensive literature review survey. The analysis of the reviewed literature reveals that the idea of RDM has emerged as a new addition to library research support services. The more recent literature clearly established the pivotal role of libraries and librarians in developing and managing RDM services. However, data sharing practices and the development of RDM services in libraries are more prevalent in developed countries. While these trends are still lacking among researchers and libraries in developing countries. Creating awareness among researchers about the benefits of data sharing is a challenging task for libraries. Furthermore, institutional commitment, collaboration, academic engagement, technological infrastructure development, lack of policies, funding, and storage, skills, and competencies required for librarians to offer RDM-based services are some of the other significant challenges highlighted in the literature. Certainly, RDM services are difficult and complicated; therefore, librarians need to master the skills of research data to offer library-based RDM services.

AB In recent years, more and more government administrations around the world are participating in open data policy implementation. Government officials who are charged with implementing this new policy usually need to look for related information for deciding what datasets to open to the public. Accordingly, a research gap exists in understanding government officials? information behaviors in implementing open data policy. By using a qualitative approach to conduct semi-structured interviews with government officials who have extensive experience in implementing open data policy, this study explores government officials? information behaviors in searching and selecting datasets for open data publication. Specifically, this research investigates government officials? information needs, the employed information sources, and the intervening variables that influence their information behaviors. While open data is an ongoing policy implementation, government officials? information behaviors form an iterative cycle where information needs continually occur, information seeking activities are conducted by using a variety of information sources, and the obtained information is used to satisfy information needs. The findings and discussions of this study are expected to provide insights of government officials? data search and selection to practitioners and to enrich the current literature of open government data.

AB Background and Objective: Both health care providers and payers recognize the need to improve chronic disease care. Chronic disease management relies on high-quality health information for people with, and at risk of developing, chronic diseases. This article focuses on the health insurance sector and investigates ways that payment claims data and other data sources can provide useful information to support chronic disease management interventions. Methods and Results: In this mixed methods study, we first examine methods of selecting target populations from insurance claims data for common chronic conditions-diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and mental health disorders. The analysis of claims data reveals data quality issues and indicates that other data sources should be considered to provide additional information. We undertake a qualitative review of factors influencing the development of information systems for chronic disease management that use multiple data sources. Conclusions: Claims data should be supplemented with other data to inform chronic disease management. The article proposes a conceptual framework with four domains that need to be considered when developing chronic disease information systems using multiple data sources-information requirements, data sources, data collection, and information systems integration. There are policy and organizational factors that influence framework implementation.

AB Recent advances in technology have made truly open and accessible government significantly more realisable. One of the ways in which governments are using this technology is in the implementation of online portals that allow open (i.e., public and unrestricted) access to data and use of data. Such portals can be used by citizens and professionals to facilitate improved decision-making across a wide range of areas, from car-parking to promoting entrepreneurialism. However, the existence of portals per se is not enough. To maximise their potential, users must also feel that they are both accessible and usable. To gain insights into the current state of usability of OGD portals for professionals working in data-related areas, a comparative study of the portals of the G7 group was carried out, using a mixed methodology. This is the first specific comparison of these portals for such users, as well as the first study to add a user-centred qualitative dimension to the research. The study's findings showed that the G7 countries are not maximising the potential of their portals or collaborating effectively. Addressing these issues, and building better cross-national consistency, would help to improve the value delivered by investment in OGD portals. The study also further supported an existing user-centred, heuristic evaluation framework for application to a more specific user group, as well as more generally.

TI Statistical data: The underestimated tool for higher education
   management - The case of Makerere University
SO HIGHER EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID DATA QUALITY; FACULTY
AB Institutions of higher learning in developing countries in general and sub-Saharan Africa in particular have continued to underestimate the crucial role data plays in the management process. They have failed to fully appreciate data as any other resources such as students and staff. The paper identifies the strengths and weaknesses of the existing data for higher education management with special reference to Makerere University. While the University had massive data on students, useability of such data in the management process was questionable. The data was characterised by several weaknesses. These included: inconsistencies in the terms used, incompleteness, rampant data duplication, and lack of continuity of some data elements; lending its useability questionable. Generally, the University concentrated on the collection of quantitative data and little emphasis put on qualitative data. Consequently, making the link between educational input, process and output not only difficult but also impossible.
   Overall University data system ranging from data collection designs and methods to utilisation was unsatisfactory. This was partly attributed to inadequate appreciation of the role of information in management by the university management, inadequate incentives, and poor coordination between the reporting units. Clearly, the existing data within the University were inadequate for effective management. Corrective measures to improve the information within the University are explored and new data suggested.

ID KNOWLEDGE; METADATA
AB Purpose Taking the researchers' perspective, the purpose of this paper is to examine the types of context information needed to preserve data's meaning in ways that support data reuse. Design/methodology/approach This paper is based on a qualitative study of 105 researchers from three disciplinary communities: quantitative social science, archaeology and zoology. The study focused on researchers' most recent data reuse experience, particularly what they needed when deciding whether to reuse data. Findings Findings show that researchers mentioned 12 types of context information across three broad categories: data production information (data collection, specimen and artifact, data producer, data analysis, missing data, and research objectives); repository information (provenance, reputation and history, curation and digitization); and data reuse information (prior reuse, advice on reuse and terms of use). Originality/value This paper extends digital curation conversations to include the preservation of context as well as content to facilitate data reuse. When compared to prior research, findings show that there is some generalizability with respect to the types of context needed across different disciplines and data sharing and reuse environments. It also introduces several new context types. Relying on the perspective of researchers offers a more nuanced view that shows the importance of the different context types for each discipline and the ways disciplinary members thought about them. Both data producers and curators can benefit from knowing what to capture and manage during data collection and deposit into a repository.

AB The data team intervention was designed to support Dutch secondary schools in using data while developing a solution to an educational problem. A data team can build school-wide capacity for data use through knowledge sharing among data team members, and knowledge brokerage between the team and other colleagues. The goal of this mixed-methods study is to understand how knowledge sharing and brokerage regarding data use and an educational problem changed over time. Social network data were collected twice at eight schools. These data were used to analyse (1) how well team members were connected with each other (density), (2) whether team members' relationships were mutual (reciprocity) and (3) whether all team members were equally important for the data team network (centralisation). Moreover, different types of knowledge brokering (inward, outward and forward) were examined to further understand knowledge exchange between data team members and their colleagues. Qualitative data were analysed to triangulate these findings for four particular cases. Among other things, findings illustrated that while knowledge sharing and knowledge brokerage both changed over time, there were considerable differences between teams in the extent and direction of change. It appeared that the dissemination of knowledge within the organisation requires more explicit attention.

AB To solve problems related to urban land development, protection, and management, urban planners focus on achieving high precision and currency for fine-grained semantic recognition of urban functional zones (UFZs). The classification of discrete functional zones and qualitative recognition of UFZs have been well studied, but the precise recognition of UFZs with explicit depictions of socioeconomic urban functions has seldom been addressed. Thus, we propose a novel open-source data-guided semantic urban function recognition (OSD-SFR) framework to analyze UFZs and quantitatively link open-source data (OSD) with the Chinese national urban function classification code. The spatial relationship between the combined semantic database and the segmented urban zones data set was measured, graded, and categorized. Kernel density and statistical methods based on a single data source of points-of interest were used for comparative experiments. The results indicate that OSD-SFR yields more fine-grained delineations between urban functions and achieves more accurate recognition. Critical semantic information from different OSD sources is deeply integrated. This study provides a realistic reference, including detailed descriptions of the spatial distribution and morphological structure of UFZs, to support long-term city planning.

AB Evidence-based practice (EBP) offers school librarians a systematic process for developing, assessing, and revising their school library programs. Two of the seven steps in this process involve collecting and sharing meaningful evidence with appropriate stakeholders, often for advocacy purposes, strategically selecting communication channels and methods aligned with target audiences. Through a survey collecting both quantitative and qualitative data, 161 school librarians in Kentucky, Virginia, and Texas shared their experiences with evidence-based practice. The study reported here focuses on school librarians' evidence collection and sharing practices. Findings indicate school librarians collect easily obtainable data and share evidence of practice widely; however, they are most likely to share with building-level administrators, and the channels through which they communicate with school personnel differ from those chosen to communicate with other stakeholder groups. Approximately half of participants share evidence for advocacy purposes, and only slightly more than half share evidence of their practice with other school librarians.

ID INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE
AB Introduction: Health research is gradually embracing a more collectivist approach, fueled by a new movement of open science, data sharing and collaborative partnerships. However, the existence of systemic contradictions hinders the sharing of health data and such collectivist endeavor. Therefore, this qualitative study explores these systemic barriers to a fair sharing of health data from the perspectives of Swiss stakeholders.
   Methods: Purposive and snowball sampling were used to recruit 48 experts active in the Swiss healthcare domain, from the research/policy-making field and those having a high position in a health data enterprise (e.g., health register, hospital IT data infrastructure or a national health data initiative). Semi-structured interviews were then conducted, audio-recorded, verbatim transcribed with identifying information removed to guarantee the anonymity of participants. A theoretical thematic analysis was then carried out to identify themes and subthemes related to the topic of systemic fairness for sharing health data.
   Results: Two themes related to the topic of systemic fairness for sharing health data were identified, namely (i) the hypercompetitive environment and (ii) the legal uncertainty blocking data sharing. The theme, hypercompetitive environment was further divided into two subthemes, (i) systemic contradictions to fair data sharing and the (ii) need of fair systemic attribution mechanisms.
   Discussion: From the perspectives of Swiss stakeholders, hypercompetition in the Swiss academic system is hindering the sharing of health data for secondary research purposes, with the downside effect of influencing researchers to embrace individualism for career opportunities, thereby opposing the data sharing movement. In addition, there was a perceived sense of legal uncertainty from legislations governing the sharing of health data, which adds unreasonable burdens on individual researchers, who are often unequipped to deal with such facets of their data sharing activities.

AB Effective public policies are needed to manage a nation's natural resources, including soil and water. However, making such policies currently requires a shift from a traditional qualitative approach to a mix of scientific data, evidence and the relevant social elements, termed data-driven policymaking. Nigeria, like most developing countries, falls short of the framework for this approach. Nevertheless, the lack of potable water in some regions and the continuous degradation of farmable lands call for intervention through effective policy formulation and implementation. In this work, we present a conceptual workflow as a strategic step towards developing a framework for a data-driven soil and water resources management policy. A review of the current legal and policy framework and selected scientific literature on soil and water resources in Nigeria is presented. Analysis of the National Water Resources Bill proposed in 2018 is used to highlight existing gaps between policy, scientific data and reality. Modern field techniques and project-based examples for soil and aquifer characterization that can be adapted for local use are presented. While government must take responsibility for the poor policy framework, the research community is challenged on the need for scientific data as a base for effective policy formulation and implementation.

AB Universal health coverage (UHC) aims to ensure people have access to the health services they need. Sixteen tracer indicators were developed for implementation by countries to measure UHC in the health system. South Africa uses 15 of the proposed 16 indicators. Operational managers in the public health care sector collect data and report on these indicators at a primary health clinic level. This qualitative study explored the knowledge and attitudes of managers toward data and UHC service indicators in a sub-district in Ugu, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Operational managers saw data collection as information gathering, measuring performance and driving action. They understood UHC indicators as 'health for all' linking them to National Department of Health Strategic plans and saw the value of indicators for health promotion. They found the lack of training, inadequate numeracy skills, requests for data from multiple spheres of government and the indicator targets that they had to reach as challenging and untenable. While operational managers made the link between data, measuring performance and action, the limited training, skills gaps and pressures from higher levels of government may impede their ability to use data for local level planning and decision making.

ID ARCHIVED QUALITATIVE DATA
AB Researchers' responsibilities towards their research data are changing across all domains of social scientific endeavour. Government, funders and publishers expect greater transparency of, open access to, and re-use of research data, and fears over data loss call for more robust information security practices. Researchers must develop, enhance and professionalise their research data management skills to meet these challenges and to deal with a rapidly changing data sharing environment. This paper sets out how we have contributed to jump-starting the research methods training curriculum in this field by translating high-level needs into practical guidance and training activities. Our pedagogical approach involves applicable, easy-to-digest, modules based on best practice guidance for managing and sharing research data. In line with recent findings on successful practices in methods teaching, we work on the principle of embedding grounded learning activities within existing narratives of research design and implementation.

AB In the defence industry the recent development of a 'market for technology', the creation of new European high-technology companies as well as transformations in government agencies have driven firms to reposition their technological and organizational skills. Our objective is to show that the transformations that have occurred in the past 10 years have not only redefined skills and the organization of production, but also have given a more strategic place to knowledge management (KM) practices. We provide a contextual and historical overview based on qualitative interviews, in order to better understand the relation between KM and innovative behaviour in this industry. We build an original industrial and technological database comprising various samples that provides quantitative information concerning KM and innovative practices. The results of the statistical analysis reveal the specificity of firms in this industry. Taking account of the size of these firms and their technological intensity, we show that the behaviour of defence industry firms in terms of KM practices, differs from that of other firms. This is evident from their technological performance, and innovation and patenting intensity. This structural tendency is explained as an innovative behaviour in the French national innovation system rather than merely a 'trend'. Crown Copyright (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Purpose This study seeks to understand the current state of the development of linked open data (LOD) bibliographic portals to discuss their functionalities, contributions, value-adds and user experience. Design/methodology/approach A set of evaluative aspects grouped into three analysis dimensions was established: collections, tools-technologies and standards used-and web user interface. As the object of the study, four projects of diverse nature and volume were selected to help provide a better understanding of the trends in the solutions provided for the end user when accessing linked data collections. Findings Publishing LOD through visual interfaces maximises information enrichment, contextualisation and discovery, in addition to improving user experience, because of both increased navigation capabilities and interrelationships between data. These more flexible environments have metamorphosised the visualisation of bibliographic information. However, aspects that needed improvement were observed, primarily relating to (1) a more intuitive interaction, (2) possibilities of greater personalisation, (3) enhanced communication with the user to favour user engagement and (4) experimental spaces of data reuse. Research limitations/implications Further quantitative and qualitative studies should be conducted to improve these portals, assess their adaptation to the behaviour of the user and their influence on the use of library collections. Originality/value This article investigates the potential of semantic technologies in bibliographic data portals, proposes a methodological model for their evaluation and advances conclusions about the usability and user experience that these platforms provide, compared to classic catalogues.

ID DATA ANALYTICS; CHALLENGES
AB Big Data courses in which students are asked to carry out Big Data projects are becoming more frequent as a part of University Engineering curriculum. In these courses, instructors and students must face a series of special characteristics, difficulties and challenges that it is important to know about beforehand, so the lecturer can better plan the subject and manage the teaching methods in order to prevent students'academic dropout and low performance. The goal of this research is to approach this problem by sharing the lessons learned in the process of teaching e-learning courses where students are required to develop a Big Data project as a part of a final degree/master course. In order to do so, a survey was carried out among a group of students enrolled in those kinds of courses during the last years. The quantitative and qualitative analysis of the obtained data led us to present a series of lessons learned that may help other participants (both students and lecturers) to better study, design and teach similar courses. In addition, the results shed light on possible existing open problems in the area of Big Data project development. Both the methodology used and the survey designed in this research were validated by a group of experts in the area using a formal statistical approach at a significance level of p<0.008, which support the validity of the lessons learned.

AB Public administrations publish open data for later reuse by citizens. Besides the obvious impact on transparency, they have an important economic potential which explains the increasing adoption of this type of initiatives. There is an increasing number of administrations that decide to create open data portals, a tendency that municipalities have followed. Few empirical papers have assessed this type of portals and the analyses have been mainly qualitative or limited to a reduced number of portals, so there are no generally accepted criteria for the assessment of their implementation. The main contribution of this paper is the definition of a method to analyse open data portals and its application to a sample of municipalities of Spain, a country at the forefront of data re-utilization in Europe. Furthermore, the economic-financial information available in these portals is analysed, as it is essential to accountability, fight corruption and evaluate the financial sustainability and effectiveness of public service delivery. Results show that there is much room for improvement in this field. Only 40% of the cities analysed have an open data portal, and the average score of the sample analysed does not reach 50%. Most portals seem to work as mere data repositories, neglecting those aspects that promote data use by the non-expert public, accountability, citizen engagement and the quality of the data being disclosed (e.g., definition of the metadata used). So, the paper concludes with some recommendations for improvement.

AB Policy processes to open digital forest data and information are driven by expectations of increased effectiveness and efficiency of forest management, greater transparency of forest decision making, development of new innovations, and transition to bioeconomy. We investigate how interlinkages between the governance of forest information and governance of forests are being reshaped in the formation of new institutions for open data and information in the case of Finland, where the Forest Information Act was revised in 2016-2018. A qualitative content analysis of public statements related to the legal reform was conducted to understand the perceived benefits and risks associated with more open forest data and information by different actors, and how those perceptions shape their views on appropriate governance of forest information. The analysis reveals conflicts between right to information and right to privacy; concerns about data format, access and usability; as well as the interests of actors with entrenched positions in Finnish forest governance. The debate on opening forest information reflects tensions related to a transition towards greater openness and diversity of values in the forest sector. We envision further research on the relationship between the governance of forests and governance of forest information to support informed decision making during the current open data boom.

AB Once-daily oral tenofovir/emtricitabine is highly effective as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) against HIV but is dependent on adherence, which may be challenging for men who have sex with men (MSM) and use substances. Digital pill systems (DPS) permit the direct, real-time measurement of adherence, though user perceptions of data privacy in this context are unknown. Thirty prospective DPS users - HIV-negative MSM with non-alcohol substance use - completed in-depth qualitative interviews exploring preferences around privacy, access, and sharing of DPS adherence data. Participants discussed some concerns about the impact of DPS use on personal privacy, and emphasized the need for robust data protections in the technology. Participants were interested in having on-demand access to their adherence data, and were most willing to share data with primary care providers and long-term relationship partners. Future investigations exploring bioethical frameworks around DPS use are warranted, and user preferences should inform best practices for protecting DPS data.

AB Purpose This paper presents results of a study on data managers' perspectives on the evolution of Designated Communities and the FAIR Principles using an example of a geological repository. Design/methodology/approach The study employed 10 semi-structured interviews with data managers at a state geological survey and qualitative analysis of the interview transcripts. Findings The Designated Community for a collection in this data repository has evolved from petroleum industry users to include academic researchers and the public. This change was accompanied by significant user interaction changes from in-person, reference interview-style conversations to anonymous digital, automated interactions. The main factors driving these changes were developments in technology which allowed the data managers to shift data discovery and access into the online environment. The online data portal has seen increasing non-expert use, driving the data team to develop additional services for these new communities. Repository data team participants varied in their familiarity with the FAIR Principles and their perceptions of the FAIRness of the data in the repository. Research limitations/implications The study was limited to one organization in the United States. However, the results are applicable to other data environments working through the tensions between high-level global frameworks such as FAIR, and continuing to serve the day-to-day needs of their designated communities. Continued work on how to assess success in this complex space is needed. Originality/value This paper lies at the nexus of two digital preservation frameworks and contributes to a limited extant literature providing guidance on implementing the concept of a Designated Community in practice.

AB This paper studies the impact of management policies on the diffusion of data warehouse (DW) in a large commercial bank in Thailand. A system dynamics (SD)-based decision support system (DSS) is developed and analysed for this purpose. System dynamics was used as the modelling tool because of its rigorous approach in capturing interrelationships among variables and in handling dynamic aspects of the system behaviour. A qualitative model is first formulated to understand the present state of the DW diffusion. The quantitative model is then formulated to simulate seven management policies. Findings unearth two dominant policies of 'increase level of training' and 'decrease training delay' that will speed up the diffusion significantly. None of the policies, however, achieve the bank's target diffusion level within a specified time period. Sensitivity analyses reveal various combinations of the dominant policies that the management can adopt. The analyses act as an eye-opener for the bank executives as they understand what can be feasibly achieved given a number of constraints. With easy interfaces and supportive tools, bank executives can use the DSS to test various scenarios, which will enhance their learning process and improve their decision making.

TI Relationship between women's decision-making power over their own health
   care and use of modern contraception in the Democratic Republic of the
   Congo: a cross-sectional secondary data analysis
SO BMC WOMENS HEALTH
LA English
DT Article

   health survey; Health care; Modern contraception; Reproductive health
ID EPIDEMIOLOGY; AUTONOMY
AB Background In sub-Saharan Africa, the use of modern contraception (MC) is a critical intervention aimed at reducing mortality rates associated with unintended, high-risk pregnancies. However, among Congolese women aged 15-49, the prevalence of MC use is low. Research suggests that women's general participation in decision-making is important in increasing MC use. However, little is known about the specific role of women's decision-making power over their own health care and how it relates to MC use. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the relationship between women's decision-making power over their own health care and use of MC. Methods A cross-sectional secondary data analysis was conducted using the most recent data from the 2013-2014 Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) Demographic and Health Survey. Women who were considered in need of contraception based on their family planning preferences were included in the study population (N = 6422). Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine whether women's decision-making power over their own health care was associated with the use of MC. Results Only one in ten women reported using a modern method of contraception. Logistic regression showed that women who made decisions alone regarding their own health care were more likely to use MC than women who had no say in these decisions, even after controlling for important covariates (OR 1.48; 95% CI 1.00, 2.17). Conclusion The results of this study lend further support that promoting women's autonomy and right to independently make decisions regarding their own health may be important in increasing the use of MC in the DRC. However, in order to effectively empower women to negotiate for the use of MC, qualitative research is needed to further assess the relationship between decision-making power and MC use.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to analyse current challenges and to articulate the preconditions for data-driven, fact-based product portfolio management (PPM) based on commercial and technical product structures, critical business processes, corporate business IT and company data assets. Here, data assets were classified from a PPM perspective in terms of (product/customer/supplier) master data, transaction data and Internet of Things data. The study also addresses the supporting role of corporate-level data governance. Design/methodology/approach The study combines a literature review and qualitative analysis of empirical data collected from eight international companies of varying size. Findings Companies' current inability to analyse products effectively based on existing data is surprising. The present findings identify a number of preconditions for data-driven, fact-based PPM, including mutual understanding of company products (to establish a consistent commercial and technical product structure), product classification as strategic, supportive or non-strategic (to link commercial and technical product structures with product strategy) and a holistic, corporate-level data model for adjusting the company's business IT (to support product portfolio visualisation). Originality/value The study contributes to the existing literature by specifying the preconditions for data-driven, fact-based PPM as a basis for product-level analysis and decision making, emphasising the role of company data assets and clarifying the links between business processes, information systems and data assets for PPM.

AB Background: The relevant legislation ensures confidentiality and has paved the way for data handling and sharing. However, the industry remains uncertain regarding big data handling and sharing practices for improved healthcare delivery and medical research. Methods: A semi-qualitative cross-sectional study was used which entailed analysing miners' personal health records from 2014 to 2018. Data were accessed from the audiometry medical surveillance database (n = 480), the hearing screening database (n = 24,321), and the occupational hygiene database (n = 15,769). Ethical principles were applied to demonstrate big data protection and sharing. Results: Some audiometry screening and occupational hygiene records were incomplete and/or inaccurate (N = 4675). The database containing medical disease and treatment records could not be accessed. Ethical challenges included a lack of clarity regarding permission rights when sharing big data, and no policy governing the divulgence of miners' personal and medical records for research. Conclusion: This case study illustrates how research can be effectively, although not maliciously, obstructed by the strict protection of employee medical data. Clearly communicated company policies should be developed for the sharing of workers' records in the mining industry to improve HCPs.

AB The type, the nature, and the amount of information at the disposal of tourists have exploded, overwhelming them with the number of choices and making trip planning a very challenging task. Recommender systems offer personalized recommendations and help individuals overcome this information overload. The deployment of such systems in the hotel industry needs to satisfy specific constraints making the direct application of classical approaches insufficient. Travelers recurrently fall into the cold-start status due to the volatility of interest and the change in attitudes depending on the context. Events have been playing an essential role in drawing attention to specific regions and constitute a major motive to organize trips. In this paper, we explore for the first time the benefits of introducing open data related to events into hotel recommender systems. We address in particular two problems, the hotel-centric and the event-centric problems, where we recommend pairs of hotels and events in order to facilitate the tourism planning and enhance the travelers' experience. We first collect data related to events and filter those susceptible of attracting people. We then develop a novel framework that infers events' affinities based on hotel booking data and rely on the mass behavior to make personalized suggestions. Finally, we demonstrate our framework by performing a qualitative and a quantitative evaluation. Improvements in the quality of recommendation show the advantage of leveraging event data for hotel recommendation and illustrate the opportunities of using open data for tourism planning.

AB Open government data (OGD) has attracted widespread attention and has been widely carried out on a global scale. With further promotion, OGD performance becomes a hot topic and meaningful enough for in-depth exploration. This research focuses on the influential factors and generation mechanisms of OGD performance. Based on the resource-based theory and institutional theory, this paper constructs a model from multiple dimensions of internal resources and external pressures. Subsequently, from the 122 cities in China that have constructed OGD platforms, this study adopts a mixed research methods approach, which combines the regression analysis method and qualitative comparative analysis (QCA). The regression analysis results show that the organization arrangement, legal and policy, and horizontal pressure have direct positive effects on OGD performance. On this basis, this paper use QCA method to explore the configuration paths for the generation of OGD performance of cities in different geographic regions and at different administrative ranks levels. The QCA results provide different configuration paths to achieve better OGD performance, which verified the conclusions drawn by the regression analysis, also provides alternative paths for governments with different characteristics. This paper enriches the studies on OGD performance and provides more targeted paths together with references for the implementation of OGD.

AB Operational risks are increasingly prevalent and complex to manage in organisations, culminating in substantial financial and non-financial costs. Given the inefficiencies and biases of traditional manual, static and qualitative risk management practices, research has progressed to using data analytics to objectively and dynamically manage risks. However, the variety of operational risks, techniques and objectives researched is not well mapped across industries. This paper thoroughly reviews the emerging research area applying data analytics to operational risk management (ORM) within financial services (FS) and energy and natural resources (ENR). A systematic literature search resulted in 2,538 publications, from which detailed bibliometric and content analyses are performed on 191 studies of relevance. The literature is classified using a novel multi-layered framework, informing critical analyses of the analytics techniques and data employed. Five core themes emerge, relevant to practitioners, researchers, educators and students across any sector: risk identification, causal factors, risk quantification, risk prediction and risk decision-making. Generally, ENR studies focus on identifying causal factors and predicting specific incidents, whereas FS applications are more mature surrounding risk quantification. To conclude, the comprehensive review reveals areas where further research is needed to advance ORM within and beyond FS and ENR, in pursuit of improved decision-making.

   REPRESENTATION
AB Numerous studies have demonstrated that regularly playing action video games (AVGPs) is associated with increased cognitive performance. Individuals who play role-playing video games (RPGs) have usually been excluded from these studies. This is because RPGs traditionally contained no action components and were thus not expected to influence cognitive performance. However, modern RPGs increasingly include numerous action-like components. We therefore examined whether current RPG players (RPGPs) perform similar to action video game players (AVGPs) or nonvideo game players (NVGPs) on two cognitive tasks. Self-identified AVGPs (N = 76), NVGPs (N = 77), and RPGPs (N = 23) completed two online cognitive tasks: A useful field of view (UFOV) task and a multiple-object tracking task (MOT). The UFOV task measures the ability to deploy visuospatial attention over a large field of view while dividing one's attention between a central and a peripheral task. The MOT task measures the ability to use attentional control to dynamically refresh information in working memory. RPGPs performed similar to AVGPs and better than NVGPs on both tasks. However, patterns of covariation (e.g., gender and age) presented obstacles to interpretation in some cases. Our study is the first to demonstrate that RPGPs show similar cognitive performance to AVGPs. These findings suggest that regularly playing modern RPGs may enhance visuospatial abilities. However, because the current study was purely cross-sectional, intervention studies will be needed to assess causation. We discuss the implications of this finding, as well as considerations for how gamers are classified going forward.
   Public Policy Relevance Statement
   We investigate whether individuals who play action video games that are mostly first- or third-person shooter games, as well as individuals who play action role-playing games, differ in their cognitive abilities as compared with nonvideo game players. We demonstrate that both action and role-playing gamers outperform nongamers on two attentionally demanding tasks and perform similarly to each other, suggesting that games other than those traditionally placed in the "action" genre may be beneficial for cognitive performance.

AB This article proposes an optical measurement of movement applied to data from video recordings of facial expressions of emotion. The approach offers a way to capture motion adapted from the film industry in which markers placed on the skin of the face can be tracked with a pattern-matching algorithm. The method records and postprocesses raw facial movement data (coordinates per frame) of distinctly placed markers and is intended for use in facial expression research (e.g., microexpressions) in laboratory settings. Due to the explicit use of specifically placed, artificial markers, the procedure offers the simultaneous measurement of several emotionally relevant markers in a (psychometrically) objective and artifact-free way, even for facial regions without natural landmarks (e.g., the cheeks). In addition, the proposed procedure is fully based on open-source software and is transparent at every step of data processing. Two worked examples demonstrate the practicability of the proposed procedure: In Study 1(N=39), the participants were instructed to show the emotions happiness, sadness, disgust, and anger, and in Study 2 (N=113), they were asked to present both a neutral face and the emotions happiness, disgust, and fear. Study 2 involved the simultaneous tracking of 14 markers for approximately 12 min per participant with a time resolution of 33 ms. The measured facial movements corresponded closely to the assumptions of established measurement instruments (EMFACS, FACSAID, Friesen & Ekman, 1983; Ekman & Hager, 2002). In addition, the measurement was found to be very precise with sub-second, sub-pixel, and sub-millimeter accuracy.

AB This study analyzes how users perceive the risks associated with privacy loss on social networks and behave in response to these perceived risks. Specifically, it studies how privacy literacy influences privacy-related risk perceptions concerning the usage of personal information on social networks, and the relationship between the user's privacy concerns and their sharing behavior on social media. The privacy paradox concept is evaluated in this context with respect to the ambiguous values and perceptions that social network users have, wherein they experience concerns regarding their privacy in specific environments but continue to share their information and personal content via these channels regardless. The research adopts a qualitative exploratory approach using semi-structured interviews and content analysis, with Facebook as the focal social network. Four categorical headlines are identified, supporting specific findings that indicate that risk perceptions concerning privacy do impact users' privacy concerns, but do not influence individuals to reduce sharing data. Thus, although some users perceive risks involved in these practices, they continue to share data, ignoring the fact that this may be to their detriment and instead focusing on characteristics that support their sharing. The findings indicate that social interaction benefits obtained from social, hedonic and utilitarian elements provided via the social network lead users to take risks regarding online self-exposure based on their desires and social values.

ID SYNCHRONY
AB Researchers in the fields of sign language and gesture studies frequently present their participants with video stimuli showing actors performing linguistic signs or co-speech gestures. Up to now, such video stimuli have been mostly controlled only for some of the technical aspects of the video material (e.g., duration of clips, encoding, framerate, etc.), leaving open the possibility that systematic differences in video stimulus materials may be concealed in the actual motion properties of the actor's movements. Computer vision methods such as OpenPose enable the fitting of body-pose models to the consecutive frames of a video clip and thereby make it possible to recover the movements performed by the actor in a particular video clip without the use of a point-based or markerless motion-tracking system during recording. The OpenPoseR package provides a straightforward and reproducible way of working with these body-pose model data extracted from video clips using OpenPose, allowing researchers in the fields of sign language and gesture studies to quantify the amount of motion (velocity and acceleration) pertaining only to the movements performed by the actor in a video clip. These quantitative measures can be used for controlling differences in the movements of an actor in stimulus video clips or, for example, between different conditions of an experiment. In addition, the package also provides a set of functions for generating plots for data visualization, as well as an easy-to-use way of automatically extracting metadata (e.g., duration, framerate, etc.) from large sets of video files.

ID INFORMED-CONSENT; BROAD CONSENT
AB The ability to exchange samples and data is crucial for the rapidly growth of biobanking. However, sharing is based on the assumption that the donor has given consent to a given use of her or his simple. Biobanking stakeholders, therefore, must choose 1 of 3 options: obtain general consent enabling multiple future uses before taking a sample from the donor, try to obtain consent again before sharing a previously obtained sample, or look for a legally endorsed way to share a sample without the donor's consent. In this study, we present the results of 36 semistructured qualitative interviews with Swiss biobanking stakeholders regarding these options and the role of ethics committees in the process of authorizing sharing. Our results show that despite a lack of legal or guideline-based barriers to general consent, some stakeholders and ethics committees have reservations about this method of consent. In most cases, however, a general consent form is already in use. Many interviewees describe processes involving the ethics committees as time-consuming and cumbersome and their requirements as too demanding for donors/patients. Greater awareness of donors' opinions and preferences and the content of guidelines and recommendations could therefore be helpful for a better justified perspective of biobanking stakeholders and ethical committee members, equally. Finally, it may be necessary to differentiate between procedures governing future samples, where general consent is clearly desirable, and the use of old yet still relevant samples, where the option of using them without consent can be highly beneficial for research.

AB How do children understand the privacy implications of the contemporary digital environment? This question is pressing as technologies transform children's lives into data which is recorded, tracked, aggregated, analysed and monetized. This article takes a child-centred, qualitative approach to charting the nature and limits of children's understanding of privacy in digital contexts. We conducted focus group interviews with 169 UK children aged 11-16 to explore their understanding of privacy in three distinct digital contexts-interpersonal, institutional and commercial. We find, first, that children primarily conceptualize privacy in relation to interpersonal contexts, conceiving of personal information as something they have agency and control over as regards deciding when and with whom to share it, even if they do not always exercise such control. This leads them to some misapprehensions about how personal data is collected, inferred and used by organizations, be these public institutions such as their schools or commercial businesses. Children's expectation of agency in interpersonal contexts, and their tendency to trust familiar institutions such as their schools, make for a doubly problematic orientation towards data and privacy online in commercial contexts, leading to a mix of frustration, misapprehension and risk. We argue that, since the complexity of the digital environment challenges teachers' capacity to address children's knowledge gaps, businesses, educators, parents and the state must exercise a shared responsibility to create a legible, transparent and privacy-respecting digital environment in which children can exercise genuine choice and agency.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to map the service quality (SQ) of Airbnb, to provide additional insight for such top player of short-stay accommodation in the sharing economy context. Design/methodology/approach A mixed-method approach is used in two phases. In the qualitative phase, 112,138 online review comments of Airbnb guests were analyzed to generate the service attributes. In the quantitative phase, an online survey (n= 814) was conducted to calculate the performance and importance values of extracted attributes to plot them in an Importance-Performance Analysis (IPA) matrix. Findings A holistic image of the Airbnb extracted service attributes was presented through the IPA plot. Four types of SQ strategies were proposed, considering the actions priority. "Price reasonability" was the most important service attribute of Airbnb for guests, whereas "Check-in flexibility" was the best performed one. Practical implications The results shed light on the most relevant SQ attributes of Airbnb and proposed suitable strategies that can prioritize relevant stakeholders' actions and decisions. The study significantly contributes to all decision makers involved in the short-stay accommodation sharing industry to further understand and develop SQ. Originality/value This research, using a comprehensive hybrid method, opens a lens to see more clearly the positioning of different attributes of Airbnb service from importance and performance viewpoints. As a contribution, the SQ of Airbnb was mapped by conducting an IPA for the first time in the literature.

AB Background: The integrity of behavioral intervention trials depends on consistent intervention delivery, and uniform, comprehensive process data collection. It can be challenging in practice due to complex human interactions involved.
   Objective: We sought to design a system to support the fidelity of intervention delivery and efficient capture of qualitative and quantitative process data for a telephone-delivered behavioral counseling intervention to increase physical activity and function after total knee replacement surgery.
   Methods: A tailored system was designed to prompt the intervention coach in the delivery of a 5 step counseling protocol to support intervention fidelity across patients. System features included structured data components, automated data exchange functions, user-friendly data capture screens, and real-time surveillance reporting. The system structured the capture of patient goals and open-ended conversation.
   Results: The system recorded intervention process data from each of 12 sessions held with the 92 intervention patients. During the trial, 992 telephone sessions were conducted, and more than 97% (4816/4960) of intervention process data fields were completed in the system. The coach spent 5-10 minutes preparing for each counseling call using system-generated summaries of historical data and 10-15 minutes entering intervention process data following each telephone session.
   Conclusions: This intervention delivery system successfully supported the delivery of a structured behavioral counseling intervention and collection of intervention process data. It addressed the unique needs of clinical behavioral intervention trials, and had promising potential to facilitate high-fidelity translation of the intervention to broad clinical practice and Web-based multicenter clinical trials in the future.

AB Purpose - This paper aims to demonstrate how customer knowledge management (CKM) can opportunely support the process of value creation from Big Data. Focusing on tourism as a knowledge-intensive industry, the paper tries to contribute to the debate on management of Big Data by proposing CKM as a meaningful approach for transforming the huge amount of data available on social networks into valuable assets for competitiveness of tourism destinations.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper adopts a qualitative research methodology based on multiple exploratory case studies identified in a set of digital local events related to the Apulia destination (southern Italy).
   Findings - Research findings demonstrate that the three dimensions of CKM (knowledge for, from and about customers) could be adopted as lens for analyzing the huge amount of data created for, from and about tourist experiences and for transforming them into valuable assets supporting the competitiveness of tourism destinations.
   Research limitations/implications - Limitations are related to the industry and the regional dimension of the sample. Accordingly, more research is necessary to prove the validity of the approach and to assure its larger replicability.
   Practical implications - Implications for the agenda of organizations and destinations' makers for designing and implementing knowledge-based services and products arise.
   Originality/value - Elements of originality reside into the adoption of CKM as framework to analyze Big Data in the tourism industry.

AB The aim was to explore the role of consumers' nutrition knowledge while selecting foods for weight management and the predominating food selection factors by combining quantitative and qualitative methodology in a real-life setting during two consecutive shopping tasks given in a supermarket. Thirty-six consumers were given a list of 11 products and asked to think-aloud while selecting (i) a product they usually buy and (ii) a product they use for weight management. After the consecutive shopping tasks, the subjects were interviewed and asked to answer a nutrition knowledge questionnaire. The subjects were categorized by the difference in the energy contents of their selections and the food selection criteria. The energy contents of the selections for weight management were reduced by 10-46%. Ten subjects with the greatest difference between the energy contents of their selections had higher level in nutrition knowledge and mentioned less nutritional issues during the selections than ten subjects with the smallest such differences. Taste was an important product selection criterion by the former group, while the latter focused primarily on price. Nutrition knowledge is interrelated with personal factors and selection goals. It is not necessarily utilized consistently when selecting food products. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Little is known about pressure ulcer prevention practice among pediatric patients. To describe the frequency of pressure ulcer risk assessment in pediatric patients and pressure ulcer prevention intervention use overall and by hospital unit type, a descriptive secondary analysis was performed of data submitted to the National Database for Nursing Quality Indicators ((R)) (NDNQI((R))) for at least 3 of the 4 quarters in 2012. Relevant data on pressure ulcer risk from 271 hospitals across the United States extracted from the NDNQI database included patient skin and pressure ulcer risk assessment on admission, time since the last pressure ulcer risk assessment, method used to assess pressure ulcer risk, and risk status. Extracted data on pressure ulcer prevention included skin assessment, pressure-redistribution surface use, routine repositioning, nutritional support, and moisture management. These data were organized by unit type and merged with data on hospital characteristics for the analysis. The sample included 39 984 patients ages 1 day to 18 years on 678 pediatric acute care units (general pediatrics, pediatric critical care units, neonatal intensive care units, pediatric step-down units, and pediatric rehabilitation units). Descriptive statistics were used to analyze study data. Most of the pediatric patients (33 644; 89.2%) were assessed for pressure ulcer risk within 24 hours of admission. The Braden Q Scale was frequently used to assess risk on general pediatrics units (75.4%), pediatric step-down units (85.5%), pediatric critical care units (81.3%), and pediatric rehabilitation units (56.1%). In the neonatal intensive care units, another scale or method was used more often (55% to 60%) to assess pressure ulcer risk. Of the 11 203 pediatric patients (39%) determined to be at risk for pressure ulcers, the majority (10 741, 95.8%) received some kind of pressure ulcer prevention intervention during the 24 hours preceding the NDNQI pressure ulcer survey. The frequency of prevention intervention use among those at risk ranged from 99.2% for skin assessment to 70.7% for redistribution surface use. Most pediatric patients are being assessed for pressure ulcer risk, but the implementation of interventions to prevent pressure ulcers among children needs to be improved. Future qualitative research should be conducted to determine how and when clinical judgment is used to assess pressure ulcer risk and the type of pressure-redistribution surfaces used among younger pediatric patients.

AB The objective of this paper is to classify and analyse all research on open data performed in the scientific community from a technological viewpoint, providing a detailed exploration based on six key facets: publication venue, impact, subject, domain, life-cycle phases and type of research. This paper therefore provides a consolidated overview of the open data arena that allows readers to identify well-established topics, trends, and open research issues. Additionally, we provide an extensive qualitative discussion of the most interesting findings to pave the way for future research. Our first identification phase resulted in 893 relevant peer-reviewed articles, published between 2006 and 2019 in a wide variety of venues. Analysis of the results shows that open data research grew slowly from 2006 but increased significantly as from 2009. In 2019, research interest in open data from a technological perspective overall decreased. This fact could indicate that research is beginning to stabilise, i.e., the open data research hype is over, and the research field is reaching maturity. Main findings are (i) increasing effort in researching on Semantic Web technologies as a mechanism to publish and reuse linked open data, (ii) software systems are proposed to solve open data technical problems; and (iii) considering technological aspects of legislation and standardization is needed to widely introduce open data in society. Finally, we provide complementary insights regarding open data innovation projects, with special emphasis on publication (e.g., open data portals) and consumption (e.g., open data as business enabler) of open data.

AB Background Patient privacy may conflict with the advancement of knowledge through data sharing. The data contained in primary care records are uniquely comprehensive.
   Aim To explore the knowledge and attitudes of patients and members of the primary healthcare team regarding the sharing of data held in primary care records, with particular reference to data sharing for research and the impact that this may have on trust between patients and health professionals.
   Design of study Qualitative study using quota sampled, semi-structured interviews.
   Setting Five general practices in Leicestershire, UK.
   Method Grounded theory and framework methodology were used. Interviews were transcribed and analysed thematically.
   Results Twenty patients and 15 healthcare professionals and managers were interviewed. Patients had limited knowledge of the type of information held in their general practice records and the ways in which these data are shared, but appeared ready to form preliminary views on issues such as data sharing for audit and disease registration. In this climate of limited awareness, there was no suggestion that concern about data sharing for research adversely affects patient trust or leads patients to withhold relevant information from health professionals in primary care. Interviews carried out with staff suggested a lack of clear practice policies regarding data sharing.
   Conclusions General practices may need to develop policies on data sharing, bring these to the attention of their patient population and improve patient awareness about the nature of the data contained in their records. Researchers should ensure that patients are adequately informed about the nature of data contained in patient records when seeking consent for data extraction.

AB Measuring the 'level of compliance' has emerged as a key performance indicator for MPA success internationally. Accurate interpretation of quantitative and qualitative compliance data is critical for determining which compliance activities contribute to specific management outcomes. To demonstrate the value of enforcement data in effective MPA management, more than 5000 enforcement actions from 2007 to 2013 from five New South Wales (NSW) Marine Parks were analysed. Specifically, it was tested whether through time: (i) the number of enforcement actions standardised by surveillance effort declined-indicating that 'general deterrence' was being achieved; (ii) the number of repeat offenders decreased-indicating that 'specific deterrence' was being achieved; (iii) the number of 'local community' enforcement actions standardised by surveillance effort declined-indicating growing support for marine parks was being achieved at the community level; and (iv) the percentage of young offenders (<25 yr) had declined-indicating that education programs targeting young adults were successful. Results indicated that general deterrence was not being achieved, with offence rates being relatively stable between years. In contrast, compliance measures were achieving individual deterrence, with the percentage of repeat offenders being very low (0.13-0.83%). Although compliance strategies may be making some progress in improving local compliance in some marine parks, the overall offence rate of local communities was concerning. The data suggested that there were major differences in compliance rates among age groups of offenders over time, although the percentage of young offenders declined over time in three marine parks. Over the six-year data collection period, there was no discernable improvement in compliance rates in most NSW Marine Parks. Overall, the significant value of collecting and analysing information on enforcement activities for MPAs was demonstrated, an often neglected aspect of their management world-wide.

AB Recent interest and development in open government data (OGD) has led government agencies of many countries to introduce OGD initiatives. While the performance of OGD initiatives (POI) in some agencies has been impressive, for others it has been less so. To understand the underlying factors that influence OGD initiatives and drawing on the technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework, we propose a model that incorporates seven context-specific TOE variables. The model was tested with two complementary methods applied to responses in 198 surveys completed by Australian government agency employees. In the first stage, structural equation modeling detected that quality of data, management leadership, skilled operational professionals, political commitment, and external pressure significantly contribute to POI. However, the concept of the TOE framework fundamentally implies a joint effect, suggesting a configuration rather than independent effect of TOE variables. Therefore, in the second stage, we investigated the model using fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), which is new to information systems research and appropriate for configuration analyses. The fsQCA results suggested complex configurational trade-off effects among the variables. Specifically, quality of data and metadata, management leadership, skilled operational professionals, and political commitment were found to drive POI. Inhibitors of POI included lack of skilled staff, lack of technology infrastructure, lack of political commitment, and external pressure. Our findings contribute to the information systems literature and managerial practice by providing strategic insight to improve OGD initiatives.

AB Extant research posits that open data could unlock more than $3 trillion in additional value worldwide across various application domains. This paper investigates a data-sharing perspective in business models of platform ecosystems and discusses how platform owners can derive more value using data. We chose a sample of 12 platforms in which data are used as a key resource for service propositions. By contrasting these cases, we identify and analyse four archetypes: data crawler, data marketplace, data aggregator, and data disseminator. We define the key features of these archetypes and demonstrate how they realise value via the platform. These archetypes can guide managers in realising private and public goods via data sharing. Building on our findings, we derive recommendations for data-driven business model innovation for platform ecosystems.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the differences between scientific disciplines (SDs) in Slovenia in research data literacy (RDL) and research data management (RDM) to form recommendations regarding how to move things forward on the institutional and national level. Design/methodology/approach Purposive sample of active researchers was used from widest possible range of SD. Data were collected from April 21 to August 7, 2017, using 24-question online survey (5 demographic, 19 content questions (single/multiple choice and Likert scale type). Bivariate (ANOVA) and multivariate methods (clustering) were used. Findings The authors identified three perception-related and four behavior-related connections; this gave three clusters per area. First, perceptions - skeptical group, mainly social (SocS) and natural sciences (NatS): no clear RDM and ethical issues standpoints, do not agree that every university needs a data management plan (DMP). Careful group, again including mainly SocS and NatS: RDM is problematic and linked to ethical dilemmas, positive toward institutional DMPs. Convinced group, mainly from humanities (HUM), NatS, engineering (ENG) and medicine and health sciences (MedHeS): no problems regarding RDM, agrees this is an ethical question, is positive toward institutional DMP's. Second, behaviors - sparse group, mainly from MedHeS, NatS and HUM, some agricultural scientists (AgS), and some SocS and ENG: do not tag data sets with metadata, do not use file-naming conventions/standards. Frequent group - many ENG, SocS, moderate numbers of NatS, very few AgS and only a few MedHeS and HUM: often use file-naming conventions/standards, version-control systems, have experience with public-domain data, are reluctant to use metadata with their RD. Slender group, mainly from AgS and NatS, moderate numbers of ENG, SocS and HUM, but no MedHeS: often use public-domain data, other three activities are rare. Research limitations/implications Research could be expanded to a wider population, include other stakeholders and use qualitative methods. Practical implications Results are useful for international comparisons but also give foundations and recommendations on institutional and national RDM and RDL policies, implementations, and how to bring academic libraries into the picture. Identified differences suggest that different educational, awareness-raising and participatory approaches are needed for each group. Originality/value The findings offer valuable insight into RDM and RDL of Slovenian scientists, which have not yet been investigated in Slovenia.

AB Computational research and data analytics increasingly relies on complex ecosystems of open source software (OSS) "libraries" - curated collections of reusable code that programmers import to perform a specific task. Software documentation for these libraries is crucial in helping programmers/analysts know what libraries are available and how to use them. Yet documentation for open source software libraries is widely considered low-quality. This article is a collaboration between CSCW researchers and contributors to data analytics OSS libraries, based on ethnographic fieldwork and qualitative interviews. We examine several issues around the formats, practices, and challenges around documentation in these largely volunteer-based projects. There are many different kinds and formats of documentation that exist around such libraries, which play a variety of educational, promotional, and organizational roles. The work behind documentation is similarly multifaceted, including writing, reviewing, maintaining, and organizing documentation. Different aspects of documentation work require contributors to have different sets of skills and overcome various social and technical barriers. Finally, most of our interviewees do not report high levels of intrinsic enjoyment for doing documentation work (compared to writing code). Their motivation is affected by personal and project-specific factors, such as the perceived level of credit for doing documentation work versus more 'technical' tasks like adding new features or fixing bugs. In studying documentation work for data analytics OSS libraries, we gain a new window into the changing practices of data-intensive research, as well as help practitioners better understand how to support this often invisible and infrastructural work in their projects.

AB The management of research data is now a major challenge for research organisations. Vast quantities of born-digital data are being produced in a wide variety of forms at a rapid rate in universities. This paper analyses the contribution of academic libraries to research data management (RDM) in the wider institutional context. In particular it: examines the roles and relationships involved in RDM, identifies the main components of an RDM programme, evaluates the major drivers for RDM activities, and analyses the key factors influencing the shape of RDM developments. The study is written from the perspective of library professionals, analysing data from 26 semi-structured interviews of library staff from different UK institutions. This is an early qualitative contribution to the topic complementing existing quantitative and case study approaches. Results show that although libraries are playing a significant role in RDM, there is uncertainty and variation in the relationship with other stakeholders such as ITservices and research support offices. Current emphases in RDM programmes are on developments of policies and guidelines, with some early work on technology infrastructures and support services. Drivers for developments include storage, security, quality, compliance, preservation, and sharing with libraries associated most closely with the last three. The paper also highlights a 'jurisdictional' driver in which libraries are claiming a role in this space. A wide range of factors, including governance, resourcing and skills, are identified as influencing ongoing developments. From the analysis, a model is constructed designed to capture the main aspects of an institutional RDM programme. This model helps to clarify the different issues involved in RDM, identifying layers of activity, multiple stakeholders and drivers, and a large number of factors influencing the implementation of any initiative. Institutions may usefully benchmark their activities against the data and model in order to inform ongoing RDM activity.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to propose a practicable data-driven theory for the implementation and management of organizational change by combining the organization ambidexterity research and the organization change management research. Design/methodology/approach This study is based on the qualitative approach and uses a single case (in-depth investigation approach) study to come up with a data-driven theory, which is usable in the context of organizational change management and organizational ambidexterity (OA). Besides, in-depth interviews of change management practitioners, this study uses various sources of secondary information. Findings The study finds that owing to the reactive, ad hoc, and discontinuous nature of change often triggered by external factors or internal crisis within the organization, an organization need to continually engage with the existing data. The outcome must be driven toward preparing for the change through data engagement, implementation and reinforcement. The authors found that in order to be successful it is essential to have a strategy, set-up the right operating model, be clear on the scope of the change management work-stream and continuously monitor the progress through defined milestones and acceptance criteria. For companies targeting to achieve competitive differentiation through ambidexterity, a well-grounded change management program is the key for the success. Originality/value The study suggests that there is little work combining organizational change management and OA from a practitioner's point of view. Accordingly, the authors propose a new data-driven organizational change management theory, which the authors term as the tripod theory for organizational change management. A practitioner's perspective on the topic using a case study of an insurance company's data transformation and a framework for structuring the change management program makes a meaningful contribution to the existing literature.

AB While the number of open government data initiatives has increased considerably over the past decade, the impact of these initiatives remains uncertain. Recent studies have been critical of the "bias toward the supply side" and lack of "sufficient attention to the user perspective" in the way that open government data initiatives are implemented. This article asks: (1) who is using municipal open government data resources and for what purposes? and (2) what impact are municipal open government data having in cities where they have been implemented? We performed a qualitative analysis of 26 semi-structured telephone interviews conducted with government staff, civic technologists, and private sector stakeholders in nine cities around the United States. Each of these 30 to 45-minute telephone interviews were transcribed and analyzed to distill insights regarding the use and impact of municipal open government data in the nine cities considered. We find that the array of actors within open government data ecosystems at the local level is expanding as distinctions between the public and private sectors becomes increasingly blurred and that the demands of managing and sustaining these initiatives has led to changes in the services offered by local government, as well as in the duties of government staff. The impact of these data resources has been primarily felt within local government itself, although the lack of monitoring mechanisms makes it difficult to systematically evaluate their broader effects. We conclude that open government data initiatives should be coordinated and better integrated with digital equity and digital inclusion efforts in order to advance their political and social goals.

AB Aims In the face of growing expectations for data transparency and patient engagement in care, we evaluated preferences for patient-reported outcome (PRO) data access and sharing among patients with heart failure (HF) using an ethical framework. Methods and results We conducted qualitative interviews with a purposive sample of patients with HF who participated in a larger 8-week study that involved the collection and return of PROs using a web-based interface. Guided by an ethical framework, patients were asked questions about their preferences for having PRO data returned to them and shared with other groups. Interview transcripts were coded by three study team members using directed content analysis. A total of 22 participants participated in semi-structured interviews. Participants were mostly male (73%), White (68%) with a mean age of 72. Themes were grouped into priorities, benefits, and barriers to data access and sharing. Priorities included ensuring anonymity when data are shared, transparency with intentions of data use, and having access to all collected data. Benefits included: using data as a communication prompt to discuss health with clinicians and using data to support self-management. Barriers included: challenges with interpreting returned results, and potential loss of benefits and anonymity when sharing data. Conclusion Our interviews with HF patients highlight opportunities for researchers to return and share data through an ethical lens, by ensuring privacy and transparency with intentions of data use, returning collected data in comprehensible formats, and meeting individual expectations for data sharing.

AB Medical errors in health care still occur frequently. Unfortunately, errors cannot be completely prevented and 100% safety can never be achieved. Therefore, in addition to error reduction strategies, health care organisations could also implement strategies that promote timely error detection and correction. Reporting and analysis of so-called near misses - usually defined as incidents without adverse consequences for patients - are necessary to gather information about successful error recovery mechanisms. This study establishes the need for a clearer and more consistent definition of near misses to enable large-scale reporting and analysis in order to obtain such information. Qualitative incident reports and interviews were collected on four units of two Dutch general hospitals. Analysis of the 143 accompanying error handling processes demonstrated that different incident types each provide unique information about error handling. Specifically, error handling processes underlying incidents that did not reach the patient differed significantly from those of incidents that reached the patient, irrespective of harm, because of successful countermeasures that had been taken after error detection. We put forward two possible definitions of near misses and argue that, from a practical point of view, the optimal definition may be contingent on organisational context. Both proposed definitions could yield large-scale reporting of near misses. Subsequent analysis could enable health care organisations to improve the safety and quality of care proactively by (1) eliminating failure factors before real accidents occur, (2) enhancing their ability to intercept errors in time, and (3) improving their safety culture.

AB Objective: The introduction of an information system integrated to bedside equipment requires significant financial and resource investment; therefore understanding the potential impact is beneficial for decision-makers. However, no systematic literature reviews (SLRs) focus on this topic. This SLR aims to gather evidence on the impact of the aforementioned system, also known as a patient data management system (PDMS) on both organizational and clinical outcomes.
   Materials and Methods: A literature search was performed using the databases Medline/PubMed and CINHAL for English articles published between January 2000 and December 2012. A quality assessment was performed on articles deemed relevant for the SLR.
   Results: Eighteen articles were included in the SLR. Sixteen articles investigated the impact of a PDMS on the organizational outcomes, comprising descriptive, quantitative and qualitative studies. A PDMS was found to reduce the charting time, increase the time spent on direct patient care and reduce the occurrence of errors. Only two articles investigated the clinical impact of a PDMS. Both reported an improvement in clinical outcomes when a PDMS was integrated with a clinical decision support system (CDSS).
   Conclusions: A PDMS has shown to offer many advantages in both the efficiency and the quality of care delivered to the patient. In addition, a PDMS integrated to a CDSS may improve clinical outcomes, although further studies are required for validation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; NATIONAL REPORT
AB Objectives: (1) To understand the extent to which nursing homes have the capability for data sharing and (2) to explore nursing home leaders' perceptions of data sharing with other health care facilities and with residents and family members.
   Design: Exploratory, mixed-methods.
   Setting and Participants: We conducted a secondary analysis of data from a national survey of nursing home administrative leaders (n = 815) representing every state in the United States. Next, semi-structured interviews were used to elicit rich contextual information from (n = 12) administrators from nursing homes with varying data-sharing capabilities.
   Methods: We used descriptive statistics along with Rao-Scott chi-square and logistic regression models to examine the relationship between health dataesharing capabilities and nursing home characteristics such as location, bed size, and type of ownership. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis.
   Results: Of the 815 nursing homes completing the survey, 95% had computerized (electronic) medical records, and 46% had some capability for health information exchange. Nursing homes located in metropolitan areas had 2.53 (95% confidence interval = 1.53, 4.18) times greater odds for having health information exchange capability compared with nursing homes in small towns. Perceived challenges to health data sharing with residents and family members and external clinical partners include variance in systems and software, privacy and security concerns, and organizational factors slowing uptake of technology. Perceived benefits of health data sharing included improved communication, improved care planning, and anticipating future demand.
   Conclusions and Implications: As health data sharing becomes more ubiquitous in acute care settings, policy makers, nursing home leaders, and other stakeholders should prepare by working to mitigate barriers and capitalize on potential benefits of implementing this technology in nursing homes.

AB Purpose The purpose of this study is twofold: to investigate the role of big data in firms' co-knowledge and value creation and to understand the underlying drivers behind value creation through big data in the oil and gas industry by underscoring the role of firms' capabilities, trends and challenges. Design/methodology/approach Following an inductive approach, semi-structured interviews were conducted with senior managers and analysts working in oil and gas companies across eight countries. The data collected from these key informants were then analysed using the qualitative data analysis software ATLAS.ti. Findings Value creation through big data is an important factor for enhancing performance. It has a positive impact on both tangible (organisational performance) and intangible (societal) aspects depending on the context. Oil and gas companies understand the importance of big data to creating value in their operations. However, implementing and using big data has been problematic. In this study, a framework was developed to show that factors such as the shortage of data experts, poor data quality, the risk of cyber-attacks and unsupportive organisational cultures impede its implementation and utilisation. Originality/value This study contributes to the value creation literature in the big data context. The findings identify the key areas to be considered for the effective implementation and utilisation of big data in the oil and gas sector. This study addresses a broad but under-explored issue (i.e. knowledge creation from big data and its implementation) and strengthens the academic debate within this research stream.

ID INFORMATICS; BEHAVIOR
AB Objectives: A. Identify the current state of data management needs of academic biomedical researchers. B. Explore their anticipated data management and analysis needs. C. Identify barriers to addressing those needs.
   Design: A multimodal needs analysis was conducted using a combination of an online survey and in-depth one-on-one semi-structured interviews. Subjects were recruited via an e-mail list representing a wide range of academic biomedical researchers in the Pacific Northwest.
   Measurements: The results from 286 survey respondents were used to provide triangulation of the qualitative analysis of data gathered from 15 semi-structured in-depth interviews.
   Results: Three major themes were identified: 1) there continues to be widespread use of basic general-purpose applications for core data management; 2) there is broad perceived need for additional support in managing and analyzing large datasets; and 3) the barriers to acquiring currently available tools are most commonly related to financial burdens on small labs and unmet expectations of institutional support.
   Conclusion: Themes identified in this study suggest that at least some common data management needs will best be served by improving access to basic level tools such that researchers can solve their own problems. Additionally, institutions and informaticians should focus on three components: 1) facilitate and encourage the use of modern data exchange models and standards, enabling researchers to leverage a common layer of interoperability and analysis; 2) improve the ability of researchers to maintain provenance of data and models as they evolve over time though tools and the leveraging of standards; and 3) develop and support information management service cores that could assist in these previous components while providing researchers with unique data analysis and information design support within a spectrum of informatics capabilities.

ID MEMORANDUM
AB Aim of the study The digital transformation in healthcare is also of fundamental importance for healthcare research. For this reason, experts should agree on, prioritize and identify key topics for a medium-term strategy of the German Network for Health Services Research and classify the general development of digital health in the context of health services research. Methods Between April and September 2018, the working groups "Digital Health" and "Validation and Linkage of Secondary Data" of the German Network for Health Services Research were asked to submit their expertise online using the methodological approach of a Delphi study. For this purpose, a multi-stage modified Delphi method with quantitative and qualitative approaches was chosen. Initially, a list of theses was drawn from the network's published position papers on digital health applications and medical apps. A total of 131 statements were formulated. The final survey instrument included questions on the biographical background of the participants, 42 developed items (33 statements and 8 open-ended questions), and one free-text field to add further aspects. Items were evaluated with a five-point Likert scale. A statement was accepted if the agreement rate was 75% or higher. Results Of the 110 potential participants, 50 (46%) took part in the first round and 39 (36%) in the second round of the Delphi survey. In the first round, there was a clear result for 24 of 33 statements. There were 20 statements "agreed with" and four "disagreed with." Nine statements were between 60 and 75% and were presented to the participants again for evaluation in the second round. In round two, of these nine statements, four statements were "agreed with" and five statements were "disagreed with." Digital Health Literacy" emerged as a particular focus in this Delphi study. Conclusion In this Delphi study, experts were involved in selecting and prioritizing possible topics for the Digital Health working group and assessing future developments in digital health in the context of health services research. The results reflect both the expectations and interests of the members and are largely consistent with the recommendations of the report "Digitalization for Health" made by the expert council for assessing developments in the health sector.

AB Increasing attention is being paid to the importance and potential of crowd-sourced data to complement current environmental data-streams (i.e. in-situ observations and RS data). In parallel, the diffusion of Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) that are interactive and easy to use have provided a way forward in facing extreme climatic events and the threatening hazards resulting from those. The combination of these two trends is referred to as ICT-enabled 'citizen observatories' of the environment. Nevertheless, the success of these citizen observatories hinges on the continued involvement of citizens as central actors of these initiatives. Developing strategies to (further) engage citizens requires in-depth understanding of the behavioral determinants that encourage or impede individuals to collect and share environment-related data. This paper takes the case of citizen-sensed weather data using Personal Weather Stations (PWSs) and looks at the drivers and barriers for sharing such data via online amateur weather networks. This is done employing a behavioral science lens that considers data sharing a decision and systematically investigates the influential factors that affect this decision. The analysis and findings are based on qualitative empirical research carried out in the Netherlands, United Kingdom and Italy. Subsequently, a model was developed that depicts the main drivers and barriers for citizen participation in weather observatories. This resulting model can be utilized as a tool to develop strategies for further enhancing ICT-enabled citizen participation in climatic observations and, consequently, in environmental management.

AB The objective of this study was to determine whether there was a quantifiable improvement in learning outcomes by integrating course materials in a 4-year baccalaureate program, utilizing a knowledge repository with a conceptual map that spans a discipline. Two new models were developed to provide the framework for this knowledge repository. A design artifact, Constructivist Unifying Baccalaureate Epistemology (CUBE), was developed and tested and incorporates these models. This CUBE artifact incorporates a Semantic Web ontology and a W3C Resource Description Framework to create a concept space that offers a unified view of the discipline. The Knowledge Repository was modeled as an organic structure with the ability to evolve over time by incorporating a ranking/voting feature which enables students and faculty to add content to the knowledge base and collectively evaluate the relative weights of conceptual threads. Conceptual Clustering was used to create a concept map for traversing the Knowledge Repository. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the Knowledge Repository, a triangulated research approach was used, which cross checked results with multiple data sources and utilized qualitative and quantitative methods to validate the test instruments. The analyses included: focus groups, semistructured interviews, a questionnaire, and a quantitative exam that measured knowledge spanning multiple courses. Four classes participated during two semesters with four faculty members, using control and treatment groups. The research contrasted conventional single course instruction versus an Integrated Knowledge Repository (IKR) approach to learning. There was an average increase of 25 points in scores on a comprehensive exam for students who used the Knowledge Repository. The results supported our main hypothesis, that oStudents utilizing the IKR will develop a more complex understanding of the interconnected nature of the materials linking a discipline than those students who take conventional single topic courseso.

ID CONTEXT
AB There has been a market surge in both provision of and demand for fitness applications and sport wearables. These wearables often come equipped with highly sophisticated biometric data (e.g. heart rate) functionalities that make the capture and sharing of such biometric data increasingly common practice. A few research studies have considered the effect that sharing biometric data has on those individuals sharing this data. However, little is known regarding the social impact of sharing this data in real-time and online. In this study, we investigate whether there is value in sharing heart rate data within social applications and whether sharing this data influences the behavior of those seeing this data.
   We do so by conducting a study where the heart rate data of runners competing in a 5-km road race is shared in real-time with 140 online spectators. We collect rich quantitative data of user interaction though server logs, and a qualitative data set through interviews and online users' comments.
   We then compare and contrast the behavior of online spectators who are presented with heart rate data together with contextual data, and those who are only presented with contextual data, for example, location. We also examine whether this difference is dependent on the social relation between the athletes and the spectators. Results indicate that spectators who are presented with the runners' heart rate data support the athletes more and rate the presented system more positively. These effects are dependent on the social tie between the athletes and spectators. This is one of the first studies to carry out an empirical investigation in the wild on the effects of sharing heart rate data in an online social context. In this light, in addition to supporting earlier literature, the outcomes present new insights and research directions within the sporting context.

SO ADDICTIVE BEHAVIORS

DE Video games; Problem gambling; Loot boxes
ID CONVERGENCE; INDUSTRY
AB Introduction: Loot boxes are purchasable randomised reward mechanisms in video games. Due to structural and psychological similarities with gambling, there are fears that loot box purchasing may be associated with problematic gambling. Whilst monthly expenditure is typically modest (i.e. < $20), the distribution is highly skewed, with a small number of high-level spenders, sometimes referred to as "whales". It is not known what proportion of industry profits are derived from such players, and whether they are typically wealthy individuals and/or problem gamblers. Methods: We used structured literature searches to identify surveys of gamers with open-access loot box data. The resulting datasets were aggregated, and correlations between loot box expenditure, problem gambling and earnings investigated using Spearman's rho correlations.
   Results: The combined open-access data comprised 7,767 loot box purchasers (5,933 with self-report earnings). Secondary analysis of this self-report data confirmed that disproportionate revenue appears to be generated from high-level spenders: the top 5% of spenders (> $100/month) represent half of loot box revenue. Previously reported correlations between problem gambling and loot box expenditure were confirmed, with an aggregate correlation of rho = 0.34, p < .001. In contrast, there was no significant correlation between loot box spend and earnings rho = 0.02, p = .10.
   Conclusion: Our secondary analysis suggests that games developers (unwittingly or not) are disproportionately profiting from moderate and high-risk gamblers, rather than high earning customers. Such patterns of spending mirror those observed with gambling revenues, and have implications for harm minimisation and ongoing policy debates around loot boxes.

AB Vertical and horizontal alignment within organizations are seen as prerequisites for meeting strategic objectives and indications of effective management. In the area of safety management, the concept of vertical alignment has been followed through the introduction of hierarchical structures and bidirectional communication, but horizontal alignment has been given little attention. The principal goal of this study was the assessment of horizontal alignment within an aviation organization with the use of data from safety investigations, audits and meetings in order to explore the extent to which (1) causal factors recorded in safety investigation reports comprised topics discussed by safety committees and focus areas of internal safety auditors, and (2) the agendas of safety committees include weak points revealed during safety audits. The study employed qualitative and quantitative analysis of data collected over a 6 years' period at three organizational levels. The results suggested a low horizontal alignment across the three pairs of the corresponding safety management activities within each organizational level. The findings were attributed to the inadequacy of procedures and lack of a safety information database for consistently sharing safety information, cultural factors and lack of planning for the coordination of safety management activities. The current research comprises a contribution to the literature and practice and introduces a technique to assess the intra-alignment of safety management initiatives within various organizational levels. Future research is needed in order to investigate the association between horizontal alignment of safety management practices and safety performance. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose Although big data may enhance the visibility, transparency, and responsiveness of supply chains, whether it is effective for improving supply chain performance in a turbulent environment, especially in mitigating the impact of COVID-19, is unclear. The research question the authors addressed is: How do logistics firms improve the supply chain performance in COVID-19 through big data and supply chain integration (SCI)? Design/methodology/approach The authors used a mixed-method approach with four rounds of data collection. A three-round survey of 323 logistics firms in 26 countries in Europe, America, and Asia was first conducted. The authors then conducted in-depth interviews with 55 logistics firms. Findings In the first quantitative study, the authors find mediational mechanisms through which big data analytics technology capability (BDATC) and SCI influence supply chain performance. In particular, BDATC and SCI are two second-order capabilities that help firms develop three first-order capabilities (i.e. proactive capabilities, reactive capabilities, and resource reconfiguration) and eventually lead to innovation capability and disaster immunity that allow firms to survive in COVID-19 and improve supply chain performance. The results of the follow-up qualitative analysis not only confirm the inferences from the quantitative analysis but also provide complementary insights into organizational culture and the institutional environment. Originality/value The authors contribute to supply chain risk management by developing a three-level hierarchy of capabilities framework and finding a mechanism with the links between big data and big disaster. The authors also provide managerial implications for logistics firms to address the new management challenges posed by COVID-19.

AB IntroductionThe accurate analysis and comparison of transport indicators from a large variety of urban areas can help to evaluate the performance of different adopted transport policies. This paper attempts to determine important transport and socio-economic indicators from 151 urban areas and 51 countries, based on comparable, directly observable open-source data such as OpenstreetMap (OSM) and the TomTom database.AnalysisThis is the first, systematic indicator-analysis using recent, open source data from different urban areas around the world. The indicator road kilometers per person, sometimes cited as infrastructure accessibility is calculated by processing OSM data. Information on congestion levels have been taken from the TomTom database and socio-economic data from various, publicly accessible databases. Relations between indicators are identified through correlations and regression models are calibrated, quantifying the relation between transport infrastructure and performance indicators. Three sub-categories of cities with different population sizes (small cities, large cities and metropolises) are defined and studied individually. In addition, a qualitative analysis is performed, putting five different indicators into relation.Results & ConclusionsThe main results reconfirm previous findings but with a larger sample size and more comparable data. Good correlation values between infrastructure accessibility, socio-economic indicators, and congestion levels are demonstrated. It is shown that cities with higher GDP have generally built more infrastructure which in turn reduces their congestion levels. In particular, for cities with low population density (above approximately 1500 inh. Per sq.km), more roads per inhabitant lead to lower congestion levels; cities with high population density have in general lower congestion levels if the rail infrastructure per person ratio is high. Furthermore, these cities increasing railways per person is more effective in reducing congestions than increasing road length per person.

AB PurposeOne of the currently debated changes in scientific practice is the implementation of data sharing requirements for peer-reviewed publication to increase transparency and intersubjective verifiability of results. However, it seems that data sharing is a not fully adopted behavior among researchers. The theory of planned behavior was repeatedly applied to explain drivers of data sharing from the perspective of data donors (researchers). However, data sharing can be viewed from another perspective as well: survey participants. The research questions (RQs) for this study were as follows: 1 Does data sharing increase participant's nonresponse? 2 Does data sharing influence participant's response behavior? The purpose of this paper is to address these issues.Design/methodology/approachTo answer the RQs, a mixed methods approach was applied, consisting of a qualitative prestudy and a quantitative survey including an experimental component. The latter was a two-group setup with an intervention group (A) and a control group (B). A list-based recruiting of members of the Medical Faculty of the University of Freiburg was applied for 15 days. For exploratory data analysis of dropouts and nonresponse, we used Fisher's exact tests and binary logistic regressions.FindingsIn sum, we recorded 197 cases for Group A and 198 cases for Group B. We found no systematic group differences regarding response bias or dropout. Furthermore, we gained insights into the experiences our sample made with data sharing: half of our sample already requested data of other researchers or shared data on request of other researchers. Data repositories, however, were used less frequently: 28% of our respondents used data from repositories and 19% stored data in a repository.Originality/valueTo the authors' knowledge, their study is the first study that includes researchers as survey subjects investigating the effect of data sharing on their response patterns.

AB Introduction International sharing of health data opens the door to the study of the so-called 'Big Data', which holds great promise for improving patient-centred care. Failure of recent data sharing initiatives indicates an urgent need to invest in societal trust in researchers and institutions. Key to an informed understanding of such a 'social license' is identifying the views patients and the public may hold with regard to data sharing for health research. Methods We performed a narrative review of the empirical evidence addressing patients' and public views and attitudes towards the use of health data for research purposes. The literature databases PubMed (MEDLINE), Embase, Scopus and Google Scholar were searched in April 2019 to identify relevant publications. Patients' and public attitudes were extracted from selected references and thematically categorised. Results Twenty-seven papers were included for review, including both qualitative and quantitative studies and systematic reviews. Results suggest widespread-though conditional-support among patients and the public for data sharing for health research. Despite the fact that participants recognise actual or potential benefits of data research, they expressed concerns about breaches of confidentiality and potential abuses of the data. Studies showed agreement on the following conditions: value, privacy, risk minimisation, data security, transparency, control, information, trust, responsibility and accountability. Conclusions Our results indicate that a social license for data-intensive health research cannot simply be presumed. To strengthen the social license, identified conditions ought to be operationalised in a governance framework that incorporates the diverse patient and public values, needs and interests.

AB Climate extremes are one of the main drivers of acute food insecurity. In Guatemala, acute food insecurity reaches alarming levels when the usual dry period during the bimodal rainy seasons is extended or starts earlier than expected. Drought has a slow-onset which theoretically leaves sufficient lead-time for addressing impacts on food security. In practice, emergency response to drought is often reactive and arrives late, starting when the crisis is already evolving. Climate services and food security information systems are key ingredients for integrated climate risk and food security management worldwide. In Guatemala, stakeholders broadly agree on the usefulness of this type of information for decision-making and direct significant efforts towards improving information availability and quality. But the impact of agro-climatic and food security information on decisions is ad hoc or not systematic. Through a mix of qualitative, ethnographic, and participatory methods, we investigated why this situation occurs. We found that different aspects lead to this phenomenon: the impact of drought on food security is mediated by different socio-economic, political, and institutional factors that tend to differ strongly between regions or even communities across the country. This puts special requirements on information provision for decision-making. Information use patterns can be explained by technical, data-related aspects as reliability, timeliness, or accessibility. But only by considering the institutional and organizational context we get a complete understanding on what frames the information-use patterns in climate and food security management in Guatemala. Our research shows that investments in technical aspects of data provision and infrastructure for increased climate and food security management need to address institutional and organizational challenges in order to be effective.

AB Patient experiences with symptom care need to be assessed and documented to ensure successful management of cancer-related symptoms. This paper details one method for creating symptom management quality improvement (SMQI) reports, including case-mix adjustment of patient-reported measures. Qualitative data regarding the acceptability of these reports at participating cancer centers (CCs) are also provided.
   Data were collected from 2226 patients treated at 16 CCs via mailed/Web questionnaires. Twelve items assessing patient perceptions of symptom management-pain, fatigue, emotional distress-served as key quality indicators. Medico-demographic variables suitable for case-mix adjustment were selected using an index score combining predictive power and heterogeneity across CCs. SMQI reports were designed with staff feedback and produced for each CC, providing crude and adjusted CC-specific rates, along with study-wide rates for comparison purposes.
   Cancer type and participant educational level were selected for case-mix adjustment based upon high index scores. The Kendall rank correlation coefficient showed that case-mix adjustments changed the ranking of CCs on the key quality indicators (% Delta rank range: 5-22 %). The key quality indicators varied across CCs (all p < 0.02). SMQI reports were well received by CC staff, who described plans to share them with key personnel (e.g., cancer committee, navigator).
   This paper provides one method for creating hospital-level SMQI reports, including case-mix adjustment. Variation between CCs on key quality indicators, even after adjustment, suggested room for improvement. SMQI reports based on patient-reported data can inform and motivate efforts to improve care through professional/patient education and applying standards of care.

AB Traditional software project management theory often focuses on desk-based development of software and algorithms, much in line with the traditions of the classical project management and software engineering. This can be described as a tools and techniques perspective, which assumes that software project management success is dependent on having the right instruments available, rather than on the individual qualities of the project manager or the cumulative qualities and skills of the software organisation. Surprisingly, little is known about how (or whether) these tools techniques are used in practice. This study, in contrast, uses a qualitative grounded theory approach to develop the basis for an alternative theoretical perspective: that of competence. A competence approach to understanding software project management places the responsibility for success firmly on the shoulders of the people involved, project members, project leaders, managers. The competence approach is developed through an investigation of the experiences of project managers in a medium sized software development company (WM-data) in Denmark. Starting with a simple model relating project conditions, project management competences and desired project outcomes, we collected data through interviews, focus groups and one large plenary meeting with most of the company's project managers. Data analysis employed content analysis for concept (variable) development and causal mapping to trace relationships between variables. In this way we were able to build up a picture of the competences project managers use in their daily work at WM-data, which we argue is also partly generalisable to theory. The discrepancy between the two perspectives is discussed, particularly in regard to the current orientation of the software engineering field. The study provides many methodological and theoretical starting points for researchers wishing to develop a more detailed competence perspective of software project managers' work.

AB Most recent discussion of the adaptive reuse of school land has focused almost exclusively on repurposing or redeploying vacant school space rather than comprehensively re-planning and constructing the entire school land for the overall needs of society and urban development. The relevant government agencies for school land reuse in Taiwan, such as the Ministry of Education and municipal governments, mostly provide subjective regulations or revitalization provisions for the sustainable development of school resources; however, no specific scientific assessment or a planning procedure has been proposed to revitalize school land. Therefore, constructing a scientific, quantitative, and objective planning framework and procedure is necessary for the adaptive reuse of school land based on the needs of overall society and urban development in order to replace the existing and outdated planning philosophy and to correct prominent shortcomings of past planning operations that were solely in accordance with the qualitative judgment and decision making of official agencies. In this study, we mainly adopted the analytic network process (ANP) and big data, including demographics, facility usage, and social welfare indicators, to assist the Taipei City government to construct or reform land reuse strategies for junior high and elementary schools facing immediate or future closure, consolidation, or downsizing. To take a more realistic approach to improve final decision making, the investigation of expert questionnaires through the ANP was based on the consideration of future trends that were objectively evaluated by big datasets. The novel planning philosophy and concise decision framework for reuse strategies we designed are expected to improve public decision-making transparency, adaptive reuse effectiveness, and quality of urban life. Ultimately, our proposed strategies and suggestions can not only assist local public sectors to promote the policy of adaptive reuse of surplus school lands but also serve as an appropriate blueprint of urban sustainability for the central government in the near future.

AB Industry data sharing has the potential to revolutionise evidence on video gaming and mental health, as well as a host of other critical topics. However, collaborative data sharing agreements between academics and industry partners may also afford industry enormous power in steering the development of this evidence base. In this paper, we outline how nonfinancial conflicts of interest may emerge when industry share data with academics. We then go on to describe ways in which such conflicts may affect the quality of the evidence base. Finally, we suggest strategies for mitigating this impact and preserving research independence. We focus on the development of data infrastructure: technological, social, and educational architecture that facilitates unfettered and free access to the kinds of high-quality data that industry hold, but without industry involvement.

DE property valuation; property taxation; remote sensing; land; UAV
ID UAV
AB Remotely sensed data is increasingly applied across many domains, including fit-for-purpose land administration (FFPLA), where the focus is on fast, affordable, and accurate property information collection. Property valuation, as one of the main functions of land administration systems, is influenced by locational, physical, legal, and economic factors. Despite the importance of property valuation to economic development, there are often no standardized rules or strict data requirements for property valuation for taxation in developing contexts, such as Rwanda. This study aims at assessing different remote sensing data in support of developing a new approach for property valuation for taxation in Rwanda; one that aligns with the FFPLA philosophy. Three different remote sensing technologies, (i) aerial images acquired with a digital camera, (ii) WorldView2 satellite images, and (iii) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images obtained with a DJI Phantom 2 Vision Plus quadcopter, are compared and analyzed in terms of their fitness to fulfil the requirements for valuation for taxation purposes. Quantitative and qualitative methods are applied for the comparative analysis. Prior to the field visit, the fundamental concepts of property valuation for taxation and remote sensing were reviewed. In the field, reference data using high precision GNSS (Leica) was collected and used for quantitative assessment. Primary data was further collected via semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions. The results show that UAVs have the highest potential for collecting data to support property valuation for taxation. The main reasons are the prime need for accurate-enough and up-to-date information. The comparison of the different remote sensing techniques and the provided new approach can support land valuers and professionals in the field in bottom-up activities following the FFPLA principles and maintaining the temporal quality of data needed for fair taxation.

AB Contemporary cities are witnessing momentous shifts in how institutions and individuals produce and circulate data. Despite recent trends claiming that anyone can create and use data, cities remain marked by persistently uneven access and usage of digital technologies. This is the case as well within the emergent phenomenon of the 'smart city,' where open data are a key strategy for achieving 'smartness,' and increasingly constitute a fundamental dimension of urban life, governance, economic activity, and epistemology. The digital ethnography has extended traditional ethnographic research practices into such digital realms, yet its applicability within open data and smart cities is unclear. The method has tended to overlook the important roles of particular digital artifacts such as the database in structuring and producing knowledge. In this paper, we develop the database ethnography as a rich methodological resource for open data research. This approach centers the database as a key site for the production and materialization of social meaning. The database ethnography draws attention to the ways digital choices and practices-around database design, schema, data models, and so on-leave traces through time. From these traces, we may infer lessons about how phenomena come to be encoded as data and acted upon in urban contexts. Open databases are, in other words, key ways in which knowledges about the smart city are framed, delimited, and represented. More specifically, we argue that open databases limit data types, categorize and classify data to align with technical specifications, reflect the database designer's episteme, and (re)produce conceptions of the world. We substantiate these claims through a database ethnography of the open data portal for the city of Calgary, in Western Canada.

AB Due to the global demographic change many more people will need to work until an older age, and organisations and enterprises need to implement measures to facilitate an extended working life. The aim of this study was to investigate organisational measures and suggestions to promote and make improvements for a healthy and sustainable working life for all ages in an extended working life. This is a qualitative study, and the data were collected through both focus group interviews and individual interviews that included 145 participants. The study identified several suggestions for measures and actions to increase employability in the themes: to promote a good physical and mental work environment; to promote personal financial and social security; to promote relations, social inclusion and social support in the work situation; and to promote creativity, knowledge development and intrinsic work motivation, i.e., based on the spheres of determination in the theoretical swAge-model (sustainable working life for all ages). Based on the study results a tool for dialogue and discussion on employee work situation and career development was developed, and presented in this article. Regular conversations, communication and close dialogue are needed and are a prerequisite for good working conditions and a sustainable working environment, as well as to be able to manage employees and develop the organisation further. The identified measures need to be revisited regularly throughout the employees' entire working life to enable a healthy and sustainable working life for all ages.

AB Purpose: Case managers facilitate continuity of care for persons living with HIV (PLWH) by coordination of resources and referrals to social services and medical care. The complexity of HIV care and associated comorbidities drives the need for medical and psychosocial care coordination, which may be achieved through health information exchange (HIE) systems. However, the use of HIE has not been well studied in the context of HIV services. The purpose of this descriptive qualitative study is to explore factors influencing case managers' adoption of electronic clinical data (ECD) summaries as an HIE strategy in HIV care through application of the "fit between individuals, task and technology" (FITT) framework.
   Methods: Focus group methodology was used to gather perceptions from 48 participants who provided direct case management services for PLWH in New York City. Questions addressed current quality and efficiency challenges to HIE utilization in the context of case management of PLWH as well as barriers and enablers to use of an ECD summary. Analysis of the data was guided by the FITT framework.
   Results: Major themes by interaction type were: (1) task-technology fit - resources, time and workflow; (2) individual-task fit - training and technical support; and 3) individual-technology fit - ECD summary functionality, technical difficulties and the need of a computer for each end-user.
   Conclusions: Our findings provide evidence for the applicability of the FITT framework to explore case managers' perceptions of factors influencing the adoption of ECD summary systems for HIV care prior to actual implementation. Assessment of fit among individual, task, and technology and addressing the concerns identified prior to implementation is critical to successful adoption of health information technology as a strategy to improve quality and efficiency in health care.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore the managerial decision-making challenges of the use of data from online and offline customer data flooding into firms and managed through interactive dashboards. The paper provides insights into how managers within the hotel sector both manage and use the data as a core tool in discussions with finance managers/directors during negotiation on critical marketing investments.
   Design/methodology/approach The research design followed a multiple-case study design of five market-orientated hotels, which were selected as high performing data and dashboard users. Across each case company multiple informants were interviewed and shadowed, including marketing managers, general managers and finance managers/directors. There was also an in-depth investigation of the collection, dissemination and particularly use of traditional market research data and online data from social media sites, web sites and web and mobile analytics. This was augmented by a study of the customized, off site managed interactive databases, in use in all case companies.
   Findings This paper identifies managerial challenges experienced by general managers, marketing and financial managers using digital customer data. It investigated the power of the customer voice internally and found that unstructured qualitative data had greater visibility and usage once supported by a financial imperative. It also found that the use of interactive dashboards were a powerful manifestation of data technology use and increased marketing's visibility, power and accountability within the firm.
   Research limitations/implications The paper provided a limited hotel perspective which impacts on generalizability. The findings should be tested quantitatively to ascertain their validity across a wider sector of businesses and operations. Though multiple site and cross-functional research adds value, one site might have provided more depth.
   Practical implications This paper reveals that managers need support in terms of time, resources and personnel to manage the flood of information into their organizations. It also suggested that general and marketing managers need to develop the skills to interpret the data for decision-making, so that the financial implications are understand.
   Originality/value Most social media studies within the hotel sector focus on the impact of social media reviews on consumer purchasing processes and/or on how managers communicate online with consumers. This paper takes an internal managerial perspective on data use for decision-making. This paper expands our understanding of marketing strategic decision-making through an in-depth exploration into how cross-functional decision-making uses contemporary customer data.

ID QUALITY; BARRIERS
AB Purpose - Master data management (MDM) aims to improve the value of an organization's most important data, such as customer data, by bridging the silos between organizational units and information systems. However, incorporating data management practices into an organization is not a simple task. The purpose of this paper is to provide a new understanding of the challenges in establishing and developing the MDM function within an organization.
   Design/methodology/approach - This papers report an ethnographic study within a municipality. The data were collected from two consecutive MDM development projects over the time period of 32 months by observing MDM-related activities and interviewing appropriate actors. Observations, interviews, and impressions were documented to a diary that was later qualitatively analyzed. Various project documentation were also used.
   Findings - In total 15 challenges were identified. Seven of these were not identified earlier in the literature. New challenges included legislation-driven challenges, mutual understanding of master data domains, and the level of granularity for those domains. Eight issues, such as data owner and data definitions, were MDM specific, others being more generic. All of the issues were identified as preconditions or as affecting factors for the others. Three of the issues were identified as pivotal. The issues emphasize strong alignment between the complex concept of MDM and the organization adopting it.
   Research limitations/implications - This research was based on a single qualitative case study, and caution should be exercised with regard to generalizations. The findings increase understanding about the complex organizational phenomena. The study offers public sector and private sector practitioners insights of the organizational issues that establishing a MDM function can encounter.
   Originality/value - The issues discovered in the research shed light on the strong alignment between the complex concept of MDM and the organization. The results of this study assist researchers in their endeavor to understand the organizational aspects of MDM, and to build theoretical models, frameworks, practices, and explanations.

AB In this article we describe the use of a data-sharing focus group for triangulation with face-to-face interviews. In contrast to member-checking triangulation, this focus group was undertaken to provide a different interactional context to analyze moral discourses in talk about asthma medicine taking. Using principles of discursive psychology to analyze data, participants adopted strategies to manage dilemmas of identification with research findings. Talk about medicine taking was contextualized to the demands of the interaction. Strategies included avoiding direct reference to findings; collectively aligning with medical perspectives; and using stories to carry opinions. Participants also expressed moral discourses around managing asthma in everyday life. These discursive variations strengthened assertions of the role of morality in participants' talk and highlighted advantages in engaging with participants' strategies in focus groups. Different viewpoints identified in this research create problems for member checking, suggesting that researchers need to be sensitive in considering methods of sharing data with participants.

DT Article
ID FOREST; ENERGY; HEALTH
AB Economic, political, social, and military activities all fall under the umbrella of government duties. The modification and reinterpretation of economic functions are the primary focus of the innovation in government administration style under the wave of economic globalisation. The effectiveness of the government's economic administration determines the general level of public administration at the federal level. An essential issue of national public administration that has a significant impact on the political growth of many nations is the performance evaluation of government economic administration. The people are the subject of government economic administration performance evaluation, and the people adjudicate the outcomes. An essential method of assessing the productivity of various departments is through performance review. The nation is currently in the process of switching from its long-standing planned economic system to a market economic system. The internal and external environments of governmental organisations are continually changing in addition to the strong trend of economic globalisation. Determining and advancing the national government's economic administration model is so crucial. The article offers a multidimensional data mining-based optimum design scheme for the thorough assessment of government economic administration performance. The fuzzy comprehensive evaluation rule is an effective method for quantifying the qualitative indicators when the quantitative indicators in the evaluation index system are difficult to measure. It is relatively simple, reasonable, and simple to operate in practise, which is conducive to the thorough and scientific performance evaluation of the government economic administration's science and technology administration functions. Following an assessment of the system's performance using association rule data mining technologies, a simulation test analysis is completed. The accuracy of the proposed arithmetic, which is 8.26% higher than the conventional arithmetic, is demonstrated by simulation results. The development of an evaluation model that incorporates both subjective and objective criteria, as well as the thorough assessment of the effectiveness of government economic administration based on data mining technologies, has excellent application prospects and practical value.

AB Background: Although continuity of care in paediatric palliative care (PPC) is considered to be an essential element of quality of care, it's implementation is challenging. In Belgium, five paediatric liaison teams (PLTs) deliver palliative care. A Royal Decree issued in 2010 provides the legal framework that defines the PLTs' missions, as ensuring continuity of curative and palliative care between the hospital and home for children diagnosed with life-limiting conditions. This national study describes how PLTs ensure continuity of care by describing their activities and the characteristics of the children they cared for from 2010 to 2014.
   Methods: Thematic analysis of open-ended questions was performed and descriptive statistics of aggregated data issued from annual reports, collected by the Belgian Ministry of Public Health through the Cancer Plan was used. A review panel of PLT members discussed the results and contributed to their interpretation.
   Results: Between 2010 and 2014, 3607 children and young adults (0-21 years) were cared for by the 5 Belgian PLTs (mean of 721/per year). Of these children, 50% were diagnosed with an oncological disease, 27% with a neurological or metabolic disease. Four hundred and twenty eight (428) children had died. For 51% of them, death took place at home. PLT activities include coordination; communication; curative and palliative care; education; research and fundraising. Different perceptions of what constitutes a palliative stage, heterogeneity in reporting diagnosis and the current lack of specific valid indicators to report PPC activities were found.
   Conclusion: PLTs are offering highly individualised, flexible and integrated care from diagnosis to bereavement in all care settings. Improvements in data registration and implementation of outcome measures are foreseen.

TI Can Methods Developed for Interpreting Group-level Patient-reported
   Outcome Data be Applied to Individual Patient Management?

AB Background: Patient-reported outcome (PRO) data may be used at 2 levels: to evaluate impacts of disease and treatment aggregated across individuals (group-level) and to screen/monitor individual patients to inform their management (individual-level). For PRO data to be useful at either level, we need to understand their clinical relevance. Purpose: To provide clarity on whether and how methods historically developed to interpret group-based PRO research results might be applied in clinical settings to enable PRO data from individual patients to inform their clinical management and decision-making. Methods: We first differentiate PRO-based decision-making required at group versus individual levels. We then summarize established group-based approaches to interpretation (anchor-based and distribution based), and more recent methods that draw on item calibrations and qualitative research methods. We then assess the applicability of these methods to individual patient data and individual-level decision-making. Findings: Group-based methods provide a range of thresholds that are useful in clinical care: some provide screening thresholds for patients who need additional clinical assessment and/or intervention, some provide thresholds for classifying an individual's level of severity of symptoms or problems with function, and others provide thresholds for meaningful change when monitoring symptoms and functioning over time during or after interventions. Availability of established cut-points for screening and symptom severity, and normative/reference values, may play into choice of PRO measures for use in clinical care. Translatability of thresholds for meaningful change is more problematic because of the greater reliability needed at the individual-level versus group-level, but group-based methods may provide lower bound estimates. Caution is needed to set thresholds above bounds of measurement error to avoid "false-positive changes" triggering unwarranted alerts and action in clinic. Conclusions: While there are some challenges in applying available methods for interpreting group-based PRO results to individual patient data and clinical care-including myriad contextual factors that may influence an individual patient's management and decision-making-they provide a useful starting point, and should be used pragmatically.

TI Citizens' views on sharing their health data: the role of competence,
   reliability and pursuing the common good
SO BMC MEDICAL ETHICS
LA English
DT Article
ID CONSENT; DESIGN
AB Background In this article, we address questions regarding how people consider what they do or do not consent to and the reasons why. This article presents the findings of a citizen forum study conducted by the University of Geneva in partnership with the Geneva University Hospitals to explore the opinions and concerns of members of the public regarding predictive oncology, genetic sequencing, and cancer. Methods This paper presents the results of a citizen forum that included 73 participants. A research tool titled "the mechanics of consent" was designed for this study. This tool is a table encouraging participants to reflect on social and research actors, types of data, and desired levels of control while sharing different types of data with different actors. Participants' discussion that led to the completion of each table were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis. Results The results are a compilation of responses from the mechanics of consent tool divided into two sections; the first presents quantitative results of collective responses regarding attitudes to consent to donate their data. The second section present qualitative findings emerged from the discussion amongst participants. Discussion Choice and control of personal data is crucial for the public to be able to decide who and how to trust. Key information to be disclosed to potential research participants shall include information about potential risks and benefits; who will be accessing and using their data; as well as assurances that their choice will be respected. Furthermore, researchers ought to make sure they are trustworthy, by acting in a competent, reliable, and honest manner. Governance systems ought to be better equipped to address ethical issues raise by the growing presence of non-traditional research actors, consent of exchanges of data via digital devices and online activity such as social media and fairness of data trading. Finally, informed consent is one of the various elements that contribute to conducting ethical research. More needs to be done to strengthen governance and ensure adequate protection of research participants, particularly to address issues related to predictive health analytics.

ID CRITICAL REALISM; HEALTH; SERVICES; NEEDS
AB Meeting the multiple and often complex needs of families (children, young people and adults) within 'Early Help' support is dependent upon practitioners from different sectors sharing relevant and timely information, after gaining a family's voluntary consent to share information. This article reports on qualitative one-to-one interviews with adults in families (n = 32), one mother/father dyad interview (n = 2) and focus groups with practitioners (n = 47) in five local authority areas in North East England receiving or providing Early Help support. We explored experiences of providing consent to share personal information and consider the usefulness of a digital health data system when providing Early Help support to families. Communication Privacy Management theory was used as a framework to analyse the data. Key themes in participants' accounts include the degree of need for help and support; the importance of trusting relationships; stronger and structured joint working practices; and understanding how information is shared. This work provides insights into current information sharing practices for some of the most vulnerable families and the wider social contexts. It has implications for the usefulness of a digital data system that shares GP health data with Early Help services and suggests the role this could have in the parent-practitioner relationship.
   Early Help support can be provided to children and their families as soon as a problem emerges, to help them overcome the challenges they face. This support is voluntary and for practitioners to share information about a family's circumstances with another organisation, parents are required to give their permission for this to happen. There are several factors that can influence if and how information sharing happens. These factors should be considered when designing new ways of sharing information such as digital data sharing systems.

TI Data quality assessments stimulate improvements to health management
   information systems: evidence from five African countries
SO JOURNAL OF GLOBAL HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
AB Background Health service data are used to inform decisions about planning and implementation, as well as to evaluate performance and outcomes, and the quality of those data are important. Data quality assessments (DQA) afford the opportunity to collect information about health service data. Through its Rapid Access Expansion Programme (RAcE), the World Health Organization (WHO) funded non-governmental organizations (NGO) to support Ministries of Health (MOH) in implementing integrated community case management (iCCM) programs in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Malawi, Mozambique, Niger and Nigeria. WHO contracted ICF to support grantee monitoring and evaluation efforts, part of which was to conduct DQAs to enhance program monitoring and decision making. The contribution of DQAs to data-driven decision making has been documented and the purpose of this paper is to describe how DQAs contributed to health management information system (HMIS) strengthening and the findings of subsequent DQAs in those areas.
   Methods ICF created a mixed-methods DQA for iCCM data, comprising a review of the data collection and management system, a data tracing component and key informant interviews. The DQA was applied twice in each RAcE site, which enables a general comparison of system-level attributes before and after the first DQA application. For this qualitative assessment, we reviewed DQA reports to collate information about DQA recommendations and how they were addressed before a subsequent DQA, along with the findings of the second DQA.
   Results Findings from the first DQA in each RAcE site stimulated NGO and MOH efforts to strengthen different aspects of the HMIS in each country, including modifying data collection tools in the Democratic Republic of Congo; training community health workers (CHWs) and supervisors in Malawi; strengthening supervision in Mozambique; improving CHW registers and strengthening staff capacity at all levels to report data in Niger; establishing a data review system in Abia State, Nigeria; and, establishing processes to improve data use and quality in Niger State, Nigeria.
   Conclusion Data quality assessments stimulated context-specific efforts by NGOs and MOHs to improve iCCM data quality. DQAs can serve as a collaborative and evidence-based activity to influence discussions of data quality and stimulate HMIS strengthening efforts.

AB BackgroundMandates abound to share publicly-funded research data for reuse, while data platforms continue to emerge to facilitate such reuse. Birth cohorts (BC) involve longitudinal designs, significant sample sizes and rich and deep datasets. Data sharing benefits include more analyses, greater research complexity, increased opportunities for collaboration, amplification of public contributions, and reduced respondent burdens. Sharing BC data involves significant challenges including consent, privacy, access policies, communication, and vulnerability of the child. Research on these issues is available for biological data, but these findings may not extend to BC data. We lack consensus on how best to approach these challenges in consent, privacy, communication and autonomy when sharing BC data. We require more stakeholder engagement to understand perspectives and generate consensus.MethodsParents participating in longitudinal birth cohorts completed a web-based survey investigating consent preferences for sharing their, and their child's, non-biological research data. Results from a previous qualitative inquiry informed survey development, and cognitive interviewing methods (n=9) were used to improve the question quality and comprehension. Recruitment was via personalized email, with email and phone reminders during the 14-day window for survey completion.ResultsThree hundred and forty-six of 569 parents completed the survey in September 2014 (60.8%). Participants preferred consent processes for data sharing in future independent research that were less-active (i.e. no consent or opt-out). Parents' consent preferences are associated with their communication preferences. Twenty percent (20.2%) of parents generally agreed that their child should provide consent to continue participating in research at age 12, while 25.6% felt decision-making on sharing non-biological research data should begin at age 18.ConclusionsThese finding reflect the parenting population's preference for less project-specific permission when research data is non-biological and de-identified and when governance practices are highly detailed and rigourous. Parents recognize that children should become involved in consent for secondary data use, but there is variability regarding when and how involvement occurs. These findings emphasize governance processes and participant notification rather than project-specific consent for secondary use of de-identified, non-biological data. Ultimately, parents prefer general consent processes for sharing de-identified, non-biological research data with ultimate involvement of the child.

AB Semi-outdoor space can be used as an alternative to short-term office activities to save office energy consumption and promote a healthy and nature-based working environment. This study evaluated the suitability of semi-outdoor space in four aspects including environmental measurements, physiological measurements, subjective measurements and cognitive performance tests. However, the manual processing and analysis of such multidimensional data can be time-consuming and error-prone. Hence, the objective of this study was to develop a semi-automatic method to manage and analyze the data from different instruments and platforms and two open-source applications (a stroop color and word test and a digit span test) for cognitive performance tests. These codes were critical to the success of the project, providing an effective framework for data extraction, data pre-processing, data analysis and performance tests. Eighty-nine people participated in the experiment of evaluation of thermal comfort, cognitive performance, physiological performance and environmental parameters in semi-outdoor spaces in a tropical setting. Each participant received cognitive tests to assess their selective attention, short-term memory, concentration and creativity quotient. Concurrently, qualitative measurements were conducted to assess thermal sensation, thermal comfort and thermal acceptability. The heart rate, skin temperature, and skin conductance of participants were measured throughout the experiments. Microclimatic variables such as illuminance, noise levels, dry-bulb air temperature, global temperature, relative humidity, air speed, and air direction were monitored simultaneously. To understand the effects of semi-outdoor spaces on participant performance, this study recorded participant performance in different environments through controlled experiments. Data related to participants in different settings include those shared (e.g., environmental measurement), and data unique to each participant (e.g., physiological performance). The results revealed that the subjects' cognitive and physiological performance did not change significantly after switching to the semi-outdoor space due to the availability of natural and mechanical ventilation, suggesting that short-term office activities in the semi-outdoor space are feasible in the tropics.

AB Purpose Rapid advancement of data science has disrupted both business and employees in organizations. However, extant literature primarily focuses on the organizational level phenomena, and has almost ignored the employee/individual perspective. This study thereby intends to capture the experiences of mid-level managers about these disruptions vis a vis their corresponding actions. Design/methodology/approach In a small-sample qualitative research design, Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) was adopted to capture this individual-level phenomenon. Twelve mid-level managers from large-scale Indian organizations that have extensively adopted data science tools and techniques participated in a semi-structured and in-depth interview process. Findings Our findings unfolded several perspectives gained from their experiences, leading thereby to two emergent person-job (mis)fit process models. (1) Managers, who perceived demands-abilities misfit (D-A misfit) as a growth-alignment opportunity vis a vis their corresponding actions, which effectively trapped them into a vicious cycle; and (2) the managers, who considered D-A misfit as a psychological strain vis a vis their corresponding actions, which engaged them into a benevolent cycle. Research limitations/implications The present paper has major theoretical and managerial implications in the field of human resource management and business analytics. Practical implications The findings advise managers that the focus should be on developing an organizational learning eco-system, which would enable mid-level managers to gain their confidence and control over their job and work environment in the context of data science disruptions. Importantly, organizations should facilitate integrated workplace learning (both formal and informal) with an appropriate ecosystem to help mid-level managers to adapt to the data-science disruptions. Originality/value The present study offers two emergent cyclic models to the existing person-job fit literature in the context of data science disruptions. A scant attention of the earlier researchers on how individual employees actually experience disruption, and the corresponding IPA method used in the present study may add significant value to the extant literature. Further, it opens a timely and relevant future research avenues in the context of data science disruptions.

AB In response to the lack of readily available multimedia rich medical knowledge sources to support medical education and patient care, we designed and implemented a web-based video publishing platform. In order to promote the development of high-quality, up-to-date educational content, we have devised a scalable structure that allows online submissions and continuous updating of video and accompanying textual descriptions. Our goal is to enable experts in varied medical domains to collaborate in the construction of a video library using an intuitive web-based interface. Neurologists at Stanford built a well-annotated neurology video collection that initially emphasized childhood and adult movement disorders. The collection may be accessed either as a stand-alone resource or as part of the Stanford Skolar(TM) MD. an integrated online medical knowledge provider. This manuscript discusses the design framework and implementation details of structured media content development. We present examples illustrating media data collection, content indexing using UMLS concepts, media storage, and web presentation.

AB Many marine fish populations have declined due to the individual or cumulative impacts of increasing water temperatures, ocean acidification, overfishing and other human-induced impacts such as land run-off, dredging and habitat alteration. Some solutions may be offered by ecosystem-based fisheries and conservation management. However, understanding their effectiveness relies on the availability of good quality data on the size distributions and abundance of fish populations and assemblages, collected at appropriate temporal and spatial scales. Since the early 2000s, baited remote underwater video systems (BRUVs) have become a popular tool for collecting data on fish assemblages across a range of depths and habitats. In Australia, this technique has been adopted by many different agencies and institutions, creating a unique opportunity to compile a continental-scale synthesis of fish data using a standardised sampling technique. Key Australian researchers and managers were invited to contribute to a synthesis workshop on baited underwater video in Albany, Western Australia between the 4th and 8th of February 2018. Data from 19,939 BRUVs deployments, collected between 2000 and 2017 around Australia, were compiled using GlobalArchive (globalarchive.org). The workshop identified and prioritised several key research themes that would contribute to the conservation and sustainable management of focal species and broad assemblages. Our goal is to describe where and when the data were collected, the type of equipment used and how the imagery was analysed. We also discuss the types of questions that can be addressed by analysing these standardised datasets and the potential benefits to conservation and fisheries management.

ID DATA QUALITY
AB Background: During 2012-2015, the Federal Government of Nigeria launched the Subsidy Reinvestment and Empowerment Programme, a health system strengthening (HSS) programme with a Maternal and Child Health component (Subsidy Reinvestment and Empowerment Programme [SURE-P]/MCH), which was monitored using the Health Management Information Systems (HMIS) data reporting tools. Good quality data is essential for health policy and planning decisions yet, little is known on whether and how broad health systems strengthening programmes affect quality of data. This paper explores the effects of the SURE-P/MCH on completeness of MCH data in the National HMIS. Methods: This mixed-methods study was undertaken in Anambra state, southeast Nigeria. A standardized proforma was used to collect facility-level data from the facility registers on MCH services to assess the completeness of data from 2 interventions and one control clusters. The facility data was collected to cover before, during, and after the SURE-P intervention activities. Qualitative in-depth interviews were conducted with purposefully-identified health facility workers to identify their views and experiences of changes in data quality throughout the above 3 periods.Results: Quantitative analysis of the facility data showed that data completeness improved substantially, starting before SURE-P and continuing during SURE-P but across all clusters (ie, including the control). Also health workers felt data completeness were improved during the SURE-P, but declined with the cessation of the programme. We also found that challenges to data completeness are dependent on many variables including a high burden on providers for data collection, many variables to be filled in the data collection tools, and lack of health worker incentives. Conclusion: Quantitative analysis showed improved data completeness and health workers believed the SURE-P/MCH had contributed to the improvement. The functioning of national HMIS are inevitably linked with other health systems components. While health systems strengthening programmes have a great potential for improved overall systems performance, a more granular understanding of their implications on the specific components such as the resultant quality of HMIS data, is needed.

ID STRATEGIES; OUTCOMES
AB Purpose Student engagement is typically measured by class attendance and questionnaires. Learning management systems (LMS) provide additional sources of objective data that can evaluate student performance. This study compared dental students' self-report of course video viewing with LMS data.
   Methods Dental students in a 2018 flipped pediatric dentistry course were given a questionnaire after course completion that captured self-reported course video viewing. Student data and time spent on videos were extracted from the LMS and matched to the questionnaire. McNemar's test evaluated differences between self-reported and matching LMS data.
   Results Of the 109 enrolled students, 99 (91%) completed the questionnaire. Most students self-reported that they watched more than half of the videos (71%), re-watched at least once (89%), and watched at times other than 8 a.m.-5 p.m. (80%). Of the 104 students with data from the LMS, 40% of students watched more than half of the videos, 49% re-watched at least one video, and 60% watched between 8 a.m.-5 p.m. LMS data showed 14 (13%) students did not watch any videos. Significant differences were found between self-reported video viewing and matched LMS video data in (1) percentage of videos watched, (2) number of times videos were re-watched, and (3) most frequent time for watching the videos (p < 0.001 for all).
   Conclusion Technology is a tool that helps instructors more accurately track students' study habits compared to observation or self-report. When evaluating time spent watching videos via an LMS, students tend to overestimate the amount of viewing time.

AB Background: The use of government health data for secondary purposes, such as monitoring the quality of hospital services, researching the health needs of populations, and testing how well new treatments work, is increasing. This increase in the secondary uses of health data has led to increased interest in what the public thinks about data sharing, in particular, the possibilities of sharing with the private sector for research and development. Although international evidence demonstrates broad public support for the secondary use of health data, this support does not extend to sharing health data with the private sector. If governments intend to share health data with the private sector, knowing what the public thinks will be important. This paper reports a national survey to explore public attitudes in Australia toward sharing health data with private companies for research on and development of therapeutic drugs and medical devices.
   Objective: This study aims to explore public attitudes in Australia toward sharing government health data with the private sector.
   Methods: A web-based survey tool was developed to assess attitudes about sharing government health data with the private sector. A market research company was employed to administer the web-based survey in June 2019.
   Results: The survey was completed by 2537 individuals residing in Australia. Between 51.8% and 57.98% of all participants were willing to share their data, with slightly fewer in favor of sharing to improve health services (51.99%) and a slightly higher proportion in favor of sharing for research and development (57.98%). There was a preference for opt-in consent (53.44%) and broad support for placing conditions on sharing health information with private companies (62% to 91.99%). Wide variability was also observed in participants' views about the extent to which the private sector could be trusted and how well they would behave if entrusted with people's health information. In their qualitative responses, the participants noted concerns about private sector corporate interests, corruption, and profit making and expressed doubt about the Australian government's capacity to manage data sharing safely. The percentages presented are adjusted against the Australian population.
   Conclusions: This nationally representative survey provides preliminary evidence that Australians are uncertain about sharing their health data with the private sector. Although just over half of all the respondents supported sharing health data with the private sector, there was also strong support for strict conditions on sharing data and for opt-in consent and significant concerns about how well the private sector would manage government health data. Addressing public concern about sharing government health data with the private sector will require more and better engagement to build community understanding about how agencies can collect, share, protect, and use their personal data.

TI Research Stakeholders' Views on Benefits and Challenges for Public
   Health Research Data Sharing in Kenya: The Importance of Trust and
   Social Relations
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID EXPERIENCES; PERSPECTIVE; ISSUES
AB Background There is increasing recognition of the importance of sharing research data within the international scientific community, but also of the ethical and social challenges this presents, particularly in the context of structural inequities and varied capacity in international research. Public involvement is essential to building locally responsive research policies, including on data sharing, but little research has involved stakeholders from low-to-middle income countries.
   Methods Between January and June 2014, a qualitative study was conducted in Kenya involving sixty stakeholders with varying experiences of research in a deliberative process to explore views on benefits and challenges in research data sharing. In-depth interviews and extended small group discussions based on information sharing and facilitated debate were used to collect data. Data were analysed using Framework Analysis, and charting flow and dynamics in debates.
   Findings The findings highlight both the opportunities and challenges of communicating about this complex and relatively novel topic for many stakeholders. For more and less research-experienced stakeholders, ethical research data sharing is likely to rest on the development and implementation of appropriate trust-building processes, linked to local perceptions of benefits and challenges. The central nature of trust is underpinned by uncertainties around who might request what data, for what purpose and when. Key benefits perceived in this consultation were concerned with the promotion of public health through science, with legitimate beneficiaries defined differently by different groups. Important challenges were risks to the interests of study participants, communities and originating researchers through stigmatisation, loss of privacy, impacting autonomy and unfair competition, including through forms of intentional and unintentional 'misuse' of data. Risks were also seen for science.
   Discussion Given background structural inequities in much international research, building trust in this low-to-middle income setting includes ensuring that the interests of study participants, primary communities and originating researchers will be promoted as far as possible, as well as protected. Important ways of building trust in data sharing include involving the public in policy development and implementation, promoting scientific collaborations around data sharing and building close partnerships between researchers and government health authorities to provide checks and balances on data sharing, and promote near and long-term translational benefits.

AB Background: Concerns about the confidentiality of personal health information have been identified as a potential obstacle to implementation of Health Information Exchanges (HIEs). Considering the stigma and confidentiality issues historically associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease, we examine how trust-in technology, processes, and people-influenced the acceptability of data sharing among stakeholders prior to implementation of six HIEs intended to improve HIV care in parts of the United States. Our analyses identify the kinds of concerns expressed by stakeholders about electronic data sharing and focus on the factors that ultimately facilitated acceptability of the new exchanges.
   Methods: We conducted 549 surveys with patients and 66 semi-structured interviews with providers and other stakeholders prior to implementation of the HIEs to assess concerns about confidentiality in the electronic sharing of patient data. The patient quantitative data were analyzed using SAS 9.2 to yield sample descriptive statistics. The analysis of the qualitative interviews with providers and other stakeholders followed an open-coding process, and convergent and divergent perspectives emerging from those data were examined within and across the HIEs.
   Results: We found widespread acceptability for electronic sharing of HIV-related patient data through HIEs. This acceptability appeared to be driven by growing comfort with information technologies, confidence in the security protocols utilized to protect data, trust in the providers and institutions who use the technologies, belief in the benefits to the patients, and awareness that electronic exchange represents an enhancement of data sharing already taking place by other means. HIE acceptability depended both on preexisting trust among patients, providers, and institutions and on building consensus and trust in the HIEs as part of preparation for implementation. The process of HIE development also resulted in forging shared vision among institutions.
   Conclusions: Patients and providers are willing to accept the electronic sharing of HIV patient data to improve care for a disease historically seen as highly stigmatized. Acceptability depends on the effort expended to understand and address potential concerns related to data sharing and confidentiality, and on the trust established among stakeholders in terms of the nature of the systems and how they will be used.

DT Article
DE Distraction; Naturalistic driving
AB Information regarding the overall frequency of secondary tasks while driving, as well as individual differences and situational influence on distraction frequency, is needed to understand the impact of distraction on driving behavior. Forty-nine drivers took part in a study that was based on naturalistic driving data and analyzed the frequency of secondary tasks while driving. Two approaches were used to assess secondary task interaction: the analysis of objective data from CAN for the full data set (similar to 370,000 kin) and video analysis for a selected subset of 256 trips (similar to 20,000 km). Results regarding the duration of single secondary tasks and the proportion of driving time spent on the different secondary tasks are reported. Engagement in select secondary tasks (besides interaction with the passenger) was reduced when a passenger was in the car. Moreover, it was observed that especially demanding visual-manual secondary tasks were preferably performed when the car was at standstill and they were avoided when traveling at high speeds on the highway. In closing, the two measurement approaches mentioned above are directly compared and recommendations for future analyses are suggested. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Use of Internet audience measurement data to gauge market share for
   online health information services
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE Internet; World Wide Web; information services; information
   dissemination; audience research; evaluation studies
AB Background: The transition to a largely Internet and Web-based environment for dissemination of health information has changed the health information landscape and the framework for evaluation of such activities. A multidimensional evaluative approach is needed.
   Objective: This paper discusses one important dimension of Web evaluation-usage data. In particular, we discuss the collection and analysis of external data on website usage in order to develop a better understanding of the health information (and related US government information) market space, and to estimate the market share or relative levels of usage for National Library of Medicine (NLM) and National Institutes of Health (NIH) websites compared to other health information providers.
   Methods: The primary method presented is Internet audience measurement based on Web usage by external panels of users and assembled by private vendors-in this case, comScore. A secondary method discussed is Web usage based on Web log software data. The principle metrics for both methods are unique visitors and total pages downloaded per month.
   Results: NLM websites (primarily MedlinePlus and PubMed) account for 55% to 80% of total NIH website usage depending on the metric used. In turn, NIH.gov top-level domain usage (inclusive of NLM) ranks second only behind WebMD in the US domestic home health information market and ranks first on a global basis. NIH.gov consistently ranks among the top three or four US government top-level domains based on global Web usage. On a site-specific basis, the top health information websites in terms of global usage appear to be WebMD, MSN Health, PubMed, Yahoo! Health, AOL Health, and MedlinePlus. Based on MedlinePlus Web log data and external Internet audience measurement data, the three most heavily used cancer-centric websites appear to be www.cancer.gov (National Cancer Institute), www.cancer.org (American Cancer Society), and www.breastcancer.org (non-profit organization).
   Conclusions: Internet audience measurement has proven useful to NLM, with significant advantages compared to sole reliance on usage data from Web log software. Internet audience data has helped NLM better understand the relative usage of NLM and NIH websites in the intersection of the health information and US government information market sectors, which is the primary market intersector for NLM and NIH. However important, Web usage is only one dimension of a complete Web evaluation framework, and other primary research methods, such as online user surveys, usability tests, and focus groups, are also important for comprehensive evaluation that includes qualitative elements, such as user satisfaction and user friendliness, as well as quantitative indicators of website usage.

AB In this article, we discuss the application of a data analysis method used in a feminist study that explored the working world of nursing unit managers in Australia. The decision to use a voice-centered relational approach to the data was based on a desire to delve into the working world of nursing unit managers and uncover the layers within the narratives that specifically related to their perceptions of themselves, their world, and the context in which they work. Throughout this article, the focus is on how this method was applied to uncover multiple layers of meaning within the data, rather than on the researchers' and participants' roles in the coconstruction of interview data. An excerpt from an interview transcript is used to illustrate how the stories of the participants were explored using this method.

AB Naturalistic driving research shows that drivers spend vast amounts of time engaging in secondary, non-driving tasks. Laboratory and simulation studies have demonstrated that, when engaging in a secondary task, drivers adopt strategies to interrupt, delay and resume the secondary task in order to manage their workload and risk. However, there is very little knowledge of the time-sharing strategies that drivers adopt for interweaving their attention across multiple tasks in real-world driving. This study examined the nature of observable visual and/or manual secondary task interruptions in real-word driving using naturalistic driving data. Video of 186 randomly selected trips from the Australian Naturalistic Driving Study were viewed to identify a range of secondary tasks and whether, when and why drivers interrupted engagement in these secondary tasks. It was found that under everyday naturalistic driving conditions, drivers interrupt (or temporarily disengage from) only a small percentage (13.5%) of the secondary tasks engaged in, with 87 percent of these tasks interrupted to re-engage in the driving task. The number of interruptions made to secondary tasks was found to differ according to a number of task characteristics, including task duration and visual load, with tasks of longer duration and higher visual load more likely to be interrupted. The results have a range of practical implications, particularly for the design of invehicle devices that better support drivers to break down long tasks into a series of sub-tasks, so that they can more easily disengage when driving demands necessitate.

ID SAMPLE
AB IMPORTANCE Using social media to recruit participants is a common and cost-effective practice. Willingness to participate (WTP) in biomedical research is a function of trust in the scientific team, which is closely tied to the source of funding and institutional connections.
   OBJECTIVE To determine whether WTP and willingness to share social media data are associated with the type of research team and online recruitment platform.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This mixed-methods longitudinal survey and qualitative study was conducted over 2 points (T1 and T2) using Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) platform. Participants were US adults aged 18 years or older who use at least 1 social media platform. Recruitment was stratified to match race/ethnicity proportions of the 2010 US Census. The volunteer sample consisted of 914 participants at T1, and 655 participants completed the follow-up survey 5 months later (T2).
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Outcomes were (1) past experience with online research and sharing social media data for research; (2) WTP in research advertised online; (3) WTP in a study sponsored by a pharmaceutical company, a university, or a federal agency; and (4) willingness to share social media data. Opinions were solicited regarding the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation statute, which came into effect between T1 and T2.
   RESULTS Of 914 participants completing the first survey (T1), 604 (66.1%) were aged 18 to 39 years and 494 (54.0%) were female. Of these, 655 participants (71.7%) responded at T2. While 680 participants (74.4%) indicated WTP in biomedical research, only 454 (49.3%) were willing to share their social media data. Participants were significantly less likely to participate in federally sponsored (odds ratio [OR], 0.58; 95% CI, 0.51-0.64; P <.001) or pharmaceutical company (OR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.53-0.66; P <.001) research than university-led studies. They were also less likely to share their social medial data for federal (OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.58-0.72; P <.001) or pharmaceutical company (OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.44-0.56; P <.001) research compared with academic studies. Willingness to participate in pharmaceutical company-led research decreased 11.89% from T1 to T2 (OR for T2, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.54-0.77; P <.001). Reasons for WTP were interest in furthering science, financial incentives, trust in the organization, and data security. While 63.0% of respondents reported seeing new privacy policy emails related to the General Data Protection Regulation law, only 27.1% indicated this positively influenced their WTP. Thematic analysis of responses indicated that WTP may improve with stronger data security measures.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study suggests that researchers may see reduced online research participation and data sharing, particularly for research conducted outside academia.

AB Background: Technological advances have radically changed the opportunities for individuals with chronic conditions to practice self-care and to coproduce health care and research. Digital technologies enable patients to perform tasks traditionally carried out by health care professionals in a more convenient way, at lower costs, and without compromising quality. Patients may also share real-world data with other stakeholders to promote individual and population health. However, there is a need for legal frameworks that enable patient privacy and control in such sharing of real-world data. We believe that this need could be met by the conceptualization of patient-controlled real-world data as knowledge commons, which is a resource shared by a group of people.
   Objective: This study aimed to propose a conceptual model that describes how patient-controlled real-world data can be shared effectively in chronic care management, in a way that supports individual and population health, while respecting personal data privacy and control.
   Methods: An action research approach was used to develop a solution to enable patients, in a self-determined way, to share patient-controlled data to other settings. We chose the context of cystic fibrosis (CF) care in Sweden, where coproduction between patients, their families, and health care professionals is critical in the introduction of new drugs. The first author, who is a lawyer and parent of children with CF, was a driver in the change process. All coauthors collaborated in the analysis. We collected primary and secondary data reflecting changes during the time period from 2012 to 2020, and performed a qualitative content analysis guided by the knowledge commons framework.
   Results: Through a series of changes, a national system for enabling patients to share patient-controlled real-world data to different stakeholders in CF care was implemented. The case analysis resulted in a conceptual model consisting of the following three knowledge commons arenas that contributed to patient-controlled real-world data collection, use, and sharing: (1) patient world arena involving the private sphere of patients and families; (2) clinical microsystem arena involving the professional sphere at frontline health care clinics; and (3) round table arena involving multiple stakeholders from different settings. Based on the specification of property rights, as presented in our model, the patient can keep control over personal health information and may grant use rights to other stakeholders.
   Conclusions: Health information exchanges for sharing patient-controlled real-world data are pivotal to enable patients, health care professionals, health care funders, researchers, authorities, and the industry to coproduce high-quality care and to introduce and follow-up novel health technologies. Our model proposes how technical and legal structures that protect the integrity and self-determination of patients can be implemented, which may be applicable in other chronic care settings as well.

AB Vision-based trajectory data provides great details for investigating microscopic behavior and road safety at the level of interactions. Most studies investigating pedestrian-vehicle interactions at non-signalized intersections have focused on interactions at the crosswalk on the same approach where the vehicle is coming from, which are referred to as primary interactions in this study. However, secondary interactions, defined as interactions between vehicles exiting the intersection and crossing pedestrians, have not been adequately studied. Second interactions can pose more dangers to pedestrians due to the driver's unclear knowledge of right-of-way, acceleration attempts to recover the speed, and the complex situation the driver faces in the intersection. This paper aims at studying the safety issue of secondary pedestrian-vehicle interactions at non-signalized intersections. For that purpose, a methodology is proposed based on surrogate measures of safety and behavioral measures derived from vision-based trajectories. This methodology is implemented through a case study involving ten all-way stop intersections from Montreal, Canada. Road user trajectory data are automatically extracted from the videos. Different measures are used in the study: from the interaction analysis that determines vehicle-pedestrian interactions based on a Distance-Velocity (DV) model, average crossing speeds and vehicle approaching behaviors in terms of speed and acceleration. Computer tools are developed to extract these measures from the trajectory data. Based on these measures, a comparative analysis is carried out between primary and secondary interactions. Results show that secondary interactions are more dangerous than primary interactions. Among the three secondary interaction types, secondary through interactions are the most dangerous.

AB Data analytics is transforming our global markets and significantly impacting the financial reporting environment. We investigate how auditors, company managers, and regulation interact with data analytics and one another to affect the diffusion (i.e., development and spread) of data analytics throughout the financial reporting environment. We interview company managers and their audit partners, as well as additional stakeholders, including regulators. We interpret findings from our interviews using theory that highlights the importance of dynamic interactions between people and their environments, which include the prevailing rules (e.g., regulatory guidance). Our findings contribute to the accounting literature and practice by revealing three areas of conflict emerging from stakeholders' disparate preferences for data analytics. First, we uncover growing tensions between managers and audit partners regarding audit fees. Second, we find that managers and auditors believe the lack of accounting regulation specific to data analytics causes confusion and frustration. Finally, auditors report that they strategically leverage data analytics to provide clients with business-related insights. However, regulators voice concerns that this practice might impair auditor independence and reduce audit quality. These areas of conflict suggest a need to revisit key tensions surrounding the audit function in a contemporary context characterized with significant technological shift.

AB Widespread sharing of data and materials (including displays and text- and video-based descriptions of experimental procedures) will improve the reproducibility of psychological science and accelerate the pace of discovery. In this article, we discuss some of the challenges to open sharing and offer practical solutions for researchers who wish to share more of the products-and process-of their research. Many of these solutions were devised by the Databrary .org data library for storing and sharing video, audio, and other forms of sensitive or personally identifiable data. We also discuss ways in which researchers can make shared data and materials easier for others to find and reuse. Widely adopted, these solutions and practices will increase transparency and speed progress in psychological science.

AB Problem: Some evidence exists that drivers choose to engage in secondary tasks when the driving demand is low (e.g., when the car is stopped). While such a behavior might generally be considered as rather safe, it could be argued that the associated diversion of attention away from the road still leads to a reduction of situational awareness, which might increase collision risk once the car regains motion. This is especially relevant for texting, which is associated with considerable eyes-off-the-road-time. Nonetheless, it seems that previous research has barely addressed the actual engagement in secondary tasks while waiting at a red light (as compared to just addressing the tasks' mere prevalence). Objective: The present study investigated secondary task engagement while stopped at a red light using European naturalistic driving data collected through the UDRIVE project. Attention was given to the whole engagement process, including simple prevalence and the tasks' relation (in terms of start/end) to the red light period. Moreover, given that texting is one of the most problematic forms of distraction, it was characterized in more detail regarding glance behavior. Method: Videos of 804 red light episodes from 159 drivers were annotated. Glance behavior was also coded for a sub-set of 75 texting events and their matched baselines. Results, conclusions and practical applications: Drivers engaged in at least one secondary task across almost half of the annotated red light episodes. Drivers who texted while stopped spent most of the time looking at their cell phone. Consequently, drivers might not have been prepared for potentially unexpected events once the light turned green. Further, drivers concluded texting a considerable number of times well after the red light period, which has potential implications for traffic safety.

AB Using naturalistic driving data, this study explored the prevalence of engagement in secondary tasks whilst driving through intersections, and investigated whether drivers manage and self-regulate such behaviour in response to variations in roadway and environmental conditions. Video recordings of in-vehicle and external scenes were coded for precisely defined categories of secondary tasks and related contextual variables. The findings indicated that nearly one-quarter of the total driving time at intersections was spent on secondary activities and that lower engagement occurred within intersections compared to phases immediately upstream or downstream. Drivers were less likely to occupy themselves with secondary tasks when their vehicles were moving than when they were stationary. Elderly drivers showed less inclination to perform secondary tasks than did younger drivers. Lastly, drivers tended to perform secondary tasks less frequently at intersections managed by traffic signs than those controlled by traffic lights, when they did not have priority compared to when they had priority, and in adverse weather conditions compared to fine weather conditions. In conclusion, drivers appeared to self-regulate secondary task engagement in response to roadway and environmental conditions. Specifically, they exercised self-regulation by reducing their secondary task engagement when the driving task was more challenging. The findings from this study provide preliminary evidence for targeting the education and training of drivers and media campaigns related to safe driving strategies and managing distractions.

AB Increasingly, management researchers are using topic modeling, a new method borrowed from computer science, to reveal phenomenon-based constructs and grounded conceptual relationships in textual data. By conceptualizing topic modeling as the process of rendering constructs and conceptual relationships from textual data, we demonstrate how this new method can advance management scholarship without turning topic modeling into a black box of complex computer-driven algorithms. We begin by comparing features of topic modeling to related techniques (content analysis, grounded theorizing, and natural language processing). We then walk through the steps of rendering with topic modeling and apply rendering to management articles that draw on topic modeling. Doing so enables us to identify and discuss how topic modeling has advanced management theory in five areas: detecting novelty and emergence, developing inductive classification systems, understanding online audiences and products, analyzing frames and social movements, and understanding cultural dynamics. We conclude with a review of new topic modeling trends and revisit the role of researcher interpretation in a world of computer-driven textual analysis.

AB The continuously growing amount of available data has accelerated the emergence of numerous business intelligence applications that are summarized under the term Big Data Analytics (BDA). BDA is especially relevant to the domain of Supply Chain Management (SCM) as it provides the tools to support decision-making in increasingly global, volatile and dynamic value networks. However, its application challenges traditional institutional arrangements as well as roles that are related to the management of data. The underlying empirical study addresses this challenge with the application of a multi-method approach that is embedded in Organizational Information Processing Theory (OIPT). A Delphi survey was conducted to integrate expert assessments of projections up to the year 2035 and fuzzy c-means clustering was applied to identify future scenarios that span the future of BDA in SCM. The study suggests that BDA will improve demand forecasts, reduce safety stocks and improve the management of supplier performance. However, supply chain (SC) processes will become increasingly automated and traditional tasks of SCM will be partially substituted as a result. Consequently, the transition of the traditional role of SCM within organizations will increase the importance of human intuition, trust and strategic decision-making.

AB Objective Functional evaluations establish functional and work (in-)capacities in the context of disability assessments and are increasingly recommended as a modern technique for work disability assessments. The RELY (Reliable disabilityEvaLuation in psychiatrY)-studies introduced semi-structured functional interviews in real-life assessments of claimants with mental disorders for evaluating their self-perceived health-related limitations and for investigating the reproducibility of work capacity (WC) estimates. Functional interviews elicit claimants' self-perceptions about their work-related limitations and capacities in the labour market. This secondary data analysis explored the coverage of work-related key topics in these interviews and investigated whether interviews with high coverage (versus low coverage) of work-related topics resulted in better reproducibility of WC estimates among experts. Methods Thirty video-taped RELY-assessments underwent a content analysis along a predefined framework for functional interviewing, including the claimant's self-perceived work limitations and work-related health complaints as centrepieces of functional interviewing. Following transcription, interviews were segmented into coding units. Coding units were allocated to the five steps with 19 key topics of the framework. Enquiry into key topics was ascertained by summing the functional coding units per key topic. Median split grouped the interviews into high and low coverage of functional topics and compared them for inter-rater reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC) and inter-rater agreement (standard error of measurement, SEM). Results Interviews were broken down in 40,010 coding units, 31% of which addressed functional topics. Enquiries in self-perceived work limitations and work-related health complaints were sparse (coding units median(psychiatrist)between 0 and 1.5, median(patients)between 0 and 9.5). High coverage interviews enquired on more functional topics (68% vs. 42%, chi(2)(1, N = 38) = 5.32, p = 0.021) and in more depth (36% vs. 16% of functional coding units, chi(2)(1, N = 1,314) = 141.15, p < 0.001). Interviews with higher functional coverage reached significantly higher inter-rater agreement in WC ratings among experts (mean difference in SEM, low-high coverage, 7.5% WC, 95% CI 0.2 to 15.1%WC). Inter-rater reliability was low in both groups (ICC, 0.38 versus 0.40). Conclusions Content analysis showed little enquiry by experts on claimants' self-perceived activity limitations and work-related capacity. The association between interviews with higher functional coverage and better expert agreement on the claimants' remaining WC requires confirmation in prospective studies.

   DISCLOSURE; INTERNET; RISK; CONFIDENTIALITY; WILLINGNESS; COVERAGE
AB Smartphone sensors allow measurement of phenomena that are difficult or impossible to capture via self-report (e.g., geographical movement, physical activity). Sensors can reduce respondent burden by eliminating survey questions and improve measurement accuracy by replacing/augmenting self-reports. However, if respondents who are not willing to collect sensor data differ on critical attributes from those who are, the results can be biased. Research on the mechanisms of willingness to collect sensor data mostly comes from (nonprobability) online panels and is hypothetical (i.e., asks participants about the likelihood of participation in a sensor-based study). In a cross-sectional general population randomized experiment, we investigate how features of the request and respondent characteristics influence willingness to share (WTS) and actually sharing smartphone-sensor data. We manipulate the request to either mention or not mention (1) how participation will benefit the participant, (2) participants' autonomy over data collection, and (3) that data will be kept confidential. We assess nonparticipation bias using the administrative records. WTS and actually sharing varies by sensor task, participants' autonomy over data sharing, their smartphone skills, level of privacy concerns, and attitudes toward surveys. Fewer people agree to share photos and a video than geolocation, but all who agreed to share photos or a video actually did. Some nonresponse and nonparticipation biases are substantial and make each other worse, but others jointly reduce the overall bias. Our findings suggest that sensor-data-sharing decisions depend on sample members' situation when asked to share and the nature of the sensor task rather than the sensor type.

AB Objective To describe real-world practices and variation in implementation of the Information Blocking provisions amongst healthcare organizations caring for pediatric patients.Materials and methods An online survey regarding implementation practices was distributed to representatives from 10 participating US healthcare organizations located in 6 different states. The survey was followed by structured interviews conducted through video conference. Information was gathered about implementation practices at each organization, with a focus on patient and proxy portal access to, and segmentation capabilities of, certain data classes listed in the United States Core Data for Interoperability Version 1.Results All organizations had implemented the information blocking provisions at their institution. All organizations utilized different portal account types for proxies and users. All organizations reported the capability of sharing labs, medications, problem lists, imaging, and notes with the parent/guardian of the non-adolescent minor user with differences in how sensitive elements within the data classes were protected. Variability existed in how data was shared with the remaining user types.Discussion Significant variability exists in how organizations have implemented the information blocking rules. Variation in data sharing and data access between institutions can result in privacy breaches and create confusion about completeness of data for patients and families.Conclusion Healthcare organizations have utilized varying strategies to comply with the information blocking provisions of the 21st Century Cures Act. Increased clarity from the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology on minor, adolescent, and caregiver privacy and improved segmentation capabilities from Electronic Health Record vendors is needed.

ID MANUAL PAVEMENT DISTRESS
AB Transportation infrastructure assets are among the largest investments made by governmental agencies. These agencies use data on asset conditions to make decisions regarding the timing of maintenance activities, the type of treatment, and the resources to employ. To collect and record these data, agencies often utilize trained evaluators who assess the asset either on site or by analyzing photos and/or videos. These visual assessments are widely used to evaluate conditions of various assets, including pavement surface distresses. This paper describes a Data Quality Assessment & Improvement Framework (DQAIF) to measure and improve the performance of multiple evaluators of pavement distresses by controlling for subjective judgment by the individual evaluators. The DQAIF is based on a continuous quality improvement cyclic process that is based on the following main components: (1)assessment of the consistency over timeperformed using linear regression analysis; (2)assessment of the agreement between evaluatorsperformed using inter-rater agreement analysis; and (3)implementation of management practices to improve the results shown by the assessments. A large and comprehensive case study was employed to describe, refine, and validate the framework. When the DQAIF is applied to pavement distress data collected on site by different evaluators, the results show that it is an effective method for quickly identifying and solving data collection issues. The benefit of this framework is that the analyses employed produce performance measures during the data collection process, thus minimizing the risk of subjectivity and suggesting timely corrective actions. The DQAIF can be used as part of an asset management program, or in any engineering program in which the data collected are subjected to the judgment of the individuals performing the evaluation. The process could also be adapted for assessing performance of automated distress data acquisition systems.

AB Purpose - Print theses and dissertations have regularly been submitted together with complementary material, such as maps, tables, speech samples, photos or videos, in various formats and on different supports. In the digital environment of open repositories and open data, these research results could become a rich source of research results and data sets, for reuse and other exploitation. The paper aims to discuss these issues.
   Design/methodology/approach - After introducing electronic theses and dissertations (ETD) into the context of eScience, the paper investigates some aspects that impact the availability and openness of data sets and other supplemental files related to ETD (system architecture, metadata and data retrieval, legal aspects).
   Findings - These items are part of the so-called "small data" of eScience, with a wide range of contents and formats. Their heterogeneity and their link to ETD need specific approaches to data curation and management, with specific metadata and identifiers and with specific services, workflows and systems. One size may not fit for all but it seems appropriate to separate text and data files. Regarding copyright and licensing, data sets must be evaluated carefully but should not be processed and disseminated under the same conditions as the related PhD theses. Some examples are presented.
   Research limitations/implications - The paper concludes with recommendations for further investigation and development to foster open access to research results produced along with PhD theses.
   Originality/value - ETDs are an important part of the content of open repositories. Yet, their potential as a gateway to underlying research results has not really been explored so far.

AB Purpose Taking the COVID-19 as the background, this study aims to investigate the direct influencing factors regarding knowledge sharing behavior (KSB) on new media platforms and discuss how the characteristics of the users could enhance the KSB through moderation effect, and provide empirical evidences. Design/methodology/approach Based on the social exchange theory and after the text analysis of the data collected from the Tiktok platform in 2020, this paper uses the quantitative method to evaluate the factors influence KSB on short video social platform during the COVID-19 outbreak. Findings KSB on new media platform could be enhanced by richer knowledge content of the video posted and the attribute of the platform users directly. Platform users could affect the trustworthiness of the knowledge shared, thus influence the knowledge sharing. On the early stage of the COVID-19, the richer content of the knowledge released by users could effectively enhance the KSB. On the early stage of the emergency events, the official users could play a significant role on KS. During the mitigation stage of COVID-19, the KSB of the knowledge shared by unofficial users with richer content could be enhanced and the moderation effect is relatively stronger. Originality/value The research extends the social exchange theory to a disaster management context. The authors provide an effective reference for future governments to effectively cope with the epidemic and spread public knowledge in an emergency response context. By analyzing the influence of knowledge content and influencer characteristics, it could help the social media platform to improve content management and optimize resource allocation.

AB Ethnographic research consists of multiple methodological approaches, including short- and/or long-term participant observation, interviews, photographs, videos, and group field work, to name a few. Yet, it is commonly practiced as a solitary endeavor and primary data is not often subject to scholarly scrutiny. In this paper, I suggest a model in which to understand the different ways in which ethnographies can be transparent - naming places, naming people, and sharing data - and the varied decisions ethnographers have made with regard to them: whether to name a region, city or specific neighborhood, name primary participants or public officials, and to share interview guides, transcripts, or different kinds of field notes. In doing so, this paper highlights how decisions regarding transparency are part of an ethnographer's methodological toolkit, and should be made on a case-by-case basis depending on the who, what, where, when and why of our research.

AB oLa infraestructura del transporte es una de las mas grandes inversiones que realizan los gobiernos. Las agencias gubernamentales de transporte administran este capital y utilizan la informacion de las condiciones de este para decidir la programacion y tipo de mantenimiento y recursos a ejercer. Para recolectar la informacion pertinente, las agencias emplean evaluadores adiestrados para evaluar la infraestructura, ya sea en sitio o analizando fotografias y/o videos. Las evaluaciones visuales son empleadas para inspeccionar las condiciones de la infraestructura, incluyendo el desgaste de la superficie de los caminos y carreteras. Este articulo describe un Data Quality Assessment & Improvement Framework (DQAIF) (Sistema de Evaluacion y Mejora de la Calidad de la Informacion) para medir y controlar los datos de los evaluadores del deterioro de carreteras, al controlar el criterio de estos. El DQAIF es en un proceso ciclico de Mejora Continua de Calidad compuesto por: a)la evaluacion del nivel de acuerdo entre evaluadores -por medio del analisis estadistico (inter-rater agreement analysis), b)la evaluacion de la consistencia a traves del tiempo -mediante analisis de regresion lineal, y c)la implementacion de practicas gerenciales para mejorar los resultados mostrados en las evaluaciones anteriores. Se llevo a cabo un estudio de caso para validar el sistema propuesto. Los resultados mostraron que el DQAIF es efectivo para identificar y resolver problemas de la calidad de los datos obtenidos en las inspecciones de infraestructura. Con este sistema se garantiza la reduccion del riesgo de la subjetividad y asi aplicar acciones de mantenimiento mas oportunas. El DQAIF puede ser empleado en un programa de gerencia de infraestructura o en cualquier programa de ingenieria en donde la informacion esta sujeta al juicio o criterio personal de los individuos que realizan la evaluacion. Este proceso puede ser adaptado, incluso, para evaluar el desempeno de sistemas automatizados de evaluacion de pavimentos.

TI Anesthetic preoperative consultation: Information gathering management
   and role of the data selected on anesthesia process planning

ID BEHAVIOR; ERRORS
AB Anesthesia is a highly dynamic process, characterized by some specific features such as uncertainty, high speed, time pressure, vital risks (the patient's life is at stake). Moreover, in the anesthetic process, the conditions change rapidly and the task is frequently interrupted. Several studies (Gaba, 1994; Xiao, Milgram, & Doyle, 1997a, b) have demonstrated the importance of preoperative preparation tasks. In the present study, we focused on preliminary planning activities by studying the strategies for information gathering and the notation of the selected data. ne anesthetists' major aim during this preoperative phase is to assess the risks of the anesthesia for the patient and to anticipate for potential problems. During the consultation, the anesthetists exhaustively scan the patient's medical framework via the medical interview and the clinical examination, and the data collected are written down on a one-page paper sheet, which is Part of the anesthetic record. According to French new legal recommendations, this anesthetic record should be typewritten. To deal with this requirement, several types of software have been developed to handle medical information gathering and recording during the preoperative phase. We used such a prototype, named Anesthesia Mobile System (AMS). We then compared the anesthetists' strategies for collecting relevant medical information in the two situations : one-page paper sheet and AMS. All the consultations were videotaped and we performed autofacing interviews. We recorded the duration of the consultations, the fields and domains investigated and completed, the data collected and recorded, the type of notation used. We then described the patient/anesthetist dialogs via diagrams connecting the anesthetists' questions, the patients' answers and the resulting recorded data.
   The results suggest that the anesthetists can use three strategies to gather information (i) they can question the patient following the standard order set by the paper file; (ii) from an information given by the patient, they can identify some significant pattern and rely on this inference to seek further specific information, and (iii) sometimes, they allow the patient to "tell his/her story". ne anesthetists can alternate those strategies during the consultation, each one weighing more or less depending on the complexity of the medical case. The mixed utilization of these three strategies plays one main function : It allows the anesthetists to elaborate a proper representation of the medical case, via an of "opportunistic" information gathering. Among the information provided by the patients, the anesthetists select relevant data allowing them to characterize and categorize the medical case and to ground the decision for the anesthesia itself. The recorded data can be either raw information or interpreted items which contain elements for planning the anesthetic process and information allowing the assessment of the plan and its adjustment during the surgery, according to the patient's physiological status. The comparison of data gathering and recording with the paper file and with the computer shows important differences : With the computerized record, the consultation lasts six times longer, more data are recorded but some of these data are less relevant and, conversely, some essential data are not present. Due to some characteristics of the AMS, interface, the alternation of strategies for information gathering becomes impossible, and the users are constrained to adopt the systematic order set by the interface, which is close to the structure of the paper sheet. This constraint stiffens the dialog patient/anesthetist, that becomes very,formal, and interferes with the elaboration of the representation of the medical case. This negative interference is reinforced by the fact that the anesthetists cannot have before their eyes all the information already recorded while they go on with the medical interview. The results are discussed and particularly for their implications on the specification of software to handle medical information gathering

AB Social Networking Services (SNSs) connect people worldwide, where they communicate through sharing contents, photos, videos, posting their first-hand opinions, comments, and following their friends. Social networks are characterized by velocity, volume, value, variety, and veracity, the 5 V's of big data. Hence, big data analytic techniques and frameworks are commonly exploited in Social Network Analysis (SNA). By the ever-increasing growth of social networks, the analysis of social data, to describe and find communication patterns among users and understand their behaviors, has attracted much attention. In this paper, we demonstrate how big data analytics meets social media, and a comprehensive review is provided on big data analytic approaches in social networks to search published studies between 2013 and August 2020, with 74 identified papers. The findings of this paper are presented in terms of main journals/conferences, yearly distributions, and the distribution of studies among publishers. Furthermore, the big data analytic approaches are classified into two main categories: Content-oriented approaches and network-oriented approaches. The main ideas, evaluation parameters, tools, evaluation methods, advantages, and disadvantages are also discussed in detail. Finally, the open challenges and future directions that are worth further investigating are discussed.

AB We present GlassesViewer, open-source software for viewing and analyzing eye-tracking data of the Tobii Pro Glasses 2 head-mounted eye tracker as well as the scene and eye videos and other data streams (pupil size, gyroscope, accelerometer, and TTL input) that this headset can record. The software provides the following functionality written in MATLAB: (1) a graphical interface for navigating the study- and recording structure produced by the Tobii Glasses 2; (2) functionality to unpack, parse, and synchronize the various data and video streams comprising a Glasses 2 recording; and (3) a graphical interface for viewing the Glasses 2's gaze direction, pupil size, gyroscope and accelerometer time-series data, along with the recorded scene and eye camera videos. In this latter interface, segments of data can furthermore be labeled through user-provided event classification algorithms or by means of manual annotation. Lastly, the toolbox provides integration with the GazeCode tool by Benjamins et al. (2018), enabling a completely open-source workflow for analyzing Tobii Pro Glasses 2 recordings.

ID 4TH-AMENDMENT; PRIVACY
AB Today, information is shared almost constantly. People share their DNA to track their ancestry or for individualized health information; they instruct Alexa to purchase products or provide directions; and, now more than ever, they use videoconferencing technology in their homes. According to the third-party doctrine, the government can access all such information without a warrant or without infringing on Fourth Amendment privacy protections. This exposure of vast amounts of highly personal data to government intrusion is permissible because the Supreme Court has interpreted the third-party doctrine as a per se rule. However, that interpretation rests on an improper understanding of the reasonable expectation of privacy standard developed in Katz v. United States.
   There is a solution. A close reading of Katz's logic can reorient third-party analysis from a per se rule to a tailored test of the knowledge of the sharer and the nature of the recipient, asking whether the sharer (1) knowingly exposed information (2) to the public. This interpretation allows the Fourth Amendment to better evolve with changing technology, such that the exception no longer risks swallowing the rule.

AB Background: The process of informed consent in National Institutes of Health randomized, placebo-controlled trials is poorly studied. There are several issues regarding informed consent in emergency neurologic trials, including a shared decision-making process with the patient or a legally authorized representative about overall risks, benefits, and alternative treatments.
   Methods: To evaluate the informed consent process, we collected best and worst informed consent practice information from a National Institutes of Health trial and used this in medical simulation videos to educate investigators at multiple sites to improve the consent process. Clot Lysis: Evaluating Accelerated Resolution of Intraventricular Hemorrhage Phase III (CLEAR III) (clinicaltrials.gov, NCT00784134) studied the effect of intraventricular alteplase (n = 251) versus saline (placebo) injections (n = 249) for intraventricular hemorrhage reduction. Reasons for ineligibility (including refusing to consent) for all screen failures were analyzed. The broadcasted presentation outlined best practices for doctor-patient interactions during the consenting process, as well as anecdotal, study-specific reasons for consent refusal. Best and worst consent elements were then incorporated into a simulation video to enhance the informed consent process. This video was disseminated to trial sites as a webinar around the midpoint of the trial to improve the consent process. Pre- and post-intervention consent refusals were compared.
   Results: During the trial, 10,538 patients were screened for eligibility, of which only three were excluded due to trial timing. Pre-intervention, 77 of 5686 (1.40%) screen eligible patients or their proxies refused consent. Post-intervention, 55 of 4849 (1.10%) refused consent, which was not significantly different from pre-intervention (P = 0.312). The incidence of screen failures was significantly lower post-intervention (P = 0.006), possibly due to several factors for patient exclusion.
   Conclusion: The informed consent process for prospective randomized trials may be enhanced by studying and refining best practices based on trial-specific plans and patient concerns particular to a study.

AB The emergence of extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) raises the opportunity to explore the role of endorphin blockade on hedonic response during long-term alcohol dependence treatment. A hedonic survey was administered to 74 alcohol dependent patients treated for an average of 3.5 years with nearly continuous month-long intramuscular XR-NTX. The paper-and-pencil, one-time survey asked patients about the degree of pleasure they experienced in the past 90 days with drinking alcohol, sex, exercise and other daily activities. The data revealed lower pleasure ratings for alcohol than for sex, exercise and 10 other common activities. Mean responses to drinking alcohol and gambling were significantly lower than to listening to music, sex, reading, being with friends, eating good food, eating spicy food, and playing video/card games. This effect was independent of XR-NTX dose or duration. Although this exploratory study lacked baseline data, a comparison group or control for the impact of patient discontinuation, the data indicate the feasibility of examining long-term hedonic response in recovery. The differential hedonic ratings suggest that, in patients who persist with long-term continuous therapy, XR-NTX may selectively inhibit the pleasure associated with drinking alcohol, compared to a variety of other activities.

ID FULLY DOCUMENTED FISHERIES; LANDING OBLIGATION
AB Electronic Monitoring (EM) with video is a tool often mentioned to ensure compliance with fishing regulations while vessels are at sea. Since 2008, several trials have been conducted in the European Union on the use of EM. One of the largest and longest running European trials was the 2010-2016 Cod Catch Quota Management trial (CCQM) in Denmark. This paper reviews the methods and experiences gained from this trial, with focus on the last two years where criteria for video audits were expanded and major technical developments took place. The cost-effectiveness and potential of EM for compliance, management and scientific purposes is discussed. The present study demonstrates that EM is capable of high precision detection of non-compliance with a discard ban and that developments in the transmission of EM data allowed for a smoother and more reliable Monitoring, Control and Surveillance (MCS) system. Although further developments are needed, especially within the field of automated image analysis, we conclude that EM is one of the few feasible tools where fisheries information and compliance can be ensured under a Landing Obligation.

AB Aims To estimate the volume of past-year televised alcohol advertising exposure by product category and demographic group among adults living in the United States and test associations between estimated alcohol advertising exposure and past 30-day drinking behavior.
   Design Secondary analysis of data from two national-level US data sets: Kantar data on appearances of televised alcohol advertisements and data from the Simmons National Consumer Survey (NCS), a large national mail survey on television viewing patterns and consumer behavior.
   Setting United States.
   Participants A total of 54 671 adults, aged 21 years and older, who were randomly selected to participate in the Simmons NCS.
   Measurements Estimated exposure to televised advertisements for beer, wine and spirits, self-reported alcohol use in the past year and number of drinks consumed in the past 30 days.
   Findings The average respondent was exposed to an estimated 576 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 570-582] televised alcohol advertisements in the year preceding their survey. Exposure was higher among males versus females and African Americans versus whites. A 1% increase in the estimated volume of advertisement exposure was associated with a 0.11 (95% CI = 0.08-0.13) percentage point increase in the odds of having at least one drink in the last 30 days and, among past 30-day drinkers, a 0.05 (95% CI = 0.04-0.07) per cent increase in the number of alcoholic drinks consumed. Associations were consistent across product categories and demographics.
   Conclusions There appears to be a small but consistent positive association between alcohol advertising exposure and drinking behavior among American adults.

AB Background Shared decision making (SDM) facilitates delivery of medical therapies that are in alignment with patients' goals and values. Medicare national coverage decision for several interventions now includes SDM mandates, but few have been evaluated in nationwide studies. Based upon a detailed needs assessment with diverse stakeholders, we developed pamphlet and video patient decision aids (PtDAs) for implantable cardioverter/defibrillator (ICD) implantation, ICD replacement, and cardiac resynchronization therapy with defibrillation to help patients contemplate, forecast, and deliberate their options. These PtDAs are the foundation of the Multicenter Trial of a Shared Decision Support Intervention for Patients Offered Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators (DECIDE-ICD), a multicenter, randomized trial sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute aimed at understanding the effectiveness and implementation of an SDM support intervention for patients considering ICDs. Finalization of a Medicare coverage decision mandating the inclusion of SDM for new ICD implantation occurred shortly after trial initiation, raising novel practical and statistical considerations for evaluating study end points.
   Methods/design A stepped-wedge randomized controlled trial was designed, guided by the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) planning and evaluation framework using an effectiveness-implementation hybrid type II design. Six electrophysiology programs from across the United States will participate. The primary effectiveness outcome is decision quality (defined by knowledge and values-treatment concordance). Patients with heart failure who are clinically eligible for an ICD are eligible for the study. Target enrollment is 900 participants.
   Discussion Study findings will provide a foundation for implementing decision support interventions, including PtDAs, with patients who have chronic progressive illness and are facing decisions involving invasive, preference-sensitive therapy options.

AB The vast majority of theories rooted in management build upon some aspect of human interactions-from two individuals interacting with one another to the aggregation of individual interactions at an organizational or societal level. In this Guidepost, we highlight the current trade-off researchers face between examining rich interactions versus being able to collect diverse and large quantities of interactions. We then introduce a novel open-source tool (www.SurvConf.com) that we developed to help alleviate this trade-off, which enables participants to engage in real-time interactions in groups of two to eight via video, audio, or text chat directly within traditional survey platforms (e.g., Qualtrics). This tool offers researchers the ability to record hundreds of synchronous dyadic or team interactions-at a distance-in a matter of days, which is nearly as simple as uploading a survey import file and launching the survey.

   The consortium for research in electroconvulsive therapy trial
SO JOURNAL OF ECT

DT Article
DE electroconvulsive therapy; major depression; clinical trial
ID MAJOR DEPRESSION; REMISSION; ECT; PHARMACOTHERAPY
AB Background: The use of double-blind designs, normally the criterion standard of clinical trials, is impossible when comparing medication therapy to procedural therapies for depression. In the Consortium for Research in Electroconvulsive Therapy (CORE) trial, depressed patients recently remitted with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) were randomly assigned to receive continuation therapy with either ECT or medications. The purpose of this article is to describe the design characteristics and challenges of the trial and of our method of dealing with the lack of double-blind outcome assessment.
   Methods: The primary outcome measure was time to relapse of depression in the continuation phase. We developed a method to achieve partial blinding of depressive severity assessment. This consisted of videotaping the structured interviews, having the videotapes co-rated by personnel not involved in the patient's care, and a videotape-tracking maneuver so that the assessor of the videotapes could be blinded to phase and type of treatment.
   Results: We enrolled 624 patients into the initial treatment phase of the trial. Of these, 201 met criteria for randomization into the second, continuation phase. Our videotape-tracking maneuver to reduce bias in outcome assessment worked well during the trial.
   Conclusions: The CORE study is the first multicenter, randomized controlled trial of continuation ECT in the relapse prevention of major depressive episodes. We successfully recruited a large number of severely depressed patients into a 6 month trial and used a method of reducing bias that might result from lack of blinding.

AB Purpose The linkage between patient-reported data and medico-administrative claims is of great interest for epidemiologic research. The goal of this study was to assess the willingness of people living with chronic pain to share personal identifiers on the web for the linkage of medico-administrative and patient-reported data.
   Methods This methodological investigation was achieved in the context of the implementation of the chronic pain treatment (COPE) cohort. A web-based recruitment initiative targeting adults living with chronic pain was conducted in the province of Quebec (Canada).
   Results A total of 1935 participants completed the questionnaire (mean age: 49.86 +/- 13.27; females: 83.69%), 921 (47.60%) of which agreed to data linkage and shared their personal identifiers (name, date of birth, health insurance number online). The most common reasons for refusal were: (1) concerns regarding data security/privacy (25.71%) and (2) the belief that the requested data were too personal/intrusive (13.52%). Some participants did not understand the relevance of data linkage (11.81%). Participants from the COPE cohort and those from the subsample who agreed to data linkage were comparable to other random samples of chronic pain individuals in terms of age and pain characteristics.
   Conclusions Although approximately half of the participants refused data linkage, our approach allowed for the implementation of a data platform that contains a diverse and substantial sample. This investigation has also led to the formulation of recommendations for web-based data linkage, including placing items designed to assess willingness to share personal identifiers at the end of the questionnaire, adding explanatory videos, and using a mixed-mode questionnaire.

AB Background: Shared decision making is important to ensure that patients receive therapies aligned with their goals and values. Based upon a detailed needs assessment with diverse stakeholders, pamphlet and video decision aids for destination therapy left ventricular assist devices (DT LVAD) were developed to help patients and their caregivers think through, forecast, and deliberate their options. These decision aids are the foundation of the Multicenter Trial of a Shared Decision Support Intervention for Patients and their Caregivers Offered Destination Therapy for End-Stage Heart Failure (DECIDE-LVAD) study, a multicenter, randomized trial aimed at understanding the effectiveness and implementation of a shared decision support intervention for patients considering DT LVAD.
   Methods/Design: A stepped-wedge randomized controlled trial was designed, guided by the RE-AIM framework and modeled after an effectiveness-implementation hybrid type II design. Six DT LVAD programs from across the United States will participate. Primary outcomes include knowledge and values-treatment concordance. Patients with advanced heart failure who are being considered for DT LVAD and their caregivers are eligible with a target enrollment of 168 dyads. From August 2014 to January 2015, an acceptability and feasibility pilot study was performed, which clarified opportunities and challenges around decision support for DT LVAD and resulted in significant modifications to the DECIDE-LVAD study.
   Discussion: Study findings will provide a foundation for implementing decision support interventions, including decision aids, with patients who have chronic progressive illness facing end-of-life decisions involving invasive, preference-sensitive therapy options.

AB Air pollution of particulate matter (PM) from traffic emissions has a significant impact on human health. Risk assessments for different traffic participants are often performed on the basis of data from local air quality monitoring stations. Numerous studies demonstrated the limitation of this approach. To assess the risk of PM exposure to a car driver more realistically, we measure the exposure to PM in a car cabin with a mobile aerosol spectrometer in Frankfurt am Main under different settings (local variations, opened versus a closed window) and compare it with data from stationary measurement. A video camera monitored the surroundings for potential PM source detection. In-cabin concentrations peaked at 508 mu g m(-3) for PM10, 133.9 mu g m(-3) for PM2.5, and 401.3 mu g m(-3) for coarse particles, and strongly depended on PM size and PM concentration in ambient air. The concentration of smaller particles showed low fluctuations, but the concentration of coarse particles showed high fluctuations with maximum values on busy roads. Several of these concentration peaks were assigned to the corresponding sources with characteristic particle size distribution profiles. The closure of the car window reduced the exposure to PM, and in particular to coarse particles. The mobile measured PM values differed significantly from stationary PM measures, although good correlations were computed for finer particles. Mobile rather than stationary measurements are essential to assess the risk of PM exposure for car passengers.

AB Participants in educational technology research regularly share personal data which carries with it risks. Informing participants of these data sharing risks is often only done so through text contained within a consent form. However, conceptualizations of data sharing risks and knowledge of responsible data management practices among teachers and learners may be impoverishedlimiting the effectiveness of a consent form in communicating such risks in a manner that adequately supports participants in making informed decisions about sharing their data. At two high schools participating in an educational research project involving the use of technology in the classroom, we investigate teacher and student conceptions of data sharing risks and knowledge of responsible data management practices; and introduce a communication approach that attempts to better inform educational technology research participants of such risks. Results of this study suggest that most teachers have not received formal training related to responsibly managing data; and both teachers and students see the need for such training as they come to realize that their understanding of responsible data management is underdeveloped. Thus, efforts beyond solely explaining data sharing risks in an informed consent form may be needed in educational technology research to facilitate ethical self-determination.

AB Models addressing urgent clinical needs for older adults with multiple advanced chronic conditions are lacking. This observational study describes a Community Paramedicine (CP) model for treatment of acute medical conditions within an Advanced Illness Management (AIM) program, and compares its effect on emergency department (ED) use and subsequent hospitalization with that of traditional emergency medical services (EMS). Community paramedics were trained to evaluate and, with telemedicine- enhanced physician guidance, treat acute illnesses in individuals' homes. They were also able to transport to the ED if needed. The CP model was implemented between January 1, 2014, and April 30, 2015 in a suburban-urban AIM program. Participants included 1,602 individuals enrolled in the AIM program with high rates of dementia, decubitus ulcers, diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Participants had a median age of 83 and an average of five activity of daily living dependencies (range 0-6). During the study period, there were 664 CP responses and 1,091 traditional EMS transports to the ED among 773 individuals. Only 22% of CP responses required transport; 78% were evaluated and treated in the home. Individuals that community paramedics transported to the ED had higher rates of hospitalization (82.2%) than those using traditional EMS (68.9%) (P <.001). Post-CP surveys showed that all respondents felt the program was of high quality. Results support the potential benefits of CP and invite further evaluation of this innovative care model.

AB This paper investigates research using VGI and geo-social media in the disaster management context Relying on the method of systematic mapping, it develops a classification schema that captures three levels of main category, focus, and intended use, and analyzes the relationships with the employed data sources and analysis methods. It focuses the scope to the pioneering field of disaster management but the described approach and the developed classification schema are easily adaptable to different application domains or future developments. The results show that a hypothesized consolidation of research, characterized through the building of canonical bodies of knowledge and advanced application cases with refined methodology, has not yet happened. The majority of the studies investigate the challenges and potential solutions of data handling, with fewer studies focusing on socio-technological issues or advanced applications. This trend is currently showing no sign of change, highlighting that VGI research is still very much technology-driven as opposed to theory- or application-driven. From the results of the systematic mapping study, the authors formulate and discuss several research objectives for future work, which could lead to a stronger, more theory-driven treatment of the topic VGI in GIScience.
