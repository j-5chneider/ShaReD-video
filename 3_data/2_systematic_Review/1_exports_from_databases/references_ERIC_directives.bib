We encourage and give guidelines to reviewers to champion open science practices by warmly influencing authors to consider applying open science practices to quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-methods research and providing ample support to produce higher-quality publications. Instead of imposing open science practices on authors, we advocate reviewers suggest small, non-threatening, specific steps to support authors without making them feel overwhelmed, judged, or punished. We believe that these small steps taken by reviewers will make a difference to create a more supportive environment for researchers to adopt more open science practices.},

This paper discusses open science in relation to educational practices and resources and reports on a study to investigate current educational practices from the perspective of open science. We argue that offering students opportunities via open educational practices raises their awareness of future open science goals and teaches them the skills needed to reach those goals. We present online survey results from 210 participants with teaching responsibility at higher education institutions in Germany. While some of them try to establish more open learning and teaching settings, most respondents apply rather traditional ways of learning and teaching. 60\% do not use open educational resources -- many have not even heard of them -- nor do they make their courses open for an online audience. Participants' priority lies in resource accuracy and quality and we still see a gap between the benefit of open practices and their practicability and applicability. The paper contributes to the general discussion of open practices in higher education by looking at open science practices and their adaptation to the learning and teaching environment.

Yet "the context and purpose" component of the data may remain elusive if just a generic database is made available. We describe the use of open data in introductory courses. Countries and cities continue to share data through open data portals. Hence, educators can find regional data that engage their students more effectively. We present excerpts from case studies that show the application of statistical methods to data on: crime, housing, rainfall, tourist travel, and others. Data wrangling and discussion of results are recognized as important case study components. Thus, the open data based case studies attend most GAISE College Report recommendations.

However, evidence from meta-research and large-scale replication projects suggests that the published research base likely reflects bias, which threatens the validity and credibility of research-based recommendations.

In this chapter, we propose that open-science reforms, which aim to make the research process as open and transparent as possible, can be applied to help address these issues.

	abstract = {Cybersecurity is no longer an issue discussed only between the professionals or technologists, but it is also closely related to ordinary people whose daily life is exposed to kinds of cyberattacks. And Womabat Security Technologies conducted a survey revealed that ransomware is an unknown concept to nearly two-thirds of employees. In practical, almost 95\% of cybersecurity attacks are due to human error. At fact, expensive and sophisticated systems cannot work effectively without considering the human factor, while human factor is the major vulnerability in cybersecurity. Thus, it has great significance to give people cybersecurity awareness training. In this paper, we present a system, named ASURA, providing adaptive training aimed at improving cybersecurity awareness of people. Three issues can't be neglected in adaptive cybersecurity awareness training, as follows. Firstly, we need to decide the proper training contents from the huge training materials. Secondly, the training contents should be timely updated, as cyber attacks constantly changing. At last, we should conduct training through effective and acceptable approach. We solved above three issues in this paper, and the innovative idea of this paper is constructing hierarchical concept map from the LOD database DBpedia. Then, we employ a series of processing on hierarchical concept map, including PageRank algorithm used to calculate the importance of each concept node, and filtering used to filtered out undefined and unrelated concepts. In particular, we get training contents from DBpedia dynamically and timely updated, so that training contents is keeping up to date. ASURA delivered training contents completely online, thus significant trimmed budget and allowed learners accessing training outside of a traditional classroom. Moreover, ASURA provide adaptive training targeted to individual learner, as it generate training contents based on the keyword from the learner.},

Through qualitative data analysis, we examine students' apprehensions and motivations to publish their artifacts. We find that key motivators are a sense of belonging, personal reward, and an active contribution to a culture of collaboration, whereas apprehensions are grounded in concerns about the quality of their work, uncertainties about licensing, and fear of vulnerability through visibility. We show that open science practices and OEP can be combined synergistically in process-oriented, research-based, and collaborative seminar concepts, and we formulate recommendations for lecturers on how to successfully address OEP in the classroom.},

A key question arising from these expectations is how to equip the workforce and students with OD skills. Based on literature from education design and design fields and an empirical analysis of different OD training activities in five European countries, we identified a need to support OD teachers by developing a visual, structured and simple model to guide them through the adaption and implementation of PBL and foster their competences as learning designers, thus the paper proposes an OD--Problem-Based Learning (PBL) pathway model. The pathway model aims to guide educators by structuring the design process of OD training activities and promotes design skills among teachers. The pathway model comprises five main steps: understand, review, design, teach and reflect. Each step provides guidelines on how to plan an OD course.},

	abstract = {Over the past decade, machine learning has become an integral part of educational technologies. With more and more applications such as students' performance prediction, course recommendation, dropout prediction and knowledge tracing relying upon machine learning models, there is increasing evidence and concerns about bias and unfairness of these models. Unfair models can lead to inequitable outcomes for some groups of students and negatively impact their learning. We show by real-world examples that educational data has embedded bias that leads to biased student modeling, which urges the development of fairness formalizations and fair algorithms for educational applications. Several formalizations of fairness have been proposed that can be classified into two types: (i) group fairness and (ii) individual fairness. Group fairness guarantees that groups are treated fairly as a whole, which might not be fair to some individuals. Thus individual fairness has been proposed to make sure fairness is achieved on individual level. In this work, we focus on developing an individually fair model for identifying students at-risk of underperforming. We propose a model which is based on the idea that the prediction for a student (identifying at-risk students) should not be influenced by his/her sensitive attributes. The proposed model is shown to effectively remove bias from these predictions and hence, making them useful in aiding all students. [For the full proceedings, see ED607784.]},

A three-phase project design included gathering and analyzing case studies of OEPs globally, and, in particular, in the South Mediterranean; the organization of regional forums to encourage priorities for change; and the multi-national design and pilot implementation of a 'training of trainers' course for academic capacity building in OEPs as part of curricula reform. We will discuss how the cultural approaches used among experts and project partners with different national, linguistic, and educational backgrounds have instigated change in policy and practice at a personal, institutional, and national level.},

Through this study, the authors examined the lack of open pedagogy usage in schools and potential barriers through the lens of teacher candidates' (n = 29) experiences with open pedagogy assignments. Within this qualitative study, the authors defined open pedagogy and utilized identity building and significance building tools to examine teacher candidates' perceptions of two different open pedagogy assignments. Candidates in one section worked on these assignments in a small group, while candidates in another section worked individually. Notable differences were observed among the candidates' responses that highlight the importance of opportunities for collaborative open pedagogy practices within teacher education programs. This analysis supports the field's understanding of ways teacher candidates' experiences might impact their use of open pedagogy assignments in the future, and, therefore, the advancement of open practices in schools. Implications highlight how open pedagogy in teacher preparation programs have the potential to increase equity-oriented practices in K-12 schools. From this analysis, recommendations are drawn for those who strive to increase equitable learning environments through open practices.},

Against the background of emerging open educational practices, a survey and interviews were conducted with instructional design professionals to establish, from their experience and practice, their roles and potential for advocacy of open educational practices (OEP) including open educational resources (OER). Among the results of the analysis, it was found that while instructional designers have a strong awareness of, and desire to advocate for, OEP in their institutions, their ability to move forward was limited by perceived barriers such as lack of relevant mandates and professional workload recognition, policy development and funding, awareness, and leadership support. In addition, there were gaps identified between what they most valued about OEP, such as implementing innovative pedagogies, and what they could actually initiate and advocate for in practice (i.e., adopt and support OER). They pointed to a lack of formal learning opportunities around OEP and expressed that their main sources of learning and support were of an informal nature, acquired through their networks and collaborations with peers.},

	abstract = {Data are a valuable national resource for a variety of stakeholders across all sectors of society. Dramatic advances in information and communication technology have opened up unprecedented opportunities for broad public access, innovative research, and citizen engagement, but this potential can be realized only if data are properly managed and exposed over time. New U.S. government requirements for exposing and managing federally funded research data add urgency to the call for curating data so that they can be used, re-used, and exploited by future generations. These new requirements have significant implications for cultural heritage institutions in addressing the current deficit in the capacity to support the re-use of data over time and across generations of technology (digital curation) and in enabling collaboration based on shared infrastructure. Cultural heritage encompasses various types of artifacts (analog or digital), as well as attributes and behaviors that groups or societies maintain over time to preserve connections to the past, present, and future. Cultural heritage institutions have a mission to support, perpetuate, and provide access to essential elements of culture as a whole. There are many different types of cultural heritage institutions, but three of the most commonly recognized are libraries, archives, and museums. Materials in their care are vital to the ongoing advancement and perpetuation of the sciences, social sciences, arts, and humanities. This report presents the implications for the cultural heritage community of the recent focus on creating public access to data and publications resulting from federal funding, and our recommendations for relevant stakeholders. The recommendations are based on a review of federal agencies' responses to new government requirements, case studies of seven digital curation projects, and an investigation of the current professional capacity for the long-term management of cultural heritage digital content, including data.

In this way, educators can facilitate students to understand how information is generated, processed, analysed and interpreted. This paper offers an initial exploration of ways in which the use of Open Data can be key in the development of transversal skills (including digital and data literacies, alongside skills for critical thinking, research, teamwork, and global citizenship), enhancing students' abilities to understand and select information sources, to work with, curate, analyse and interpret data, and to conduct and evaluate research. This paper also presents results of an exploratory survey that can guide further research into Open Data-led learning activities.

By analyzing relationships between these works, this paper lays out design principles that can empower educators seeking to create equitable open learning experiences. Findings: This paper finds several generative intersections between the social justice centered epistemology presented by Medina, empirical learning design studies and OEP. This study finds that structured learning designs which integrate well-researched principles may provide guidance for further practice and research in ways not generally discussed in open education literature. This paper builds on these findings by describing practical ways these intersections can be implemented in OEP.

	volume = {47},
	issn = {0033-0337},
	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide a literature review of the principal formats and frameworks that have been used in the last 20 years to exchange linguistic resources. It aims to give special attention to the most recent approaches to publishing linguistic linked open data on the Web. Design/methodology/approach: Research papers published since 1990 on the use of various formats, standards, frameworks and methods to exchange linguistic information were divided into two main categories: those proposing specific schemas and syntaxes to suit the requirements of a given type of linguistic data (these are referred to as offline approaches), and those adopting the linked data (LD) initiative and the semantic web technologies to support the interoperability of heterogeneous linguistic resources. For each paper, the type of linguistic resource exchanged, the framework/format used, the interoperability approach taken and the related projects were identified. Findings: The information gathered in the survey reflects an increase in recent years in approaches adopting the LD initiative. This is due to the fact that the structural and syntactic issues which arise when addressing the interoperability of linguistic resources can be solved by applying semantic web technologies. What remains an open issue in the field of computational linguistics is the development of knowledge artefacts and mechanisms to support the alignment of the different aspects of linguistic resources in order to guarantee semantic and conceptual interoperability in the linked open data (LOD) cloud. Ontologies have proved to be of great use in achieving this goal. Research limitations/implications: The research presented here is by no means a comprehensive or all-inclusive survey of all existing approaches to the exchange of linguistic resources. Rather, the aim was to highlight, analyze and categorize the most significant advances in the field. Practical implications: This survey has practical implications for computational linguists and for every application requiring new developments in natural language processing. In addition, multilingual issues can be better addressed when semantic interoperability of heterogeneous linguistic resources is achieved. Originality/value: The paper provides a survey of past and present research and developments addressing the interoperability of linguistic resources, including those where the linked data initiative has been adopted.

The results are based on data collected through an online survey among 724 university educators. Depending on the actual use of OER and open teaching practices by the survey respondents, we have categorized them along a scale that goes from "novice" to "expert", and we analyzed the data to evaluate their use of OER and their adoption of open teaching practices, looking for relationships between the two phenomena. The main finding of this paper, which confirms the latest research findings from the open education community, is that a strong relationship exists between the two dimensions: The more an educator uses OER, the more he will probably adopt open teaching practices, and vice versa. These results are discussed with a view to use this virtuous circle between the use of open content and adoption of open teaching as a way to build generalized open education capacity among universities' teaching staff.},

The framework was developed from the in-depth analysis of 20 cases of higher education practitioners, which revealed patterns of OER reuse across disciplines, institutions and needs.

	abstract = {Open education, including the use of open educational resources (OER) and the adoption of open education practice, has the potential to challenge educators to change their practice in fundamental ways. This paper forms part of a larger study focusing on higher education educators' learning from and through their engagement with OER. The first part of the study was a quantitative survey investigating educators' learning behaviour when they learned to use OER in their practice. The second part of the study explored qualitatively how educators engaged with OER and how they conceptualised their learning. Data were gathered through interviews with 30 higher education educators. This paper reports the analysis of these interviews. The analysis draws on the theory of self-regulated learning and cultural-historical activity theory to explore the challenges adult education practitioners encounter when changing their practice. The study tests the application of a framework that traces the discursive manifestations of contradictions, exploring how this framework can be used to examine different aspects of self-regulated learning as educators learn how to use OER. We have identified three distinct tensions in higher education educators' practice: tensions between the emerging needs of the individual (as he or she adopts new forms of practice) and organisational policies; between the transfer of responsibilities from educators to students as new practice is embedded and institutional accountability; and between cost efficiency and learning objectives. The framework for the discursive manifestations of contradictions was a useful tool used to surface these apparent tensions.},

	abstract = {In recent years India has shown a growing appetite for open educational resources (OER) and open educational practices (OEP). Despite this, there is a paucity of research on OER use and impact, the extensiveness of OEP, and attitudes towards openness in India. This paper reports on research intended to help fill that knowledge gap by conducting a pan-India survey using many of the questions developed by the UK Open University's Open Education Research Hub (OERH) for use in its OER impact research around the world (http://oerresearchhub.org/collaborative-research/instruments/). Delivered online, in English and Hindi, the pan-India survey is the biggest of its kind to have been conducted in India. Analysis of the collected data reveals extensive evidence of educators using OER to improve their teaching, and survey respondents' common belief in the educational benefits of OER. In addition, despite encountering greater technical and structural barriers to OER use than those typically experienced by OERH survey respondents from the Global North, the pan-Indian survey respondents tend to show more engagement with OEP than their developed country peers, notably in terms of creating resources and publishing them on a Creative Commons (CC) license, and in adding comments to OER repositories. Accordingly, this paper presents an emergent model intended to better capture the rich contextual factors inhibiting and enabling OER use and OEP in the Global South. It must be acknowledged, however, that our findings relate to a fairly highly educated selection of educators, teacher-educators, students, education managers, academics, activists and policymakers. We therefore plan to expand on our model by conducting further research with a more diverse group of respondents, to include people facing technological, economic and societal barriers to using OER.},

	abstract = {This article describes a small-scale study that explored the relationship between the pedagogical practices characterised as "open" and the existing model of undergraduate teaching and learning at a large research-intensive university (RIU). The aim was to determine the factors that might enable (conversely impede) the greater uptake of open educational resources (OER) in universities of this type. The research was informed by two theoretical frameworks. The first was derived from the literature on open educational practice and served as the basis for an interview schedule. The second was derived from the literature on RIUs and provided a structure for reflecting on the data in three areas of activity: pedagogy, outreach and governance. The researchers conducted semi-structured interviews with 14 academics, selected either for their involvement in open practices or for the recognition they had received for excellence in their teaching. The interview schedule was derived from a literature survey focusing on open pedagogic models. Topics discussed with interviewees included the "flattening" of the teacher-student relationship, students' assumption of responsibility for their own learning, learning as (or in) a community and the possible influence of open practices in research on teaching. Findings suggest that open educational approaches can be accommodated in a university's prevailing pedagogic model without compromising its integrity. However, openness can enhance the specifics of that pedagogy; for example, through aligning research-informed teaching with emergent open practices in research and equipping students with the skills necessary for living and working in an open world. There is a closer alignment between releasing OER and an RIU's strategic mission for outreach. Nevertheless, the spread of open practices in both pedagogy and outreach hinges on issues of governance, which in RIUs is characterised by considerable emphasis on the autonomy of individual academics.},

It is in this perspective that the willingness to engage in such practices among academics in Rwandan public higher education was investigated with an agenda to trigger responsive actions. Via convenience/availability and volunteer sampling, 170 academics were invited to participate in the study and 85 of them completed and returned an email self-completion questionnaire. The results revealed that the majority of participants were willing to contribute to Open Educational Resources (OER) by publishing their work under an open licence. Participants were also willing to engage in diverse OEPs including 1) finding OER and evaluating their quality, 2) participating in and evaluating open courses, 3) aggregating OER, 4) adapting OER and open courses, and 5) assessing accomplishment from open learning based on OER and open courses for credit. National and institutional policies were found to be the potentially most important enablers of academics' engagement in those practices. In the light of the findings, the researcher argues that the inclusion of more learners in the higher education system would make academics more impactful than simply the citation of their work, a stance that was reflected in subsequent responsive actions. This study may benefit institutions and policy makers who are interested in opening up higher education, especially the University of Rwanda that is expected to contribute significantly to the transformation of the country into a middle-income, knowledge-based society.},

	abstract = {This paper reports on a study of the implementation of science teacher education through virtual and open distance learning in the Mashonaland Central Province, Zimbabwe. The study provides insight into challenges faced by students and lecturers on inception of the program at four centres. Data was collected from completed evaluation survey forms of forty-two lecturers who were directly involved at the launch of the program and in-depth interviews. Qualitative data analysis revealed that the programme faces potential threat from centre-, institution-, lecturer-, and student-related factors. These include limited resources, large classes, inadequate expertise in open and distance education, inappropriate science teacher education qualifications, implementer conflict of interest in program participation, students' low self-esteem, lack of awareness of quality parameters of delivery systems among staff, and lack of standard criteria to measure the quality of services. The paper recommends that issues raised be addressed in order to produce quality teachers. (Contains 4 figures.)},

	abstract = {As a Transversal Action under the European eLearning Programme, the Open e-Learning Content Observatory Services (OLCOS) project carries out a set of activities that aim at fostering the creation, sharing and re-use of Open Educational Resources (OER) in Europe and beyond. OER are understood to comprise content for teaching and learning, software-based tools and services, and licenses that allow for open development and re-use of content, tools and services. The OLCOS road mapping work was conducted to provide decision makers with an overview of current and likely future developments in OER and recommendations on how various challenges in OER could be addressed. While the results of the road mapping will provide some basis for policy and institutional planning, strategic leadership and decision making is needed for implementing measures that are likely to promote a further uptake of open educational practices and resources. OER are understood to be an important element of policies that want to leverage education and lifelong learning for the knowledge economy and society. However, OLCOS emphasises that it is crucial to also promote innovation and change in educational practices. In particular, OLCOS warns that delivering OER to the still dominant model of teacher-centred knowledge transfer will have little effect on equipping teachers, students and workers with the competences, knowledge and skills to participate successfully in the knowledge economy and society. This report emphasises the need to foster open practices of teaching and learning that are informed by a competency-based educational framework. However, it is understood that a shift towards such practices will only happen in the longer term in a step-by-step process. Bringing about this shift will require targeted and sustained efforts by educational leaders at all levels. The OLCOS Project Consortium invites decision makers and stakeholders in OER to consult the project website, www.olcos.org, for further information on ongoing activities and other products. A list of selected projects and resources is also included. [This report was produced by the Open e-Learning Content Observatory Services (OLCOS) project.]},

	title = {Impact of {Problem} {Finding} on the {Quality} of {Authentic} {Open} {Inquiry} {Science} {Research} {Projects}},
	abstract = {Problem finding is a creative process whereby individuals develop original ideas for study. Secondary science students who successfully participate in authentic, novel, open inquiry studies must engage in problem finding to determine viable and suitable topics. This study examined problem finding strategies employed by students who successfully completed and presented the results of their open inquiry research at the 2007 Connecticut Science Fair and the 2007 International Science and Engineering Fair. A multicase qualitative study was framed through the lenses of creativity, inquiry strategies, and situated cognition learning theory. Data were triangulated by methods (interviews, document analysis, surveys) and sources (students, teachers, mentors, fair directors, documents). The data demonstrated that the quality of student projects was directly impacted by the quality of their problem finding. Effective problem finding was a result of students using resources from previous, specialized experiences. They had a positive self-concept and a temperament for both the creative and logical perspectives of science research. Successful problem finding was derived from an idiosyncratic, nonlinear, and flexible use and understanding of inquiry. Finally, problem finding was influenced and assisted by the community of practicing scientists, with whom the students had an exceptional ability to communicate effectively. As a result, there appears to be a juxtaposition of creative and logical/analytical thought for open inquiry that may not be present in other forms of inquiry. Instructional strategies are suggested for teachers of science research students to improve the quality of problem finding for their students and their subsequent research projects.

The study was conducted in a class of 39 primary 6 pupils of mixed ability who carried out four investigations. Data were based on pupils' responses on an attitude survey questionnaire, interviews, video tapes of pupils performing the investigations and field notes. The majority of the pupils liked conducting such investigations. Reasons for positive responses were that the pupils had the freedom to explore and devise their own procedures to find out things that they wanted to know about, they could work together and discuss with friends, the investigations were interesting and it was a valuable learning experience. Reasons for negative responses included the difficulty of coming up with good ideas to design the investigations, and group conflicts. The findings also indicate that group dynamics played an important role in influencing pupils' attitudes towards the investigations.},

	title = {Linking {Instruction} and {Assessment} in {Science}: {Science} {Learning} {Opportunities} and {Student} {Performance} on a {Set} of {Open}-{Ended} {Science} {Questions}.},
	abstract = {The link between instruction in middle school science and assessment in ninth grade science in a small rural midwestern school district was investigated. Science students, in middle school grades 6-8 (917) and their 13 science teachers responded to surveys used to characterize science learning opportunities in the middle school classes. Ninth grade students (309) responded to a set of open-ended science questions that were developed from a standardized science test. The survey data provided a contextual framework for interpretation of ninth grade student performance on the open-ended science questions. The open-ended questions included questions for which students were required to graph and interpret data, write conclusions, identify control variables, and judge the validity of  information. These open-ended questions were scored by three raters according to a scoring rubric. Middle school students did report having science learning opportunities to practice science as inquiry, and their teachers reported that much of the science inquiry practice was contextual. At least 90\% of the ninth graders were from the same school district, but when practice in controlling data and making predictions was reported, student data from the open-ended questions suggested minimal transfer of these skills. The interpretation and use of graphic information and the actual graphing of data were areas that were problematic for ninth graders, as was the ability to provide reasons in support of answers. Recommendations based on this study include using a variety of contextual settings  for framing science inquiry practice and more attention on discussing, reading, and writing in the content area.

The contributed chapters in this book are organizes around these core processes of learning and teaching: subject matter representation; activation of learning and engagement of students with that subject matter content; encouragement of socialization and interaction between and among students; assessment of learning outcomes; and provision of feedback to students. The book consists of five parts. The four chapters in Part I articulate the key principles in the representation of subject matter content with the help of notable experiences with ICT. The four chapters  in Part II focus on creative uses of ICT in influencing learning by engaging students with the subject matter. In Part III, the four chapters focus on how ICT is used to integrate such processes as cooperative learning into educational practice and how these practices are influencing teachers' approaches to teaching and students' approaches to learning. The four chapters in Part IV examine how ICT affordances can be used to leverage approaches to the assessment of learning outcomes. In Part V, the three chapters focus on how certain fundamental principles of feedback can be leveraged with clever use of ICT. Includes an index. (AEF)},

A key feature of the followup study planning sessions was discussion about collecting useful information beyond the minimum required for the VEDS report. An open-book database approach was adopted instead of minimal compliance with federal regulations. An operational analysis of the outcomes from the process included the organizational planning and structure that evolved from the groundwork for this project, the project  products such as applications software, and operational difficulties encountered in implementing the project (content validity, confidentiality, and access).
