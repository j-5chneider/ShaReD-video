TI <i>cchsflow</i>: an open science approach to transform and combine
   population health surveys

AB Setting The Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) is one of the world's largest ongoing cross-sectional population health surveys, with over 130,000 respondents every two years or over 1.1 million respondents since its inception in 2001. While the survey remains relatively consistent over the years, there are differences between cycles that pose a challenge to analyze the survey over time. Intervention A program package called cchsflow was developed to transform and harmonize CCHS variables to consistent formats across multiple survey cycles. An open science approach was used to maintain transparency, reproducibility and collaboration. Outcomes The cchsflow R package uses CCHS survey data between 2001 and 2014. Worksheets were created that identify variables, their names in previous cycles, their category structure, and their final variable names. These worksheets were then used to recode variables in each CCHS cycle into consistently named and labelled variables. Following, survey cycles can be combined. The package was then added as a GitHub repository to encourage collaboration with other researchers. Implication The cchsflow package has been added to the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) and contains support for over 160 CCHS variables, generating a combined data set of over 1 million respondents. By implementing open science practices, cchsflow aims to minimize the amount of time needed to clean and prepare data for the many CCHS users across Canada.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide a literature review of the principal formats and frameworks that have been used in the last 20 years to exchange linguistic resources It aims to give special attention to the most recent approaches to publishing linguistic linked open data on the Web.
   Design/methodology/approach - Research papers published since 1990 on the use of various formats, standards, frameworks and methods to exchange linguistic information were divided into two main categories: those proposing specific schemas and syntaxes to suit the requirements of a given type of linguistic data (these are referred to as offline approaches), and those adopting the linked data (LD) initiative and the semantic web technologies to support the interoperability of heterogeneous linguistic resources. For each paper, the type of linguistic resource exchanged, the framework/format used, the interoperability approach taken and the related projects were identified.
   Findings - The information gathered in the survey reflects an increase in recent years in approaches adopting the LD initiative. This is due to the fact that the structural and syntactic issues which arise when addressing the interoperability of linguistic resources can be solved by applying semantic web technologies. What remains an open issue in the field of computational linguistics is the development of knowledge artefacts and mechanisms to support the alignment of the different aspects of linguistic resources in order to guarantee semantic and conceptual interoperability in the linked open data (LOD) cloud. Ontologies have proved to be of great use in achieving this goal.
   Research limitations/implications - The research presented here is by no means a comprehensive or all-inclusive survey of all existing approaches to the exchange of linguistic resources. Rather, the aim was to highlight, analyze and categorize the most significant advances in the field.
   Practical implications - This survey has practical implications for computational linguists and for every application requiring new developments in natural language processing. In addition, multilingual issues can be better addressed when semantic interoperability of heterogeneous linguistic resources is achieved.
   Originality/value - The paper provides a survey of past and present research and developments addressing the interoperability of linguistic resources, including those where the linked data initiative has been adopted.

ID PREREGISTRATION; REPLICATION; PSYCHOLOGY; PREVALENCE
AB Purpose: Open science is a collection of practices that seek to improve the accessibility, transparency, and replicability of science. Although these practices have garnered interest in related fields, it remains unclear whether open science practices have been adopted in the field of communication sciences and disor-ders (CSD). This study aimed to survey the knowledge, implementation, and perceived benefits and barriers of open science practices in CSD. Method: An online survey was disseminated to researchers in the United States actively engaged in CSD research. Four-core open science practices were examined: preregistration, self-archiving, gold open access, and open data. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and regression models. Results: Two hundred twenty-two participants met the inclusion criteria. Most participants were doctoral students (38%) or assistant professors (24%) at R1 institutions (58%). Participants reported low knowledge of preregistration and gold open access. There was, however, a high level of desire to learn more for all practices. Implementation of open science practices was also low, most notably for preregistration, gold open access, and open data (< 25%). Predic-tors of knowledge and participation, as well as perceived barriers to implemen-tation, are discussed. Conclusion: Although participation in open science appears low in the field of CSD, participants expressed a strong desire to learn more in order to engage in these practices in the future.

It highlights users' perceptions of the term "open data", expectations of infrastructure functionalities, and barriers and enablers for the sharing of data. A wide range of good practice examples was pointed out by the respondents which demonstrates a substantial uptake of data sharing through e-infrastructures and a further need for enhancement and consolidation. Among all policy responses, funder policies seem to be the most important motivator. This supports the conclusion that stronger mandates will strengthen the case for data sharing.

AB Linked open data is a relatively new topic area with great potential in a wide range of fields. In the tourism domain, many studies are using linked open data to address the problem of location-based recommendation by integrating data with other linked open datasets to enrich data and tourism content for reacting to the needs of tourists. This work aims not only to present a systematic review and mapping of the linked open data in location-based recommendation system on tourism domain, but also to provide an overview of the current research status in the area. First, we classify journal papers in this area from 2001 to 2018 by the year of publication. Second, we analyze and categorize journal papers by the different recommendation applications including problem formulations, data collections, proposed algorithms/systems, and experimental results. Third, we group the linked open data sources used in location-based recommendation system on tourism. Next, we summarize the research achievements and present the distribution of the different categories of location-based recommendation applications via linked open data. Last, we also guide the possible future research direction for the linked open data in location-based recommendations on tourism.

AB The study investigates the awareness, practices and attitudes of researchers in regard to open data - i.e. the sharing and reuse of research data - which is part of a larger study that concentrated on the scholarly communication readiness of Malaysian researchers in Open Science. The data were gathered by means of a survey which obtained 135 responses from researchers based in five research universities in Malaysia. The main conclusions are: (a) the researchers are aware of open data, yet, they are not practising it as shown in the mean scores, as well as in their responses towards the statements asked; (b) unclear information on data privacy policy, misuse of data, and the fear of losing publication opportunity are part of disincentives for data sharing. The requisite for open data understanding, practices and attitudinal change is needed for these may impact research practices, government policies and scientific knowledge, leading to research transparency and accountability, social benefit and economic growth. This paper concludes with a discussion that policies incentivizing the sharing and reuse of open data, as well as tools and guidance to support data sharing, and a strong incentives and rewards to implement open data among researchers, should be encouraged. Future studies should look into the importance of rewards for data sharing among researchers' institutions. Studies bridging the gap between policy and practices of open data should be examined, if true openness in research is to be established in Malaysia.

LA English
DT Article
DE Heritage institutions; Open data; Open content; Crowdsourcing; Diffusion
   of innovations
AB In a pilot survey we examined the diffusion of open data and crowdsourcing practices among heritage institutions in Switzerland. The results suggest that so far, only very few institutions have adopted an open data / open content policy. There are however signs that many institutions may adopt this innovation in a near future: A majority of institutions considers open data as important and believes that the opportunities prevail over the risks. The main obstacles that need to be overcome are the institutions' reservations with regard to free licensing and their fear of losing control. With regard to crowdsourcing the data suggest that the diffusion process will be slower than for open data. Although approximately 10% of the responding institutions already seem to experiment with crowdsourcing, there is no general breakthrough in sight, as a majority of respondents remain skeptical with regard to the benefits. We argue that the observed difference in the dynamics of the diffusion of these innovations is primarily due to the fact that crowdsourcing is perceived by heritage institutions as more complex than open data, that it isn't readily expected to lead to any sizeable advantages, and that adopting crowdsourcing practices may require deeper cultural changes.

AB Central values of science are, among others, transparency, verifiability, replicability, and openness. The currently very prominent Open Science (OS) movement supports these values. Among its most important principles are open methodology (comprehensive and useful documentation of methods and materials used), open access to published research output, and open data (making collected data available for re-analyses). We here present a survey conducted among members of the German Psychological Society (N = 337), in which we applied a mixed-methods approach (quantitative and qualitative data) to assess attitudes toward OS in general and toward data sharing more specifically. Attitudes toward OS were distinguished into positive expectations ("hopes") and negative expectations ("fears"). These were uncorrelated. There were generally more hopes associated with OS and data sharing than fears. Both hopes and fears were highest among early career researchers and lowest among professors. The analysis of the open answers revealed that generally positive attitudes toward data sharing (especially sharing of data related to a published article) are somewhat diminished by cost/benefit considerations. The results are discussed with respect to individual researchers' behavior and with respect to structural changes in the research system.

AB In the years following the reproducibility crisis in behavioral sciences, increased attention of the scientific community has been dedicated to the correct application of statistical inference and promotion of open science practices. In the present survey, we contacted psychology researchers, lecturers, and doctoral students from all universities in Slovakia and the Slovak Academy of Sciences via email. Together we re-ceived answers from 65 participants. Questions in the survey covered the most common misconceptions about statistical hypothesis testing, as well as awareness, attitudes, and barriers related to the adherence to open science practices. We found a high prevalence of statistical misconceptions, namely related to the interpretation of p-values and interpretation of null results. At the same time, participants indicated mostly positive attitudes towards open science practices, such as data sharing and preregistration, and were highly interested in further training. These results provide an insight into the needs of the Slovak psychology research community. This is an important step in the further dissemination of open science practices and the prevention of common statistical and methodological errors.

AB Context
   Biobanks are important resources which enable large-scale genomic research with human samples and data, raising significant ethical concerns about how participants' information is managed and shared. Three previous studies of the Canadian public's opinion about these topics have been conducted. Building on those results, an online survey representing the first study of public perceptions about biobanking spanning all Canadian provinces was conducted. Specifically, this study examined qualitative views about biobank objectives, governance structure, control and ownership of samples and data, benefit sharing, consent practices and data sharing norms, as well as additional questions and ethical concerns expressed by the public.
   Results
   Over half the respondents preferred to give a one-time general consent for the future sharing of their samples among researchers. Most expressed willingness for their data to be shared with the international scientific community rather than used by one or more Canadian institutions. Whereas more respondents indicated a preference for one-time general consent than any other model of consent, they constituted less than half of the total responses, revealing a lack of consensus among survey respondents regarding this question. Respondents identified biobank objectives, governance structure and accountability as the most important information to provide participants. Respondents' concerns about biobanking generally centred around the control and ownership of biological samples and data, especially with respect to potential misuse by insurers, the government and other third parties. Although almost half the respondents suggested that these should be managed by the researchers' institutions, results indicate that the public is interested in being well-informed about these projects and suggest the importance of increased involvement from participants. In conclusion, the study discusses the viability of several proposed models for informed consent, including e-governance, independent trustees and the use of exclusion clauses, in the context of these new findings about the views of the Canadian public.

DE Gambling; research design; reliability; best practice; survey
AB Scientists across disciplines have begun to implement 'open science' principles and practices, which are designed to enhance the quality, transparency, and replicability of scientific research. Yet, studies examining the use of open science practices in social science fields such as psychology and economics show that awareness and use of such practices often is low. In gambling studies research, no studies to date have empirically investigated knowledge of and use of open science practices. In the present study, we collected survey data about awareness and use of open science practices from 86 gambling studies research stakeholders who had attended a major international gambling studies conference in May 2019. We found that - as hypothesized - a minority of gambling research stakeholders reported: 1) either some or extensive experience using open science research practices in general, and 2) either some or regular experience using specific open science practices, including study pre-registration, open materials/code, open data, and pre-print archiving. Most respondents indicated that replication was important for all studies in gambling research, and that genetic, neuroscience, and lab-based game characteristic studies were areas most in need of replication. Our results have important implications for open science education initiatives and for contemporary research methodology in gambling studies.

AB Interest in transparent and open science is increasing in special education, school psychology, and related disciplines. Proponents for open science reforms provide evidence that researchers in special education, and the broader social sciences, engage in practices that mitigates its credibility and reduces the validity of information disseminated to practitioners and policymakers. In light of these issues, this article reports on a survey of journal editors-in-chief and associate editors to gain insight into concerns regarding research reproducibility, and the familiarity and viability of open science for improving research credibility. Results indicate that respondents were concerned about research reproducibility, were moderately familiar with open science practices, and viewed many as effective for improving research credibility. Finally, respondents supported the use of journals to encourage open science practices though there was little support for requiring their use. Findings are discussed in relation to open science and implications for research and practice.

ID CREDIBILITY
AB In two studies, we examined whether open science practices, such as making materials, data, and code of a study openly accessible, positively affect public trust in science. Furthermore, we investigated whether the potential trust-damaging effects of research being funded privately (e.g. by a commercial enterprise) may be buffered by such practices. After preregistering six hypotheses, we conducted a survey study (Study 1; N = 504) and an experimental study (Study 2; N = 588) in two German general population samples. In both studies, we found evidence for the positive effects of open science practices on trust, though it should be noted that in Study 2, results were more inconsistent. We did not however find evidence for the aforementioned buffering effect. We conclude that while open science practices may contribute to increasing trust in science, the importance of making use of open science practices visible should not be underestimated.

AB The National Database of Health Insurance Claims and Specific Health Checkups of Japan (NDB) Open Data Japan is helpful for attaining simple and comprehensive understanding of medical care in Japan. Herein, we investigated the transition of anti-HIV-drug use in Japan over a 4-year period from fiscal year (FY) 2016 to FY 2019 using data on anti-HIV drugs that were extracted from the 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th NDB Open Data Japan. Then, the data were stratified by mechanism of action, single-tablet regimen (STR) or non-STR, age groups, and sex and analyzed. Throughout the study period, the prescription volume for tenofovir alafenamide fumarate as the backbone drug and integrase strand transfer inhibitors as the anchor drug increased. In FY 2019, STRs constituted approximately 44% of the total combination antiretroviral therapy regimens, 1.6 times higher than that in FY 2016 (27%). With the advent of newer drugs and regimens, the differences in anti-HIV drugs prescribed to patients of different ages and sex gradually diminished; however, differences were unremarkable in the first period, especially between sexes. The NDB Open Data Japan made it relatively easy to evaluate recent trends in anti-HIV prescription in Japan, indicating its usefulness for continuous surveys in this field.

AB The viability of modern open science norms and practices depends on public disclosure of new knowledge, methods, and materials. However, increasing industry funding of research can restrict the dissemination of results and materials. We show, through a survey sample of 837 German scientists in life sciences, natural sciences, engineering, and social sciences, that scientists who receive industry funding are twice as likely to deny requests for research inputs as those who do not. Receiving external funding in general does not affect denying others access. Scientists who receive external funding of any kind are, however, 50 % more likely to be denied access to research materials by others, but this is not affected by being funded specifically by industry.

AB Public Significance Statement Ethnic minority psychology research/cultural diversity science (EM/D) emphasizes empirical approaches that are responsive to the needs and experiences of people of color, whereas the current mainstream open science movement encourages open communications, democratic review process, and transparency of methods and data for critical scrutiny by other researchers. Findings from three studies showed that open science practices such as preregistrations, material and data sharing, and open-access publishing are not commonly adopted in EM/D, likely because of concerns about possible risks to ethnoracial minority scholars and study populations. We offer practical recommendations to bridge these gaps and suggest future directions to connect EM/D and mainstream open science movement to better understand the experiences of ethnoracial minority communities and benefit the lives of the diverse human population.
   Objectives: There are two potentially useful but nonintersecting efforts to help ensure that psychological science produces valid and credible information and contributes to the understanding of diverse human experiences. Whereas North American ethnic minority psychology research/cultural diversity science (EM/D) emphasizes cultural competency to yield contextualized psychological understanding of understudied and underserved minority populations, current open science (OS) approaches emphasize material and data sharing, and statistical proficiency to maximize the replicability of mainstream findings. To illuminate the extent of and explore reasons for this bifurcation, and OS's potential impact on EM/D, we conducted three studies. Method and Results: In Study 1, we reviewed editorial/publishing policies and empirical articles appearing in four major EM/D journals on the incentives for and use of OS. Journals varied in OS-related policies; 32 of 823 empirical articles incorporated any OS practices. Study 2 was a national mixed-methods survey of EM/D scholars' (N = 141) and journal editors' (N = 16) views about and experiences with OS practices. Emerged themes included beliefs about the impact of OS on scientific quality, possible professional disadvantages for EM/D scholars, and concerns about the welfare of and ethical risks posed for communities of color. In Study 3, we explored community research participants' beliefs about data sharing and credibility of science/scientists (N = 1,104). Participants were receptive of data sharing and viewed psychological science favorably. Conclusions: We provide data-driven recommendations for researchers to assemble the best tools for approaching the knowledge-production process with transparency, humility, and cultural competency.

AB In the trend of academic entrepreneurship, practical and direct contribution of university research to the society has been emphasized, in which university scientists have increasingly engaged in commercial activities, university-industry relationships, and technology transfers. However, this trend has aroused concern about a potentially negative impact on the tradition of open science. Drawing on a survey data of 698 Japanese natural scientists, this study analyzes the behaviors and norms of university scientists under the influence of university interventions for entrepreneurship, whereby examining the compatibility between entrepreneurship and open science. The results indicate that entrepreneurial interventions have facilitated scientists' norm for practical contribution, and consequently, their involvement in commercial activities and ties with industry. Then, some, but not all, of these entrepreneurial activities have deterred cooperative or open relationships between scientists. However, the results suggest that the entrepreneurial interventions have not deteriorated the traditional norm for open science. Further analyses indicate that the two norms for practical contribution and for open science are determined independently, implying that academic entrepreneurship can be promoted without deteriorating open science.

TI Open science versus commercialization: a modern research conflict?
SO GENOME MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID ACADEMIC RESEARCH; IMPACT; UK
AB Background: Efforts to improve research outcomes have resulted in genomic researchers being confronted with complex and seemingly contradictory instructions about how to perform their tasks. Over the past decade, there has been increasing pressure on university researchers to commercialize their work. Concurrently, they are encouraged to collaborate, share data and disseminate new knowledge quickly (that is, to adopt an open science model) in order to foster scientific progress, meet humanitarian goals, and to maximize the impact of their research.
   Discussion: We present selected guidelines from three countries (Canada, United States, and United Kingdom) situated at the forefront of genomics to illustrate this potential policy conflict. Examining the innovation ecosystem and the messages conveyed by the different policies surveyed, we further investigate the inconsistencies between open science and commercialization policies.
   Summary: Commercialization and open science are not necessarily irreconcilable and could instead be envisioned as complementary elements of a more holistic innovation framework. Given the exploratory nature of our study, we wish to point out the need to gather additional evidence on the coexistence of open science and commercialization policies and on its impact, both positive and negative, on genomics academic research.

AB Diverse funding sources, including the government, nonprofit, and industry sectors support academic research, generally, and gambling research, specifically. This funding allows academic researchers to assess gambling-related problems in populations, evaluate tools designed to encourage responsible gambling behaviors, and develop evidence-based recommendations for gambling-related topics. Some stakeholders have raised concern about industry-funded research. These critics argue that industry funding might influence the research process. Such concerns have led to the development of research guidelines that aim to preserve academic independence. Concurrently and independently, researchers have begun to embrace 'Open Science' practices (e.g. pre-registration of research questions and hypotheses, open access to materials and data) to foster transparency and create a valid, reliable, and replicable scientific literature. We suggest that Open Science principles and practices can be integrated with existing guidelines for industry-funded research to ensure that the research process is ethical, transparent, and unbiased. In the current paper, we engage with the aforementioned issues and present a formal framework to guide industry-funded research. We outlineGuidelines forResearchIndependence andTransparency (GRIT), which integrates Open Science practices with existing guidelines for industry-funded research. Specifically, we describe how particular Open Science practices can enhance industry-funded research, including research pre-registration, separation of confirmatory and exploratory analyses, open materials, open data availability, and open access to study manuscripts. We offer our guidelines in the context of industry-funded gambling studies, yet researchers can extend these ideas to the behavioral sciences, more generally, and to funding sources of any type.

AB Objectives Questionable research practices (QRPs) lead to incorrect research results and contribute to irreproducibility in science. Researchers and institutions have proposed open science practices (OSPs) to improve the detectability of QRPs and the credibility of science. We examine the prevalence of QRPs and OSPs in criminology, and researchers' opinions of those practices. Methods We administered an anonymous survey to authors of articles published in criminology journals. Respondents self-reported their own use of 10 QRPs and 5 OSPs. They also estimated the prevalence of use by others, and reported their attitudes toward the practices. Results QRPs and OSPs are both common in quantitative criminology, about as common as they are in other fields. Criminologists who responded to our survey support using QRPs in some circumstances, but are even more supportive of using OSPs. We did not detect a significant relationship between methodological training and either QRP or OSP use. Support for QRPs is negatively and significantly associated with support for OSPs. Perceived prevalence estimates for some practices resembled a uniform distribution, suggesting criminologists have little knowledge of the proportion of researchers that engage in certain questionable practices. Conclusions Most quantitative criminologists in our sample have used QRPs, and many have used multiple QRPs. Moreover, there was substantial support for QRPs, raising questions about the validity and reproducibility of published criminological research. We found promising levels of OSP use, albeit at levels lagging what researchers endorse. The findings thus suggest that additional reforms are needed to decrease QRP use and increase the use of OSPs.

AB This study aimed to analyze the content of data availability statements (DAS) and the actual sharing of raw data in preprint articles about COVID-19. The study combined a bibliometric analysis and a cross-sectional survey. We analyzed preprint articles on COVID-19 published on medRxiv and bioRxiv from January 1, 2020 to March 30, 2020. We extracted data sharing statements, tried to locate raw data when authors indicated they were available, and surveyed authors. The authors were surveyed in 2020-2021. We surveyed authors whose articles did not include DAS, who indicated that data are available on request, or their manuscript reported that raw data are available in the manuscript, but raw data were not found. Raw data collected in this study are published on Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/6ztec/). We analyzed 897 preprint articles. There were 699 (78%) articles with Data/Code field present on the website of a preprint server. In 234 (26%) preprints, data/code sharing statement was reported within the manuscript. For 283 preprints that reported that data were accessible, we found raw data/code for 133 (47%) of those 283 preprints (15% of all analyzed preprint articles). Most commonly, authors indicated that data were available on GitHub or another clearly specified web location, on (reasonable) request, in the manuscript or its supplementary files. In conclusion, preprint servers should require authors to provide data sharing statements that will be included both on the website and in the manuscript. Education of researchers about the meaning of data sharing is needed.

AB Opening data promises to improve research rigour and democratize knowledge production. But it also presents practical, theoretical, and ethical considerations for qualitative researchers in particular. Discussion about open data in qualitative social psychology predates the replication crisis. However, the nuances of this ongoing discussion have not been translated into current journal guidelines on open data. In this article, we summarize ongoing debates about open data from qualitative perspectives, and through a content analysis of 261 journals we establish the state of current journal policies for open data in the domain of social psychology. We critically discuss how current common expectations for open data may not be adequate for establishing qualitative rigour, can introduce ethical challenges, and may place those who wish to use qualitative approaches at a disadvantage in peer review and publication processes. We advise that future open data guidelines should aim to reflect the nuance of arguments surrounding data sharing in qualitative research, and move away from a universal "one-size-fits-all" approach to data sharing. This article outlines the past, present, and the potential future of open data guidelines in social-psychological journals. We conclude by offering recommendations for how journals might more inclusively consider the use of open data in qualitative methods, whilst recognizing and allowing space for the diverse perspectives, needs, and contexts of all forms of social-psychological research.

AB Young researchers of today will shape the field in the future. In light of current debates about social psychology's research culture, this exploratory survey assessed early-career researchers' beliefs (N = 88) about the prevalence of questionable research practices (QRPs), potential causes, and open science as a possible solution. While there was relative consensus that outright fraud is an exception, a majority of participants believed that some QRPs are moderately to highly prevalent what they attributed primarily to academic incentive structures. A majority of participants felt that open science is necessary to improve research practice. They indicated to consider some open science recommendations in the future, but they also indicated some reluctance. Limitation and implications of these findings are discussed.

AB Addressing global scientific challenges requires the widespread sharing of consistent and trustworthy research data. Identifying the factors that influence widespread data sharing will help us understand the limitations and potential leverage points. We used two well-known theoretical frameworks, the Theory of Planned Behavior and the Technology Acceptance Model, to analyze three DataONE surveys published in 2011, 2015, and 2020. These surveys aimed to identify individual, social, and organizational influences on data-sharing behavior. In this paper, we report on the application of multiple factor analysis (MFA) on this combined, longitudinal, survey data to determine how these attitudes may have changed over time. The first two dimensions of the MFA were named willingness to share and satisfaction with resources based on the contributing questions and answers. Our results indicated that both dimensions are strongly influenced by individual factors such as perceived benefit, risk, and effort. Satisfaction with resources was significantly influenced by social and organizational factors such as the availability of training and data repositories. Researchers that improved in willingness to share are shown to be operating in domains with a high reliance on shared resources, are reliant on funding from national or federal sources, work in sectors where internal practices are mandated, and live in regions with highly effective communication networks. Significantly, satisfaction with resources was inversely correlated with willingness to share across all regions. We posit that this relationship results from researchers learning what resources they actually need only after engaging with the tools and procedures extensively.

AB Like the US before it, Japan has adopted a series of policy initiatives designed to encourage the commercialization of academic science. However, such initiatives may also adversely affect "open-science". Based on matched surveys of almost 1000 researchers in Japan and over 800 in the US, the paper examines rates of commercial activity, reasons to patent, and secrecy related to research results. In particular, it examines the extent to which participation in commercial activity is associated with publication secrecy. The results show that patenting rates are higher in Japan, while industry funding is more common in the US. In addition, the overall level of publication secrecy is greater in Japan. And, in both countries, individuals who are commercially active are less likely to share their research results through publication. But, patents are less directly linked to commercial activity in Japan than in the US, and have less impact on academic secrecy. The results suggest that academic entrepreneurship is associated with reduced participation in open science, but that the extent of adverse effects depends significantly on institutional context.

AB This study investigates undergraduate students' attitudes towards and experiences with open education practices (OEP) in a research-based linguistics seminar. Data was collected through written assignments in which two groups of students in subsequent terms were surveyed on their willingness to publish (a) academic posters in open access (OA); (b) teaching concepts as open educational resources (OER); and (c) personal reflections on the research process in OA. Through qualitative data analysis, we examine students' apprehensions and motivations to publish their artifacts. We find that key motivators are a sense of belonging, personal reward, and an active contribution to a culture of collaboration, whereas apprehensions are grounded in concerns about the quality of their work, uncertainties about licensing, and fear of vulnerability through visibility. We show that open science practices and OEP can be combined synergistically in process-oriented, research-based, and collaborative seminar concepts, and we formulate recommendations for lecturers on how to successfully address OEP in the classroom.

AB An updated metric developed to assess the degree of open data reusability, called MEtric for the evaLuation of Open DAta: Meloda 5 is presented. Previous version of the metric, Meloda 4, had six dimensions: the legal licensing of data, the mechanisms to access the data, the technical standards of the datasets, the data model, the geographic content of the data and the updating frequency. With all these dimensions, the metric provides a quantitative evaluation about how reusable the datasets released are. During the last five years, this metric has been cited and used by some other authors but the extensive use of the metric has brought to light some of its limitations. In order to get deeper insights into the topic, a panel of international experts has been surveyed about two aspects of the metric. First aspect was what other factors should be considered in order to qualify the reusability of a released dataset. And the second aspect was the internal structure, the levels for every dimension of the metric; if they should be increased, merged, removed or divided. Considering the results of the survey, first, we identify the factors / dimensions that should be kept: legal licensing, access to information, technical standard, standardization, geolocation content and updating frequency of data. Second, we consider the inclusion of two new dimensions: dissemination and reputation. Then, we present the new internal structure, the levels for each dimension, and the measures to evaluate the degree of reuse of each dataset. Finally, a standardization of the metric for other steps of the data impact process, data reuse analytics and data-driven services generation are presented together with future research lines.

He therefore invites them to reconsider the methods they use to remain true to their core original mission: "evidence based decision-making". To this end, the author shows how "open data" may help in doing so.

AB Whereas recent scholarly research has provided many insights about universities engaging in commercial activities, there is still little empirical evidence regarding the opposite phenomenon of companies disseminating scientific knowledge. Our paper aims to fill this gap and explores the motivations of firms that disclose research outcomes in a scientific format. Besides considering a dimension internal to the firm, we focus particularly on knowledge sourcing from academic institutions and the appropriability regime. We conduct an econometric analysis with firm-level data from the fourth edition of the French innovation survey (CIS) and matched scientific publications for a sample of 2512 R&D performing firms from all manufacturing sectors. This analysis provides evidence that firms are more likely to adopt academic principles if they need to access scientific knowledge that is considered important for their innovation development, whereas the mere existence of collaborative links with academic institutions is not a strong determinant. Furthermore, the results suggest that the inclination of firms to publish is sensitive to the level of knowledge spillovers in a sector and the effectiveness of legal appropriation instruments.

AB Introduction: Although chiropractic care is known to be provided in different types of environments, patient satisfaction on the use of an open plan/multi bedded environment is unknown. The aim of this study was to examine chiropractic patients' beliefs, experiences and satisfaction with chiropractic care in an open environment and to test the hypothesis that a patient's privacy and dignity may be preserved in open adjusting environments.
   Methods: A convenience sample of twenty-seven European chiropractors from 8 European countries was obtained through 2 national association e-mail lists and verbal request at 2 continuing education seminars. They and their patients were asked to complete a Global Wellness and Likert-type survey for the purpose of this study.
   Results: One thousand, one hundred and nine patients who received chiropractic care in an open environment participated in this study. They reported to be very highly satisfied with the care they were receiving (average rating = 8.98/10) and expressed significantly improved survey responses in regard to their self-rated Global Wellness at the time of evaluation compared to baseline measures. In terms of their attitudes, beliefs and experiences in this model of chiropractic care, participants indicated positive experiences in that they were comfortable receiving care in such an environment, their dignity was respected, their privacy maintained and they were cared for in a professional manner.
   Conclusions: The findings presented here provide valuable insight into patients' perspectives in receiving care in an open adjusting environment. Our results demonstrate that the open adjusting environment is an effective practice model for maintaining a patient's dignity and privacy while providing a high level of patient satisfaction. Open room care may need to be included in future decisions regarding best practice configuration for chiropractic care facilities. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB The promise of open data is grand, but the results are often meager. To resolve this conundrum and make headway in the adoption of effective open data practices, we take a step back and investigate the underlying reasons for investing in open data. Based on survey results, interviews, and complementary evidence from secondary sources, we explore the motives and beliefs about open data investment expressed by open data experts in both public and private organizations. To our surprise, in both public and private organizations we find that open data investments are driven more by legitimacy-seeking than a quest to realize the value creation potential of open data. The results are worrisome, as such motives and beliefs do not necessarily lead to investment in the complementary assets needed to realize the potential associated with open data-instead, open data risks becoming a lost opportunity. Clearly, it's time to move beyond the open data hype and get down to business. Our paper provides insights for practice and calls on future research to unpack antecedents and mechanisms for value creation, and to identify appropriate complementary investments in open data, for example in terms of technologies, tools, and systems.

AB The purpose of this research is to investigate the attitudinal, normative, and resource factors affecting psychologists' adoption of an open data badge. The theory of planned behavior was employed to demonstrate how these factors influence behavioral intentions to adopt an open data badge. This research used a survey method to examine to what extent those attitudinal, normative, resource factors influence psychologists' behavioral intentions to adopt an open data badge, and therefore engage in data sharing behaviors. A national survey (n= 341) across the field of psychology showed that perceived benefit and perceived risk had significant positive and negative relationships with attitude toward the open data badge respectively. Furthermore, attitude toward open data badge and norm of data sharing had significant positive influences on psychologists' behavioral intentions to adopt the open data badge. Perceived effort had a significant negative relationship with the behavioral intention to adopt the open data badge, but had no effect toward attitudes surrounding the badge. However, this research found that the availability of a data repository and pressure from an open science journal did not have any significant relationship with behavioral intention to adopt the open data badge. The discussion includes implications for psychologists from both practical and theoretical perspectives. Additionally, future directions for gauging psychologists' adoption of the open data badge and increasing data sharing behaviors are discussed.

AB Background Understanding students' naive conceptions about the norms that guide scientific best practice is important so that teachers can adapt to students' existing understandings. Objective We examined what incoming undergraduate students of psychology believe about reproducibility and open science practices. Method We conducted an online survey with participants who were about to start their first course in psychology at a university (N = 239). Results When asked to indicate how a researcher should conduct her study, most students endorsed several open science practices. When asked to estimate the proportion of published psychological studies that follow various open science practices, participants' estimates averaged near 50%. Only 18% of participants reported that they had heard the term "replication crisis." Conclusion Despite media attention about the replication crisis, few incoming psychology students in our sample were familiar with the term. The students were nevertheless in favour of most open science practices, although they overestimated the prevalence of some of these practices in psychology. Teaching Implications Teachers of incoming psychology students should not assume pre-existing knowledge about open science or replicability.

AB This study investigates the roles of academic libraries in propagating Open Science. The study is a qualitative survey based on literature review. Various definitions of open science from different scholars and schools of thought were examined. Research articles on the effects of open science on research and the place of academic libraries in scientific research were reviewed. Open science enhances collaborations and sharing of resources among researchers. Metadata related activities are more prevalent due to open science. Open science has increased the relevance of science to our environment and world issues like privacy and the rightful author of scientific data are still some of the challenges facing open science. Academic libraries continue to take steps to be involved as key players in the propagation of open science through advocacy, building of institutional data repositories and serving as hubs for scientific collaboration among others. Academic libraries have to do more in the area of advocacy and provision of data repositories.

AB Urban flooding in developing countries represents a growing threat to sustainable development efforts, yet the tools needed to study these infrastructure systems in data-scarce environments are woefully inadequate. This study seeks to propose a standardized approach and methods for mapping urban drainage systems in developing communities. The research draws on a case study from the Philippines, which sought to conduct rapid elevation surveys and drainage assessments employing open source geographical information system (GIS) tools. We develop a standardized procedure for digitizing drainage systems using OpenStreetMap and Field Papers, as well as discuss applications of this data for drainage design. The results contribute to a methodological framework that can be replicated in other similar developing communities where study of urban drainage is needed for sustainable development and disaster risk reduction efforts.

AB The integration of technologies in education brings organizational changes not only in traditional classrooms, but also in digital platforms, and invites to locate opportunities for educational innovation. This article aims to identify the perception of 206 participants of an international Open Education (OE) program and to contribute to UNESCO's (2019) recommendations for OE and science, with possibilities for technological enablers. The guiding questions in this study were: what are the challenges, cases, and experiences that participants perceive as drivers of OE? In what ways can technologies enable OE within the framework of UNESCO recommendations? A parallel mixed method was carried out with an initial phase analyzing qualitative and quantitative data with a perception instrument applied to the participants. The second phase comprises a literature search to locate research that uses technologies in OE and to provide an outline of technological enablers. The results were: (a) the greatest perceived challenges are "Promoting the culture of open access" and "Promoting international cooperation"; (b) 46 contributions from participants with cases to promote OE stand out and (c) contribution of six research studies to promote UNESCO's recommendations with technologies and (d) a classification scheme of technological enablers 4.0 for education is proposed. This article is intended to be of interest to educational communities, ministries of education and science, researchers, and trainers interested in educational innovation.

ID IMPACT
AB Many European countries have introduced Open Science (OS) policies to improve the quality and efficiency of science and to increase economic and societal growth. Researchers' perceptions and experiences of OS policies remain relatively under-investigated. This explorative study applies the policy alienation perspective to understand researchers' perceptions of OS policy implementation. Analysis of survey responses indicates that researchers have difficulties in coping with OS policy and that they feel policy alienation from OS policy. Hence, researchers may be less willing to try to support OS policy implementation despite the fact that OS policies are motivated by the desire to enhance the excellence and quality of research. The findings address how the incentive problems lie not only in the research evaluation and academic credit systems but also in the policy-practice divide. These problems need to be solved in terms of participation in policymaking and in the knowledge production of 'openness' itself.

ID OPEN GOVERNMENT DATA; MODELS
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to study a multi-institutional and multi-layer nature of open data-driven communication processes that provide a collaborative platform to meet the interests of various stakeholders in advancing public sector innovations, namely, government agents, citizens, independent developers, non-governmental organizations, mass media and businesses alike and understand an important role of mutually beneficial public-private partnerships in the area.
   Design/methodology/approach - This is a case study research, which itself is based on a combinative approach, especially in applying, in a successive order, two methods of investigation, namely, stakeholder and policy analysis. In general, the combination of these two research techniques is useful in understanding the most important collaborative trends in the area and locating key institutional drivers and challenges that open data policymakers face today in implementing related digital collaborative and participatory platforms.
   Findings - The open data concept could provide a promising collaborative platform to network various e-government stakeholders and accelerate related technology-driven public reforms. The successful implementation of the idea demands a fairly equal contribution from representatives of both public and private sectors of economy. The case has also clearly demonstrated the importance of cooperation with the local non-governmental sector, independent developers and journalists, whose active participation is a key factor for the overall progress of the open data phenomenon, to a greater degree, as a collaborative movement rather than an instrument of public sector innovations.
   Research limitations/implications - One of the fundamental limitations of the investigation is that it is a single case study. It explores the development of open data phenomena in the context of such an advanced post-industrial society as Finland. In this regard, in order to support key arguments of the research, it is necessary to compare its findings with the results of similar case studies in other administrative, political and socioeconomic settings, which would open new promising dimensions for future research in this direction.
   Practical implications - Policy recommendations are proposed by the author in the discussion section, which could help, for example, to boost information campaigns in popularizing open data technologies and its reuse among independent developers. A lot of unique visualizations and illustrations are presented in the paper to help readers grasp better key ideas of the research. In this respect, the paper is intended for a global professional community of open data experts, e-government specialists, political scientists, journalists, lawyers, students of public policy and public administration and all those who are interested in studying the phenomenon from the perspective of its key stakeholders.
   Social implications - The author of the paper tried to develop a universal framework of case study research that could be used in investigating phenomena of open data not only in Finland but also in the context of other post-industrial societies, especially in analyzing roles of various stakeholders in adopting open data-driven collaborative and civic engagement platforms and startups.
   Originality/value - This research presents a first case study that investigates a collaborative potential of open data phenomena from a stakeholder perspective in a more holistic manner, especially in analyzing professional networking platforms and related communication activities that meet the interests of stakeholders as diverse as government agents and journalists, independent developers and academia, charities and businesses in an attempt to better understand the fundamental factors of the open data movement as a collaborative socioeconomic trend.

AB Buildings are by far the largest source of urban energy consumption. In an effort to reduce energy use, cities are mandating that buildings undergo energy benchmarking-the process of measuring building energy performance in order to identify buildings that are inefficient. In this paper, we examine the feasibility of using city-specific, public open data sources in two benchmarking models and compare the results to the same models when using the Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) dataset, the basis for Energy Star. The two benchmarking models use datasets containing building characteristics and annual energy use from ten major cities. To examine the difference in performance between linear and non-linear models, we use random forest and lasso regression. Results demonstrate that benchmarking models using open data outperform models based solely on the CBECS dataset. Additionally, our results indicate that building area, property type, conditioned area, and water usage are the most important variables for cities to collect. Having demonstrated the benefits of using open data, we recommend two changes to current benchmarking practices: (1) new guidelines that support a data-driven benchmarking framework relying on open data and a transparent modeling process and (2) supporting policies that publicize benchmarking results and incentivize energy savings.

AB This research explored the readiness towards the implementation of open science initiatives in the Malaysian Comprehensive Public Universities; both quantitative and qualitative research methods were implemented. The survey questionnaire was distributed to the academic researchers and library professionals from the selected universities and a semi-structured interview was conducted with the heads of the libraries together with their deputies to complement the first method. The findings indicate that the public universities in the country were partially involved with open science, even though the term is still new to most of the participants. The Institutional Repository is the commonly known means through which these universities promote and practice open science, although only 10% to 30% of the contents were made available to the general public. However, these institutions are currently working on implementing a policy on how to operate and fully engage other aspects of the open science practices, such as open data, open collaboration, open innovation, and the likes.

AB The type, the nature, and the amount of information at the disposal of tourists have exploded, overwhelming them with the number of choices and making trip planning a very challenging task. Recommender systems offer personalized recommendations and help individuals overcome this information overload. The deployment of such systems in the hotel industry needs to satisfy specific constraints making the direct application of classical approaches insufficient. Travelers recurrently fall into the cold-start status due to the volatility of interest and the change in attitudes depending on the context. Events have been playing an essential role in drawing attention to specific regions and constitute a major motive to organize trips. In this paper, we explore for the first time the benefits of introducing open data related to events into hotel recommender systems. We address in particular two problems, the hotel-centric and the event-centric problems, where we recommend pairs of hotels and events in order to facilitate the tourism planning and enhance the travelers' experience. We first collect data related to events and filter those susceptible of attracting people. We then develop a novel framework that infers events' affinities based on hotel booking data and rely on the mass behavior to make personalized suggestions. Finally, we demonstrate our framework by performing a qualitative and a quantitative evaluation. Improvements in the quality of recommendation show the advantage of leveraging event data for hotel recommendation and illustrate the opportunities of using open data for tourism planning.

AB The purpose of this study was to find out: (a) pupils' attitudes towards open-ended science investigations, and (b) the problems that pupils encounter when carrying out such investigations in groups. The study was conducted in a class of 39 primary 6 pupils of mixed ability who carried out four investigations. Data were based on pupils' responses on an attitude survey questionnaire, interviews, video tapes of pupils performing the investigations and field notes. The majority of the pupils liked conducting such investigations. Reasons for positive responses were that the pupils had the freedom to explore and devise their own procedures to find out things that they wanted to know about, they could work together and discuss with friends, the investigations were interesting and it was a valuable learning experience. Reasons for negative responses included the difficulty of coming up with good ideas to design the investigations, and group conflicts. The findings also indicate that group dynamics played an important role in influencing pupils' attitudes towards the investigations.

ID ATTITUDES; DEFICIT; SOCIETY
AB Recent arguments for responsible innovation to progress beyond the narrow focus on open access and toward open science present the opportunity for a deliberate global transition to a culture of transparent and open scientific conduct that will deliver greater societal benefit. This paper presents results from a survey of 171 Australian scientists, researchers and other professionals on their expectations and perspectives of transparency and openness in current scientific research practice. The results suggest that for this cultural transition to occur, the responsibility for strengthening transparency and openness must be undertaken not only by scientists and researchers, but also research funding and delivery agencies, and even those beyond the research and innovation sector. These findings are a first step towards defining and understanding what open science means in an Australian context, and what shifts are needed from researchers, research institutions and policy makers to move toward open science for responsible innovation.

AB The field of electric vehicle charging load modelling has been growing rapidly in the last decade. In light of the Paris Agreement, it is crucial to keep encouraging better modelling techniques for successful electric vehicle adoption. Additionally, numerous papers highlight the lack of charging station data available in order to build models that are consistent with reality. In this context, the purpose of this article is threefold. First, to provide the reader with an overview of the open datasets available and ready to be used in order to foster reproducible research in the field. Second, to review electric vehicle charging load models with their strengths and weaknesses. Third, to provide suggestions on matching the models reviewed to six datasets found in this research that have not previously been explored in the literature. The open data search covered more than 860 repositories and yielded around 60 datasets that are relevant for modelling electric vehicle charging load. These datasets include information on charging point locations, historical and real-time charging sessions, traffic counts, travel surveys and registered vehicles. The models reviewed range from statistical characterization to stochastic processes and machine learning and the context of their application is assessed.

ID ACCESS
AB Legislatures, those bodies of elected officials, are increasingly attuned to the rhetoric of open data for legislative content like bills and Hansards. This rhetoric dictates that government content should be freely accessible, repurposable, machine-readable, standardized across subregions, and available without licensing restrictions. Canada offers an excellent example of renewed emphasis on openness across jurisdictions. The call for legislative openness also derives from open data advocates, who seek to apply the rules of open data to unstructured information. We do not know whether legislative openness in Canada, at the provincial and territorial level, matches the rhetoric of open data. This study focused on commonly occurring categories of information on subnational legislative websites, and examined their copyright, availability, archivability, information timeliness, and plain language descriptions. Legislatures were contacted about current practices in the form of a web survey with follow-up phone interviews. We collected additional information via a web content analysis. Results indicated that a considerable amount of information was available, although generally at minimal levels of compliance and with significant variance across legislatures. Respondents expressed confusion about the extent of actual versus perceived openness of their information. We hope these findings provoke a subnational dialogue on legislative openness across Canada.
   Relier l'ouverture legislative a celle des donnees ouvertes au Canada Les legislatures, ces organismes de representants elus, sont de plus en plus sensibilisees a la rhetorique des donnees ouvertes pour les contenus legislatifs tels que les projets de loi et les comptes-rendus des debats. Cette rhetorique stipule que le contenu gouvernemental devrait etre accessible gratuitement, adaptable, lisible par machine, normalise entre les sous-regions et disponible sans restriction liee a l'octroi de licence. Le Canada offre un excellent exemple de regain d'ouverture entre les provinces et les territoires. L'appel lance pour une ouverture legislative decoule egalement des promoteurs des donnees ouvertes qui tentent d'appliquer les regles des donnees ouvertes a l'information non structuree. Nous ne savons pas si l'ouverture legislative au Canada, au niveau des provinces et des territoires, correspond a la rhetorique des donnees ouvertes. La presente etude a mis l'accent sur les categories d'information les plus courantes sur les sites Web legislatifs infranationaux et a examine leurs droits d'auteur, leur disponibilite, leur qualite d'archivage, leur rapidite a publier de l'information et leurs descriptions en langage simple. On a communique avec les legislatures au sujet des pratiques courantes lors d'une enquete sur le Web avec des entrevues de suivi par telephone. Nous avons collecte de l'information additionnelle au moyen d'une analyse du contenu Web. Les resultats indiquaient qu'une quantite considerable d'information etait disponible meme si c'etait generalement a des niveaux minimaux de conformite et avec des ecarts importants entre les legislatures. Les repondants ont fait part de leur confusion au sujet de l'etendue de l'ouverture reelle par rapport a l'ouverture percue de leur information. Nous esperons que ces conclusions entraineront un dialogue infranational sur l'ouverture legislative a l'echelle du Canada.

AB Objectives: To identify the engagement of health sciences librarians (HSLs) in open science (OS) through the delivery of library services, support, and programs for researchers. Methods: We performed a scoping review guided by Arksey and O'Malley's framework and Joanna Briggs' Manual for Scoping Reviews. Our search methods consisted of searching five bibliographic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LISTA, and Web of Science Core Collection), reference harvesting, and targeted website and journal searching. To determine study eligibility, we applied predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria and reached consensus when there was disagreement. We extracted data in duplicate and performed qualitative analysis to map key themes. Results: We included fifty-four studies. Research methods included descriptive or narrative approaches (76%); surveys, questionnaires, and interviews (15%); or mixed methods (9%). We labeled studies with one or more of FOSTER's six OS themes: open access (54%), open data (43%), open science (24%), open education (6%), open source (6%), and citizen science (6%). Key drivers in OS were scientific integrity and transparency, openness as a guiding principle in research, and funder mandates making research publicly accessible. Conclusions: HSLs play key roles in advancing OS worldwide. Formal studies are needed to assess the impact of HSLs' engagement in OS. HSLs should promote adoption of OS within their research communities and develop strategic plans aligned with institutional partners. HSLs can promote OS by adopting more rigorous and transparent research practices of their own. Future research should examine HSLs' engagement in OS through social justice and equity perspectives.

AB Purpose - This paper seeks to discuss the question of "openness" in e-Science.
   Design/methodology/approach - The study is based on 12 in-depth interviews with principal investigators, project managers and developers involved in UK e-Science projects, together with supporting documentary evidence from project web sites. The approach was to explore the juxtaposition of research governance at the institutional level and local research practices at the project level. Interview questions focused on research inputs, software development processes, access to resources, project documentation, dissemination of outputs and by-products, licensing issues, and institutional contracts.
   Findings - The findings suggest that, although there is a widely shared ethos of openness in everyday research practice, there are many uncertainties and yet-to-be resolved issues, despite strong policy imperatives towards openly shared resources.
   Research limitations/implications - The paper concludes by observing a stratification of openness in practice and the need for more nuanced understanding of openness at the level of policy making. This research was based on interviews within a limited number of e-Science/Social Science projects and the intention is to address this in future work by scaling the study up to a survey that will reach the entire UK e-Science/Social Science community.
   Practical implications - The fundamental challenge in resolving openness in practice and policy, land thereby moving towards a sustainable infrastructure for e-Science, is the coordination and integration of goals across e-Science efforts, rather than one of resolving IPR (Intellectual Property Rights) issues, which has been the central focus of openness debates thus far.
   Originality/value-The question of openness has previously been posed on the macro-level of research policy, e.g. whether science as a whole can be characterized as open science, or in relation to the dissemination of published outputs, e.g. Open Access. Instead, a fine-grained perspective is taken focusing on individual research projects and the various facets of openness in practice.

   behaviour framed by the FAIR Data Principles
SO INFORMATION RESEARCH-AN INTERNATIONAL ELECTRONIC JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID INFORMATION-SEEKING; ENGINEERS; ACCESS
AB Introduction. Data reuse in the natural sciences is necessary due to several factors-data volume, the often-real-time one-time collection, the associated collection costs, as well as data's long-term scientific value with many potential reuses across domains beyond its original purpose.
   Method. This study captures heuristics used by natural scientists to inform their discovery and reuse. Using a critical incident technique, forty-three scientists from biology, geology, and oceanography were asked to describe their most recent data discovery resulting in reuse.
   Analysis. To frame participants' behaviour along a sequence of actions from finding to reusing data, the survey used the FAIR Data Principles.
   Results. Results show a common lack of understanding of controlled vocabulary and a common determination of fitness of use by noting familiar sources rather than searching through extensive metadata.
   Conclusions. Scientists' perceptions of their discovery and reuse behaviour provide considerations for research and impact practice to inform the design of tools and services to improve data reuse by both humans and machines.

AB The extent to which findings in bilingualism research are contingent on specific analytic choices, experimental designs, or operationalisations, is currently unknown. Poor availability of data, analysis code, and materials has hindered the development of cumulative lines of research. In this review, we survey current practices and advocate a credibility revolution in bilingualism research through the adoption of minimum standards of transparency. Full disclosure of data and code is necessary not only to assess the reproducibility of original findings, but also to test the robustness of these findings to different analytic specifications. Similarly, full provision of experimental materials and protocols underpins assessment of both the replicability of original findings, as well as their generalisability to different contexts and samples. We illustrate the review with examples where good practice has advanced the agenda in bilingualism research and highlight resources to help researchers get started.

AB To address the low reproducibility and replicability of research, Open Science Practices (OSPs) have been developed. Yet, despite increasing awareness of their potential benefits, there has been only little implementation. As journals can act as gatekeepers for scientific discoveries, a potential tendency not to mention OSPs on their websites may help to explain this implementation gap. Therefore, we examined the implementation of OSPs and potential barriers in industrial and organizational psychology and management (IOP/management) journals. Study 1 examined whether and how N = 257 journal websites referred to OSPs. We found that most journals did not mention OSPs. Specifically, only two (1.0%), five (2.5%), and 14 (6.9%) IOP/management journals mentioned preregistration, registered reports, and explicitly welcomed replications, respectively. Study 2 investigated perceived barriers to implementing OSPs with a survey among editors of the IOP/management journals from Study 1. Among the 40 responding editors, 14, 10, and five attributed the lacking implementation of OSPs to a lesser suitability of OSPs for qualitative research, missing authority, and missing familiarity with OSPs, respectively. Based on our findings, the implementation gap could be mitigated by developing new and refining extant OSPs, starting bottom-up initiatives (e.g., researchers directly contacting publishers), and increasing the availability of information on OSPs.

AB Software systems are increasingly depending on data, particularly with the rising use of machine learning, and developers are looking for new sources of data. Open Data Ecosystems (ODE) is an emerging concept for data sharing under public licenses in software ecosystems, similar to Open Source Software (OSS). It has certain similarities to Open Government Data (OGD), where public agencies share data for innovation and transparency.
   We aimed to explore open data ecosystems involving commercial actors. Thus, we organized five focus groups with 27 practitioners from 22 companies, public organizations, and research institutes. Based on the outcomes, we surveyed three cases of emerging ODE practice to further understand the concepts and to validate the initial findings. The main outcome is an initial conceptual model of ODEs' value, intrinsics, governance, and evolution, and propositions for practice and further research.
   We found that ODE must be value driven. Regarding the intrinsics of data, we found their type, meta-data, and legal frameworks influential for their openness. We also found the characteristics of ecosystem initiation, organization, data acquisition and openness be differentiating, which we advise research and practice to take into consideration.

TI An Overview of the Current State of Linked and Open Data in Cataloging
SO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND LIBRARIES

DT Article
ID LIBRARY METADATA; BIBFRAME 2.0; QUALITY; FUTURE; CLASSIFICATION;
   REQUIREMENTS; SERVICES; LINKING; WEB
AB Linked Open Data (LOD) is a core Semantic Web technology that makes knowledge and information spaces of different knowledge domains manageable, reusable, shareable, exchangeable, and interoperable. The LOD approach achieves this through the provision of services for describing, indexing, organizing, and retrieving knowledge artifacts and making them available for quick consumption and publication. This is also aligned with the role and objective of traditional library cataloging. Owing to this link, major libraries of the world are transferring their bibliographic metadata to the LOD landscape. Some developments in this direction include the replacement of Anglo-American Cataloging Rules 2nd Edition by the Resource Description and Access (RDA) and the trend towards the wider adoption of BIBFRAME 2.0. An interesting and related development in this respect are the discussions among knowledge resources managers and library community on the possibility of enriching bibliographic metadata with socially curated or user-generated content. The popularity of Linked Open Data and its benefit to librarians and knowledge management professionals warrant a comprehensive survey of the subject. Although several reviews and survey articles on the application of Linked Data principles to cataloging have appeared in literature, a generic yet holistic review of the current state of Linked and Open Data in cataloging is missing. To fill the gap, the authors have collected recent literature (2014-18) on the current state of Linked Open Data in cataloging to identify research trends, challenges, and opportunities in this area and, in addition, to understand the potential of socially curated metadata in cataloging mainly in the realm of the Web of Data. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this review article is the first of its kind that holistically treats the subject of cataloging in the Linked and Open Data environment. Some of the findings of the review are: Linked and Open Data is becoming the mainstream trend in library cataloging especially in the major libraries and research projects of the world; with the emergence of Linked Open Vocabularies (LOV), the bibliographic metadata is becoming more meaningful and reusable; and, finally, enriching bibliographic metadata with user-generated content is gaining momentum. Conclusions drawn from the study include the need for a focus on the quality of catalogued knowledge and the reduction of the barriers to the publication and consumption of such knowledge, and the attention on the part of library community to the learning from the successful adoption of LOD in other application domains and contributing collaboratively to the global scale activity of cataloging.

AB Many new tools for improving the design and operation of buildings try to realize the potential of big data. In particular, data is an important element for occupant-centric design and operation as occupants' presence and actions are affected by a high degree of uncertainty and, hence, are hard to model in general. For such research, data handling is an important challenge, and following an open science paradigm based on open data can increase efficiency and transparency of scientific work. This article reviews current practices and infrastructure for open data-driven research on occupant-centric design and operation of buildings. In particular, it covers related work on open data in general and for the built environment in particular, presents survey results for existing scientific practices, reviews technical solutions for handling data and metadata, discusses ethics and privacy protection and analyses principles for the sharing of open data. In summary, this study establishes the status quo and presents an outlook on future work for methods and infrastructures to support the open data community within the built environment.

ID INCENTIVES
AB In recent years, there has been an intensive debate within psychology about the conclusions that should be drawn because of the replication crisis. The use of questionable research practices (QRPs) was identified as one reason for problems concerning replicability. While there are extensive studies on the prevalence of QRPs among scientists, little is known about their occurrence among students. This article presents the first large-scale survey among 1,397 psychology students in the German-speaking countries to investigate the occurrence of QRPs in student projects and the current state of academic teaching regarding the replication crisis and open science. The joint examination of teaching and the use of questionable research practices serves to provide information on how the teaching of psychology is related to the empirical approach of students. The results reveal that questionable research practices do occur in student projects, albeit with large differences in the occurrence of specific QRPs. We also found differences in the incidence of QRPs between different project types: QRP usage was most frequent in empirical internships and least frequent in master's theses. Our data suggest that the extent of reported QRPs generally decreases as students progress in their study programs. In addition, most students seem to have already come into contact with the replication crisis in teaching, mostly in methodology classes. Finally, we provide impulses for the further development of the teaching of psychology. The principles of openness, transparency, and collaboration play an important role in these recommendations, which are aimed at teaching and producing robust research from the very beginning.

AB Pillars of open science are often included within the editorial policies of scholarly journals, including policies on open access publication, availability of underlying research data, preprints and open peer review. The aim of this paper is to examine and analyse perceptions and editorial practices related to open access, preprints, open research data and open peer review, from the perspective of editors of scientific journals published in Spain, to gain an insight into editorial policies related to open science. Results and data were obtained by a combined method of online interviews and an online questionnaire. The online survey was sent to editors from journals indexed in the Dulcinea directory, which at the time of the study included 1875 academic journals. A total of 420 responses (22.4%) were obtained. The results indicated that 92% of the journals were open access journals, 2% of the journals conducted open peer review, 15% of the journals had instructions to allow archiving preprints, and out of 375 responses, only 59 journals (16%) reported having a policy on underlying research data. Based on these results, there is a trend in favour of open access, but the perceived barriers to open peer review outweighed the advantages. There is also some reluctance to allow preprints to be made available. This concern might be because editors want authors and readers to read and cite the contents published in their journals, rather than their preprint versions.

AB The current process of social transformation is driven by the growth of the culture of transparency and accountability, the socio-technological development of the web and the opening of public data. This situation forces the media to rethink their models of social intermediation, converting the growing open data access and user participation into new instruments that facilitate citizen empowerment. Open data can only generate citizen empowerment, facilitate decision-making and democratic action if it can provide value-added information to the citizens. Therefore, the aim of the research is to analyse the competencies necessary to develop information products created with open data. The study used a qualitative methodology based on two instruments: a survey of data journalism experts (university professors of journalism, journalism professional data, and experts in transparency), and an analysis of selected cases of information products created with open data. The results allow the identification of a series of conceptual, procedural and attitudinal skills needed to perform the tasks of collection, processing, analysis and presentation of data, which are necessary for the development of this type of information product, and which should be integrated into the training of future journalists.

AB Efforts to promote open-science practices are, to a large extent, driven by a need to reduce questionable research practices (QRPs). There is ample evidence that QRPs are corrosive because they make research opaque and therefore challenge the credibility, trustworthiness, and usefulness of the scientific knowledge that is produced. A literature based on false-positive results that will not replicate is not only scientifically misleading but also worthless for anyone who wants to put knowledge to use. So, a question then arises: Why are these QRPs still so pervasive and why do gatekeepers of scientific knowledge such as journal editors, reviewers, funding-agency panel members, and board members of professional organizations in charge of journal policies not seem to be taking decisive actions about QRPs? We address these questions by using a science-practice gap analogy to identify the existence of a science-practice gap in open science. Specifically, although there is abundant research on how to reduce QRPs, many gatekeepers are not adopting this knowledge in their practices. Drawing upon the literatures on the more general science-practice gap and QRPs, we offer 10 actionable recommendations for narrowing the specific science-practice gap in open science. Our recommendations require little effort, time, and financial resources. Importantly, they are explicit about the resulting benefits for the various research-production stakeholders (i.e., authors and gatekeepers). By translating findings on open-science research into actionable recommendations for "practitioners of research", we hope to encourage more transparent, credible, and reproducible research that can be trusted and used by consumers of that research.

AB Cybersecurity is no longer an issue discussed only between the professionals or technologists, but it is also closely related to ordinary people whose daily life is exposed to kinds of cyberattacks. And Womabat Security Technologies conducted a survey revealed that ransomware is an unknown concept to nearly two-thirds of employees. In practical, almost 95% of cybersecurity attacks are due to human error. At fact, expensive and sophisticated systems cannot work effectively without considering the human factor, while human factor is the major vulnerability in cybersecurity. Thus, it has great significance to give people cybersecurity awareness training. In this paper, we present a system, named ASURA, providing adaptive training aimed at improving cybersecurity awareness of people. Three issues can't be neglected in adaptive cybersecurity awareness training, as follows. Firstly, we need to decide the proper training contents from the huge training materials. Secondly, the training contents should be timely updated, as cyber attacks constantly changing. At last, we should conduct training through effective and acceptable approach. We solved above three issues in this paper, and the innovative idea of this paper is constructing hierarchical concept map from the LOD database DBpedia. Then, we employ a series of processing on hierarchical concept map, including PageRank algorithm used to calculate the importance of each concept node, and filtering used to filtered out undefined and unrelated concepts. In particular, we get training contents from DBpedia dynamically and timely updated, so that training contents is keeping up to date. ASURA delivered training contents completely online, thus significant trimmed budget and allowed learners accessing training outside of a traditional classroom. Moreover, ASURA provide adaptive training targeted to individual learner, as it generate training contents based on the keyword from the learner.

AB PurposeThe opening of government data is high on the policy agenda of governments worldwide. However, data release faces barriers due to limited support of civil servants, whereas the literature neglects civil servants' role in opening data. This paper aims at understanding why civil servants can be reluctant to support the disclosure of data. The authors developed a model to explain civil servants' behavioral intention to open data.Design/methodology/approachThe authors test a series of hypotheses by collecting and analyzing survey data from 387 civil servants and by applying multivariate hierarchical regression.FindingsThe results indicate the factors influencing the behavior of civil servants. Social influences, performance expectancy, data management knowledge and risks have a significant influence. Personal characteristics control these effects.Research limitations/implicationsCaution is needed to generalize the findings towards the support to open data provision by civil servants. Though the analyzed sample was limited to Brazil, other countries and cultures might yield different outcomes. Larger and more diversified samples might indicate significant effects on variables not found in this research.Practical implicationsThe insights can be used to develop policies for increasing the support of civil servants towards governmental data disclosure.Originality/valueThis study suggests factors of influence to civil servants' behavior intentions to disclose governmental data. It results in a model of factors, specifically for their behavioral intention at the individual level.

The estimated sharing rate was not far from totality (97.6% +/- 2.1%) and substantially higher than observed in other fields of genetic research (evolutionary, medical and forensic genetics). Both a questionnaire-based survey and the examination of Journals' editorial policies suggest that this high sharing rate cannot be simply explained by the need to comply with stakeholders requests. Most data were made available through body text, but the use of primary databases increased in coincidence with the introduction of complete mitochondrial and next-generation sequencing methods. Our study highlights three important aspects. First, our results imply that researchers' awareness of the importance of openness and transparency for scientific progress may complement stakeholders' policies in achieving very high sharing rates. Second, widespread data sharing does not necessarily coincide with a prevalent use of practices which maximize data findability, accessibility, useability and preservation. A detailed look at the different ways in which data are released can be very useful to detect failures to adopt the best sharing modalities and understand how to correct them. Third and finally, the case of human paleogenetics tells us that a widespread awareness of the importance of Open Science may be important to build reliable scientific practices even in the presence of complex experimental challenges.

DT Article
AB The Digital Initiative for Classics: Epic Speeches (DICES) research group reports here on preliminary work to integrate research on Greek and Latin epic speeches into the larger ecosystem of linked open data (LOD) for classical scholarship. The ability to collate speech data from different researchers and to leverage external repositories of texts and characters opens up new possibilities for interrogation of the epic corpus. We briefly survey the current state of scholarship on epic speeches and of the digital infrastructure on which we propose to build. We outline a model for harmonizing speech data across studies and aligning it with existing LOD standards. Finally, we discuss some early proof-of-concept results and the larger implications of this approach for the field. The long-term aim of the DICES project is to build a database of metadata on direct speech in Greek and Latin epic, not only covering canonical texts such as Homer and Virgil, but also including the less-studied texts of the late antique period, which will benefit greatly both from the increased accessibility and also from the diachronic perspective afforded by a corpus-based approach. The envisioned database also has the potential to include diachronic data from additional genres and languages at a later stage.

AB Mapping the spatial distribution of poverty and incomes within a country remains a challenge. Recently, several proposed methods incorporate features from satellite imagery to improve model performance (Babenko et al.,2017, Poverty mapping using convolutional neural networks trained on high and medium resolution satellite images, with an application in Mexico. ArXiv Preprint ArXiv:1711.06323) or supplant small area estimation methods (Jean et al.,2016, Combining satellite imagery and machine learning to predict poverty. Science, 353(6301), 790-94. doi:10.1126/science.aaf7894; Engstrom et al.,2017, Poverty from space: Using high-resolution satellite imagery for estimating economic well-being.). However, these methods require high-spatial resolution imagery which, given their cost and infrequent acquisition, may render these advances impractical for most applications. We investigate how small area estimates of average income may improve when incorporating features derived from Sentinel-2 and MODIS imagery. Both satellites provide free imagery, have global coverage, and a frequent revisit rate. We estimate a poverty map for Belize which incorporates spatial and time series features derived from these sensors, with and without survey derived variables. We document an 8% percent improvement in model performance when including these satellite features. We conclude by arguing that Open Data for Development should include open data pipelines where possible.

AB The past decade has witnessed a rapid development of open government data practices and academic research. However, there is no systematic survey of existing research to understand the evolution of open government data. Such research can facilitate knowledge transfer within and across domains, and foster learning for countries in the early stages of open government data development. This study quantitively extracted the evolution trajectory of open government data based on the main path analysis method and then analysed the underlying motivations. The results show that open government data research went through four main phases and that the open government data movement has spread towards developing countries and smart cities. Different challenges and issues faced by the researchers in each phase drove the evolution of open government data research. Finally, we discuss future directions of open government data research based on our findings and recent development. There is a tendency to create sustainable open government data and smartness by employing artificial intelligence and creating data marketplaces.
   Points for practitioners
   Open government data efforts have evolved over the years into a global phenomenon. Countries have learned from each other and more and more efforts are focused on innovating with open government data by stimulating co-creation and using other incentives. The way that data are opened should focus on achieving goals like innovation, participation, transparency and accountability. There is a tendency to create sustainable open government data and smartness by employing artificial intelligence and creating data marketplaces.

AB African countries like other developed nations are beginning to open up data towards attaining transparency and accountability. A better understanding by citizens of what a government does and the level of performance achieved can be better understood by making public sector data open. Citizens can therefore hold their government accountable for not meeting up with stated goals and misconducts. This study employs a survey through content analysis to evaluate the extent of implementation of open data portals. Variables used for the evaluation are Berners-Lee 5 star of open data, implementation technology, data formats, licensing, major data sets and functionality across the African continent. A total of twenty-two data portals from seventeen different countries were assessed. Seven of the data portals representing 32% of the total number of the data portals were implemented using Drupal tool (Dkan). About 60% of the portals under investigation are national initiatives, and Nigeria has the only regional/state initiative and the only two independent organisation data portals. The only two university related-initiatives as well as the only city-based data portal were from South Africa, while a specialised data portal dedicated to the Ebola crisis was captured from Sierra Leone. The dates for the creation of the data portals span from 2011 to the current year (2015). The result indicates that an appreciable effort is being made in the creation of data portals; however, more countries need to take the giant stride to data provisioning in the open formats. More data sets also need to be populated onto the portals. Movement towards attaining the 5 star status of open data portals is in progress but a lot needs to be done towards attaining this. There is also a need to complement the efforts of national governments, and this could be done by regional/state, cities, universities, and independent organisations.

AB In recent decades, the scientific community has become aware of the importance of science being effectively open in order to speed up scientific and technological progress. In this context, the achievement of a robust, effective and responsible form of data sharing is now widely acknowledged as a fundamental part of the research process. The production and resolution of human genomic data has steadily increased in recent years, mainly due to technological advances and decreasing costs of DNA genotyping and sequencing. There is, however, a downside to this process due to the huge increase in the complexity of the data and related metadata. This means it is advisable to go beyond traditional forms of sharing analysis, which have focused on data availability only. Here we present a pilot study that aims to complement a survey on the availability of data related to peer-reviewed publications with an analysis of their findability, accessibility, useability and assessability (according to the "intelligent data openness" scheme). Sharing rates in genomic anthropology (73.0%) were found to be higher than human genomics (32.4%), but lower than closely related research fields (from 96.8% to 79.2% for paleogenetics and evolutionary genetics, respectively). We discuss the privacy and methodological issues that could be linked to this finding. Comparisons of sharing rates across a wide range of disciplines has suggested that the idea of human genomics as a forerunner for the open data movement should be questioned. Finally, both in genomic anthropology and human genomics, findability and useability were found to be compliant with the expectations of an intelligent data openness, whereas only a minor part of studies met the need to make the data completely assessable.

AB Purpose This study aimed to present a model for open-data management for developing innovative information flow in Iranian knowledge-based companies (businesses). Design/methodology/approach The method was mixed (qualitative-quantitative) and data collection tools were interview and questionnaire. The qualitative part was done to identify the influential components in open data management (ecosystem) using the grounded theory method. A questionnaire was developed based on the results of the qualitative section and the theoretical foundations, and the quantitative section was conducted by analytical survey method and the model was extracted using factor analysis and the integration of the qualitative section. Findings Seven categories of entrepreneurial incentives, sustainable value, innovative features, challenges and barriers, actors, business model and requirements are the main categories that should be considered in open data management (ecosystem) with all categories of research have a significant relationship with open data management. Originality/value The study focused on open data management from an innovation paradigm perspective and its role in developing innovative information flow. The study aimed to identify the key components of the open data ecosystem, open-data value creation, and the need to use the "open data" approach to develop data-driven and knowledge-based businesses in Iran-an emerging approach largely ignored.

AB Psychology researchers are rapidly adopting open science practices, yet clear guidelines on how to apply these practices to meta-analysis remain lacking. In this tutorial, we describe why open science is important in the context of mew-analysis in psychology, and suggest how to adopt the 3 main components of open science: preregistration. open materials, and open data. We first describe how to make the preregistration as thorough as possible-and how to handle deviations from the plan. We then focus on creating easy-to-read materials (e.g., search syntax, R scripts) to facilitate reproducibility and bolster the impact of a meta-analysis. Finally, we suggest how to organize data (e.g., literature search results, data extracted from studies) that are easy to share, interpret, and update as new studies emerge.

TI Topographic Mapping Evolution: From Field and Photographically Collected
   Data to GIS Production and Linked Open Data
SO CARTOGRAPHIC JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
DE Topographic mapping; cartographic evolution; digital cartography;
   web-mapping; semantics
AB Whither the topographic map? Topographic mapping historically has been approached as a map factory operation through the period 1879-1990. During this time, data were field and photogrammetrically collected; cartographically verified and annotated creating a compilation manuscript; further edited, generalized, symbolized, and produced as a graphic output product using lithography, or more recently, through digital means. Adoption of geographic information systems (GIS) as the primary production process for topographic maps, including digital database preparation (1975-2000) and product generation operations (2001-present), has led to faster and more standardized production in a semi-automated process. However, the topographic product has remained the same static graphic. A new form of topographic map as an interactive, linked knowledge base is now being created. The appearance of the Semantic Web and Linked Open Data allows the map to become an interactive knowledge base. In this current theory and implementation of topographic mapping, the map is a graphics-based interface to a triplestore knowledge base which includes a topographic feature ontology, semantics and relations, and instance data with geometry and topology available. The topographic map graphic becomes an interactive link to the knowledge base and additional linked data through the Linked Open Data cloud.

AB Evidence-based policy uses intervention research to inform consequential decisions about resource allocation. Research findings are often published in peer-reviewed journals. Because detrimental research practices associated with closed science are common, journal articles report more false-positives and exaggerated effect sizes than would be desirable. Journal implementation of standards that promote open science-such as the transparency and openness promotion (TOP) guidelines-could reduce detrimental research practices and improve the trustworthiness of research evidence on intervention effectiveness. We evaluated TOP implementation at 339 peer-reviewed journals that have been used to identify evidence-based interventions for policymaking and programmatic decisions. Each of ten open science standards in TOP was not implemented in most journals' policies (instructions to authors), procedures (manuscript submission systems), or practices (published articles). Journals implementing at least one standard typically encouraged, but did not require, an open science practice. We discuss why and how journals could improve implementation of open science standards to safeguard evidence-based policy.

AB Background: Neighbourhood environments that support active living, such as walking or cycling for transportation, may decrease the burden of chronic conditions related to sedentary behaviour. Many measures exist to summarize features of communities that support active living, but few are pan-Canadian and none use open data sources that can be widely shared. This study reports the development and validation of a novel set of indicators of active living environments using open data that can be linked to national health surveys and can be used by local, regional or national governments for public health surveillance.
   Data and methods: A Geographic Information System (GIS) was used to calculate a variety of measures of the connectivity, density and proximity to destinations for 56,589 dissemination areas (DAs) across Canada (2016 data). Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to assess the association between each measure and the rates of walking to work and taking active transportation to work (a combination of walking, cycling and using public transportation) from census data. The active living environment measures selected for the final database were used to classify the DAs by the favourability of their active living environment into groups by k-medians clustering.
   Results: All measures were correlated with walking-to-work and active-transportation-to-work rates at the DA level, whether they were derived using proprietary or open data sources. Coverage of open data was consistent across Canadian regions. Three measures were selected for the Canadian Active Living Environments (Can-ALE) dataset based on the correlation analysis, but also on the principles of suitability for a variety of community sizes and openly available data: (1) three-way intersection density of roads and footpaths derived from OpenStreetMap (OSM), (2) weighted dwelling density derived from Statistics Canada dwelling counts and (3) points of interest derived from OSM. A measure of access to public transportation was added for the subset of DAs in larger urban areas and was strongly related to active-transportation-to-work rates. Active-transportation-to-work rates were graded, in steps, by the five Can-ALE groups derived from the cluster analysis, although walking-to-work rates exceeded the national average only in the most favourable active living environments.
   Interpretation: Open data may be used to derive measures that characterize the active living environments of Canadian communities.

AB This paper advocates for the value of open science in many areas of research. However, after briefly reviewing the fundamental principles underlying open science practices and their use and justification, the paper identifies four incompatibilities between those principles and scientific progress through applied research. The incompatibilities concern barriers to sharing and disclosure, limitations and deficiencies of overidentifying with hypothetico-deductive methods of inference, the paradox of replication efforts resulting in less robust findings, and changes to the professional research and publication culture such that it will narrow in favor of a specific style of research. Seven recommendations are presented to maximize the value of open science while minimizing its adverse effects on the advancement of science in practice.

AB This study aims to review the open science (OS) policy documents, identify their subject areas, and distinguish the topics of OS support policies in seven European countries, providing a platform for practical cooperation between countries in science popularization. With a qualitative-inductive approach, all pertinent policy documents in OS were collected through documentary study, and thematic analysis was conducted to identify OS policies for each country. Finally, forty-six policy documents extracted up to December 2020 were thematically analyzed through a qualitative-inductive case study. All selected countries had developed OS policies, and these supportive policies were generally related to the three dimensions of 'open input, open process, and open output'. In 'open input', recommendations for the performance of research data repositories, as well as management criteria, are considered. Most countries adopted 'open output' protectionist policies. Multiple policies in the 'open process' indicate the need for an appropriate OS platform.

ID REGRESSION
AB Crime has been a complex social problem worldwide, impacting numerous individuals in both property and psychology, and affecting public safety as well. To prevent and avoid crime is of great importance for urban authorities and citizens. Crime prediction using various urban sensing data provides a promising paradigm to cope with this challenging problem. However, previous studies on crime prediction mainly focus on coarse-grained prediction at the region level, which fail in fine-grained road-level crime inference due to data sparsity problems. This article proposes a road-level framework for fine-grained crime risk inference leveraging heterogeneous open data. We first extract a set of features from relevant external datasets and historical crime records, i.e., temporal, spatial, and recurrence crime features. We then establish a spatio-temporal crime pattern using spatio-temporal features, and further infer road-level crime risk incorporating with recurrence crime features. The framework not only considers a useful spatio-temporal pattern but also considers a unique crime near-repeat phenomenon, which helps address the data sparsity. We further present an application crime risk-aware route recommendation to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. This application cannot be solved well with coarse-grained (e.g., region-level) crime risk results since it is inconvenient for people to travel while avoiding large regions with potential crime risks. Experiments with the real-world datasets from New York City show that our framework accurately infers road-level crime risk and outperforms other baseline methods.

AB In the last 10 years, many canonical findings in the social sciences appear unreliable. This so-called "replication crisis" has spurred calls for open science practices, which aim to increase the reproducibility, replicability, and generalizability of findings. Communication research is subject to many of the same challenges that have caused low replicability in other fields. As a result, we propose an agenda for adopting open science practices in Communication, which includes the following seven suggestions: (1) publish materials, data, and code; (2) preregister studies and submit registered reports; (3) conduct replications; (4) collaborate; (5) foster open science skills; (6) implement Transparency and Openness Promotion Guidelines; and (7) incentivize open science practices. Although in our agenda we focus mostly on quantitative research, we also reflect on open science practices relevant to qualitative research. We conclude by discussing potential objections and concerns associated with open science practices.

AB Open science practices, such as pre-registration and data sharing, increase transparency and may improve the replicability of developmental science. However, developmental science has lagged behind other fields in implementing open science practices. This lag may arise from unique challenges and considerations of longitudinal research. In this paper, preliminary guidelines are provided for adapting open science practices to longitudinal research to facilitate researchers' use of these practices. The guidelines propose a serial and modular approach to registration that includes an initial pre-registration of the methods and focal hypotheses of the longitudinal study, along with subsequent pre- or co-registered questions, hypotheses, and analysis plans associated with specific papers. Researchers are encouraged to share their research materials and relevant data with associated papers and to report sufficient information for replicability. In addition, there should be careful consideration of requirements regarding the timing of data sharing, to avoid disincentivizing longitudinal research.

AB Open government is a form of permanent open communication between the administration and citizens, based on transparency from the administration, working with civil society and business. We present one of the key points that are being used to achieve this objective of participation: the open data movement. In Europe, its origins lie in the issuance of Directive 2003/98/EC of the European Parliament and the Council on access to and reuse of public sector information. Open data projects described here provide access to government data according to the recommendations of the W3C. The structure and open format allows data to be reused to provide new services to citizens and businesses. Numerous projects and visualization applications have been developed that realize the potential of this movement. The situation in Spain is emerging and even in a short period of time many initiatives are maturing. This offers us the opportunity to ask what role information managers will take on in this new scenario.

AB This reflection by a qualitative researcher stems from a concrete experience with data handling in a funded research project. The researcher followed Open Research Data guidelines and found optimal solutions to pseudonymise data, but this later evolved into a deep epistemological questioning on praxis. During the first phase of the project, a tailor-made software was developed with help from librarians and an IT professional to automate the pseudonymisation of the 150 data chunks generated by 16 students, 3 tutors and 3 decision makers. In the second phase of the project, this experience sparked questions about the meaning of such data handling and interpretations of Open Science, which led the researcher to suggest a framework for the professional development of qualitative researchers in their understanding of Open Science. The article raises awareness of normative frameworks in institutional data handling practices and calls for active contributions to defining qualitative research in an Open Science perspective, particularly taking as a reference the recent draft recommendation by UNESCO (2020)

AB This article provides an overview of the intersection of open data and public health by first defining open government data, public health data, and other key concepts and relevant terminologies. There are differing perceptions on the urgency and importance of the openness of public health data. It has been established that disease outbreaks such as happened during the Ebola and Zika virus epidemics are indicative of the need for countries to develop a framework that will provide guidance for the management of public health data. Such a framework should ensure that data collected during public health emergencies are accessible to the appropriate authorities and in a form that can help with timely decision-making during such public health crises. In this article, we highlight available open data policies across many countries, including in the Americas. Our analysis shows that there are currently no articulated policy guidelines for the collection and management of public health data across many countries, especially in Latin America. We propose that any national data governance strategy must address potential benefits, possible risks, examples of data that could be shared, and the attributes of such data. Finally, we stress that the key concern in the Americas should be the development of regional frameworks for open data in public health that can be adopted or adapted by each country through appropriate national or subnational policies and strategies.

AB This research aimed to create a linked open data (LOD) model using RDF (Resource Description Framework) for a legislative dataset from the House of Representatives. It has proceeded a literature review embracing the concepts of open data, open government data, linked data and linked open data followed by an applied research for a data modelling of legislative data in linked open data using RDF. The dataset "Deputies" was selected for this research. It covers information about political parties, state, e-mail, legislature among others, about the congressmen. It was observed that modelling the dataset using RDF is possible by reusing vocabularies and frameworks already established in Semantic Web e.g. Dublin Core, Friend of a Friend (FOAF), RDF and RDF Schema, together with correlated vocabularies like the Italian House of Representatives and the French National Assembly ontologies. As recommended by Linked Data best practices, the resources were also related to other LOD such as Geonames and DBpedia for semantic enhancement. The study allows us to conclude that making government data available, especially legislative data can be done according to the recommendations and best practices from W3C (World Wide Web Consortium). This practice integrates legislative data on the Web of Data and increase the possibilities of data reuse in transparency and oversight projects, which approaches citizens to the Congress and to their representatives.

AB An "open science movement" is gaining traction across many disciplines within the research enterprise but is also precipitating consternation among those who worry that too much disruption may be hampering professional productivity. Despite this disruption, proponents of open data collaboration have argued that some of the biggest problems of the 21st century need to be solved with the help of many people and that data sharing will be the necessary engine to make that happen. In the United States, a national strategic plan for data sharing encouraged the federally funded scientific agencies to (a) publish open data for community use in discoverable, machine-readable, and useful ways; (b) work with public and civil society organizations to set priorities for data to be shared; (c) support innovation and feedback on open data solutions; and (d) continue efforts to release and enhance high-priority data sets funded by taxpayer dollars. One of the more visible open data projects in the psychological sciences is the presidentially announced "Brain Research Through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies" (BRAIN) initiative. Lessons learned from initiatives such as these are instructive both from the perspective of open science within psychology and from the perspective of understanding the psychology of open science. Recommendations for creating better pathways to "walk the walk" in open science include (a) nurturing innovation and agile learning, (b) thinking outside the paradigm, (c) creating simplicity from complexity, and (d) participating in continuous learning evidence platforms.

AB Open science refers to an array of practices that promote openness, integrity, and reproducibility in research; the merits of which are being vigorously debated and developed across academic journals, listservs, conference sessions, and professional associations. The current paper identifies and clarifies major issues related to the use of open science practices (e.g., data sharing, study pre-registration, open access journals). We begin with a useful general description of what open science in organizational research represents and adopt a question-and-answer format. Through this format, we then focus on the application of specific open science practices and explore future directions of open science. All of this builds up to a series of specific actionable recommendations provided in conclusion, to help individual researchers, reviewers, journal editors, and other stakeholders develop a more open research environment and culture.

AB Open science practices are gaining momentum in psychophysiological research, but at the nascent stage of this special issue in the International Journal of Psychophysiology there was no systematic collection of resources to support the adoption of open science practices specific to studies of human electrophysiology (EEG). The purpose of this special issue was to gather and provide resources that identify the idiosyncratic considerations and implications of open science practices specifically for studies of human EEG and event-related potentials (ERPs). Papers also show the importance of promoting good scientific practices in the application of open science principles to EEG and ERPs. This introduction to the special issue provides a roadmap for identifying the resources necessary to begin and improve the application of open science principles to EEG and ERP research. We are optimistic that open science practices will help increase the robustness, rigor, and replicability of EEG/ERP research and ultimately become the norm in studies of EEG and ERPs.

AB Purpose Citizen Science - public participation in scientific projects - is becoming a global practice engaging volunteer participants, often non-scientists, with scientific research. Citizen Science is facing major challenges, such as quality and consistency, to reap open the full potential of its outputs and outcomes, including data, software and results. In this context, the principles put forth by Data Science and Open Science domains are essential for alleviating these challenges, which have been addressed at length in these domains. The purpose of this study is to explore the extent to which Citizen Science initiatives capitalise on Data Science and Open Science principles. Design/methodology/approach The authors analysed 48 Citizen Science projects related to pollution and its effects. They compared each project against a set of Data Science and Open Science indicators, exploring how each project defines, collects, analyses and exploits data to present results and contribute to knowledge. Findings The results indicate several shortcomings with respect to commonly accepted Data Science principles, including lack of a clear definition of research problems and limited description of data management and analysis processes, and Open Science principles, including lack of the necessary contextual information for reusing project outcomes. Originality/value In the light of this analysis, the authors provide a set of guidelines and recommendations for better adoption of Data Science and Open Science principles in Citizen Science projects, and introduce a software tool to support this adoption, with a focus on preparation of data management plans in Citizen Science projects.

ID INFORMATION-RETRIEVAL
AB Purpose Measuring the similarity between two resources is considered difficult due to a lack of reliable information and a wide variety of available information regarding the resources. Many approaches have been devised to tackle such difficulty. Although content-based approaches, which adopted resource-related data in comparing resources, played a major role in similarity measurement methodology, the lack of semantic insight on the data may leave these approaches imperfect. The purpose of this paper is to incorporate data semantics into the measuring process. Design/methodology/approach The emerged linked open data (LOD) provide a practical solution to tackle such difficulty. Common methodologies consuming LOD mainly focused on using link attributes that provide some sort of semantic relations between data. In this work, methods for measuring semantic distances between resources using information gathered from LOD were proposed. Such distances were then applied to music recommendation, focusing on the effect of various weight and level settings. Findings This work conducted experiments using the MusicBrainz dataset and evaluated the proposed schemes for the plausibility of LOD on music recommendation. The experimental result shows that the proposed methods electively improved classic approaches for both linked data semantic distance (LDSD) and PathSim methods by 47 and 9.7%, respectively. Originality/value The main contribution of this work is to develop novel schemes for incorporating knowledge from LOD. Two types of knowledge, namely attribute and path, were derived and incorporated into similarity measurements. Such knowledge may reflect the relationships between resources in a semantic manner since the links in LOD carry much semantic information regarding connecting resources.

AB Few dementia care interventions have been translated to healthcare contexts for those who need them. Embedded pragmatic clinical trials (ePCTs) are one design that can expedite the timeframe of research translation to clinical practice. As the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other funders commit immense new resources to increasing the nation's capacity to conduct dementia care ePCTs, we call on psychologists to employ their extensive expertise in open science to improve the quality of dementia care ePCTs. This article provides several recommendations to enhance the transparency and reporting rigor of ePCTs in dementia care and other chronic disease contexts. We illustrate these recommendations in the context of a recent pilot pragmatic trial known as the Porchlight Project. Porchlight provided training to volunteers who serve clients and caregivers to help them provide more "dementia capable" support. Notably this trial did not include a special effort to make use of open science practices. We discuss the benefits and costs had the Porchlight Project incorporated open science principles.

AB In this article, we provide a toolbox of recommendations and resources for those aspiring to promote the uptake of open scientific practices. Open Science encompasses a range of behaviours that aim to improve the transparency of scientific research. This paper is divided into seven sections, each devoted to different groups or institutions in the research ecosystem: colleagues, students, departments and faculties, universities, academic libraries, journals, and funders. We describe the behavioural influences and incentives for each of these stakeholders as well as changes they can make to foster Open Science. Our primary goal, however, is to suggest actions that researchers can take to promote these behaviours, inspired by simple principles of behaviour change: make it easy, social, and attractive. In isolation, a small shift in one person's behaviour may appear to make little difference, but when combined, many shifts can radically alter shared norms and culture. We offer this toolbox to assist individuals and institutions in cultivating a more open research culture.

AB Open data provide great potential for society, for example, in the field of smart cities, from which all citizens might profit. The trust of these citizens is important for the integration of various data, like sensitive user data, into an open data ecosystem. In the following study, we analyzed whether transparency about the application of open data promotes trust. Furthermore, we formulated guidelines on how to create transparency regarding open data in an ethical way. Using an open-data-based fictitious smart city app, we conducted an experiment analyzing to what extent communication of the technical open data application process and the ethical self-commitment for the transparent communication of data application affect trust in the app's provider. The results indicate that the more information users obtain regarding the use of open data, the more trustworthy they perceive the app provider to be, and the more likely they are to use the app.

ID INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE; REGISTRATION
AB We conducted an audit of 60 clinical psychology journals, covering the first 2 quartiles by impact factor on Web of Science. We evaluated editorial policies in 5 domains crucial to reproducibility and transparency (prospective registration, data sharing, preprints, endorsement of reporting guidelines and conflict of interest [COI] disclosure). We examined implementation in a randomly selected cross-sectional sample of 201 articles published in 2017 in the "best practice" journals, defined as having explicit supportive policies in 4 out of 5 domains. Our findings showed that 15 journals cited prospective registration. 40 data sharing, 15 explicitly permitted preprints, 28 endorsed reporting guidelines, and 52 had mandatory policies for COI disclosure. Except for COI disclosure, few policies were mandatory: registration in 15 journals, data sharing in 1, and reporting guidelines for randomized trials in 18 and for meta-analyses in 15. Seventeen journals were identified as "best practice." An analysis of recent articles showed extremely low compliance for prospective registration (3% articles) and data sharing (2%). One preprint could be identified. Reporting guidelines were endorsed in 19% of the articles, though for most articles this domain was rated as nonapplicable. Only half of the articles included a COI disclosure. Desired open science policies should become clear and mandatory. and their enforcement streamlined by reducing the multiplicity of guidelines and templates.

ID MODELS; IMPACT
AB Purpose Popular contingency approaches to organisational change management imply that it is known what and when practices are most appropriate and effective to manage change. The current work aims to question this assumption. Design/methodology/approach The current work critically reviews the quality of current evidence supporting organisational change management and considers the role of open science practices for the field. Findings First, evidence informing organisational change management is poor, heavily reliant upon unquestioned theoretical models and low-quality cross-sectional or case-study designs. Greater adoption of an evidence-based approach to practice could facilitate organisational change management, but only once a higher quality of evidence is available to inform more robust practical guidance. Second, open science practices look well placed to drive a higher quality of evidence suitable for informing future change management. Originality/value The current work highlights the problematic nature of the quality and application of current evidence to inform organisational change and raises a number of recommendations to support future evidence development using an open science approach.

ID KNOWLEDGE
AB The open science (OS) movement has garnered increasing support in academia alongside continued financial and reputational incentives to obtain intellectual property (IP) protections over research outputs. Here, we explore stakeholder perspectives about intersections between OS and IP to inform the development of institutional OS guidelines for the neurosciences in Canada. We held six focus groups and three interviews with 29 faculty members from a major research and clinical center in Canada. The semi-structured interview guide probed perspectives on the respective roles of patents and OS in neuroscience-related research. We applied thematic content analysis to the transcript data, and extracted 12 major themes and 30 subthemes. Participants perceived a conflict between OS ideologies and the inherently restrictive nature of patents, and highlighted the importance of autonomy, justice, and respectful, culturally safe research practices in any future adoption of OS. Overall, the data suggest that a hybrid OS-IP policy model supported by local expertise may be best suited to meet the priorities and values of the community while mitigating perceived threats. This model includes expanded education about patenting, incentivized data sharing and collaboration, and tangible resources to support implementation of OS that includes skilled support in digital research infrastructures.

AB Feeding a growing global population requires improving agricultural production in the face of multidimensional challenges; and digital agriculture is increasingly seen as a strategy for better decision making. Agriculture and agricultural supply chains are increasingly reliant on data, including its access and provision from the farm to the consumer. Far-reaching data provision inevitably needs the adoption of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) that offer data originators and depository custodians with a set of guidelines to safeguard a progressive data availability and reusability. Through a systematic literature review it is apparent that although FAIR data principles can play a key role in achieving sustainable agricultural operational and business performance, there are few published studies on how they have been adopted and used. The investigation examines: (1) how FAIR data assimilate with the sustainability framework; and (2) whether the use of FAIR data by the agriculture industry, has an impact on agricultural performance. The work identifies a social science research gap and suggests a method to guide agriculture practitioners in identifying the specific barriers in making their data FAIR. By troubleshooting the barriers, the value propositions of adopting FAIR data in agriculture can be better understood and addressed.

AB Open Science policies encourage researchers to disclose a wide range of outputs from their work, thus codifying openness as a specific set of research practices and guidelines that can be interpreted and applied consistently across disciplines and geographical settings. In this paper, we argue that this "one-size-fits-all" view of openness sidesteps key questions about the forms, implications, and goals of openness for research practice. We propose instead to interpret openness as a dynamic and highly situated mode of valuing the research process and its outputs, which encompasses economic as well as scientific, cultural, political, ethical, and social considerations. This interpretation creates a critical space for moving beyond the economic definitions of value embedded in the contemporary biosciences landscape and Open Science policies, and examining the diversity of interests and commitments that affect research practices in the life sciences. To illustrate these claims, we use three case studies that highlight the challenges surrounding decisions about how-and how best-to make things open. These cases, drawn from ethnographic engagement with Open Science debates and semistructured interviews carried out with UK-based biologists and bioinformaticians between 2013 and 2014, show how the enactment of openness reveals judgments about what constitutes a legitimate intellectual contribution, for whom, and with what implications.

AB Open science advocates argue that making data sets, studies, methodologies, and other aspects of research free from publication fees and available to scholars will increase collaborations, access, and dissemination of knowledge. In this article, I argue that open access policies and practices raise both feminist and ethical issues. I reflect on the five themes of feminist ethics identified 20 years ago by a task force of the Society for the Psychology of Women. I update the themes with recent scholarship of feminist philosophers and ethicists, and I use the themes to raise questions about the promises and challenges of open access. Throughout, I offer suggestions for all who seek to make knowledge of human psychology more complete and more accessible to more people. I conclude by offering recommendations informed by feminist ethics to those building the policies and practices of open access.

AB This article explores different perspectives attributed to the open data initiatives and how these perspectives shape the opening-up process. A socio-technical lens, the social construction of technology, was used to analyse a qualitative cross-case study of two Swedish municipalities. Findings revealed two ways of interpreting open data initiatives: 1) as a platform for techno-economic growth and 2) as a platform for co-created societal growth. These two approaches addressed the municipalities respective contextual challenges and interests alongside national recommendations in their aims to realize the open data initiative. In doing so, they diverged into the evolvement toward two different ends: the realization of open data and the realization of open government. To excel the understanding of actions taken to meet these ends, an additional set of differences between these municipalities is provided within a sociotechnical framework that allows us to discuss diverging evolvements of open data initiatives based on agreed and non-agreed interpretations of what is believed to be constructed.

AB The article describes a position statement and recommendations for actions that need to be taken to develop best practices for promoting scientific integrity through open science in health psychology endorsed at a Synergy Expert Group Meeting. Sixteen Synergy Meeting participants developed a set of recommendations for researchers, gatekeepers, and research end-users. The group process followed a nominal group technique and voting system to elicit and decide on the most relevant and topical issues. Seventeen priority areas were listed and voted on, 15 of them were recommended by the group. Specifically, the following priority actions for health psychology were endorsed: (1) for researchers: advancing when and how to make data open and accessible at various research stages and understanding researchers' beliefs and attitudes regarding open data; (2) for educators: integrating open science in research curricula, e.g., through online open science training modules, promoting preregistration, transparent reporting, open data and applying open science as a learning tool; (3) for journal editors: providing an open science statement, and open data policies, including a minimal requirements submission checklist. Health psychology societies and journal editors should collaborate in order to develop a coordinated plan for research integrity and open science promotion across behavioural disciplines.

AB As an emerging agenda in science and public policy discourse, the open science (OS) movement has affected university-industry research collaboration (UIRC) including normative changes concerning actors' value and belief systems. Thus, the following questions have become pertinent: what are the norms and beliefs of key actors engaged in UIRC regarding OS practices? How have the norms and beliefs led to tensions in UIRC and dynamics facilitating or impeding OS? This study explores these questions through two case studies by applying institutional logics theory as an analytical lens. Through analysing case studies concerning UIRC in Finland, a pioneer in the global OS movement, six institutional logics that are either pro- or contra-OS practices were identified: the state, market, corporation, profession, traditional trust-based community and sustainability-based community logics. The strongest tensions are between the state and market logics and between the profession and market logics. In the end of the study, recommendations are solicited for OS policymakers and practitioners based on the research findings.

AB Participatory mapping emerged from a need for more inclusive methods of collecting spatial data with the intention of democratizing the decision-making process. It encompasses a range of methods including mental mapping, sketch mapping, and participatory geographic information systems. There has been a rapid increase in uptake of participatory mapping, but the multidisciplinary nature of the field has resulted in a lack of consistency in the conducting and reporting of research, limiting further development. In this article, we argue that an open science approach is required to enable the field to advance, increasing transparency and replicability in how participatory mapping research is both conducted and reported. This argument is supported by the first large-scale systematic review of the field, which identifies specific areas within participatory mapping that would benefit from an open science approach. Four questions are used to explore the sample: (1) How are different participatory mapping methods being used and reported? (2) What information is given on the data collected through participatory mapping? (3) How are participant demographics being recorded? (4) Who is conducting the research, and where is it being published? From a total of 578 academic research articles, we analyzed a stratified sample of 117. The review reveals a significant lack of reporting on key details in the data collection process, restricting the transparency, replicability, and transferability of participatory mapping research and demonstrating the urgent need for an open science approach. Recommendations are then drawn from the results to guide the design of future participatory mapping research.

AB Scientific evidence should guide the selection of practice for individuals with disabilities. Scientific evidence, however, must be trustworthy to move special education toward greater empirical certainty and more effective policies and practices. Transparency, openness, and reproducibility increase the trustworthiness of evidence. We propose that researchers in special education adopt emerging open-science reforms, such as preprints, data and materials sharing, preregistration of studies and analysis plans, and Registered Reports. Adoption of these practices will require shifts in cultural norms, guidelines, and incentives. We discuss how adopting open-science practices can advance the quality of research and, consequently, policy and practice in special education.

AB Open-science reforms, which aim to increase credibility and access of research, have the potential to benefit the research base in special education, as well as practice and policy informed by that research base. Awareness of open science is increasing among special education researchers. However, relatively few researchers in the field have experience using multiple open-science practices, and few practical guidelines or resources have been tailored to special education researchers to support their exploration and adoption of open science. In this article, we described and provided guidelines and resources for applying five core open-science practices-preregistration, registered reports, data sharing, materials sharing, and open-access publishing-in special education research.

AB Thanks to the recent spread of the Linked Open Data (LOD) initiative, a huge amount of machine-readable knowledge encoded as RDF statements is today available in the so-called LOD cloud. Accordingly, a big effort is now spent to investigate to what extent such information can be exploited to develop new knowledge-based services or to improve the effectiveness of knowledge-intensive platforms as Recommender Systems (RS).
   To this end, in this article we study the impact of the exogenous knowledge coming from the LOD cloud on the overall performance of a graph-based recommendation framework. Specifically, we propose a methodology to automatically feed a graph-based RS with features gathered from the LOD cloud and we analyze the impact of several widespread feature selection techniques in such recommendation settings.
   The experimental evaluation, performed on three state-of-the-art datasets, provided several outcomes: first, information extracted from the LOD cloud can significantly improve the performance of a graph-based RS. Next, experiments showed a clear correlation between the choice of the feature selection technique and the ability of the algorithm to maximize specific evaluation metrics, as accuracy or diversity of the recommendations. Moreover, our graph-based algorithm fed with LOD-based features was able to overcome several baselines, as collaborative filtering and matrix factorization. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this article we propose a framework that generates natural language explanations supporting the suggestions generated by a recommendation algorithm.
   The cornerstone of our approach is the usage of Linked Open Data (LOD) for explanation aims. Indeed, the descriptive properties freely available in the LOD cloud (e.g., the author of a book or the director of a movie) can be used to build a graph that connects the recommendations the user received to the items she previously liked via the properties extracted from the LOD cloud. In a nutshell, our approach is based on the insight that properties describing the items the user previously liked as well as the suggestions she received can be effectively used to explain the recommendations.
   Such a framework is both algorithm-independent and domain-independent, thus it can generate a natural language explanation for every kind of recommendation algorithm, and it can be used to explain a single recommendation (Top-1 scenario) as well as a group of recommendations (Top-N scenario). It is worth noting that the algorithm-independent characteristic does not mean that the framework is able to explain to the user how the recommendations have been generated and how the recommendation algorithm works. The framework explains to users why they might like the recommended items, independently from the recommendation algorithm that generated the recommendations.
   In the experimental evaluation, we carried out a user study (N = 680) aiming to investigate the effectiveness of our framework in three different domains, as movies, books and music. Results showed that our technique leads to transparent explanations for all the domains, and such explanations resulted independent of the specific recommendation algorithm in most of the experimental settings. Moreover, we also showed the goodness of our strategy when an entire group of recommendations has to be explained.
   As a case study, we integrated the framework in a real-world application, a conversational recommender system implemented as a Telegram Bot. The idea is to use the explanation for supporting both the training phase (when the user expresses her preferences) and the recommendation step (when the user receives the recommendations). Interesting outcomes emerge from these preliminary experiments. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID REPORTING QUALITATIVE RESEARCH; GUIDELINES
AB As the field of education, and especially gifted education, gradually moves toward open science, our research community increasingly values transparency and openness brought by open science practices. Yet, individual researchers may be reluctant to adopt open science practices due to low incentives, barriers of extra workload, or lack of support to apply these in certain areas, such as qualitative research. We encourage and give guidelines to reviewers to champion open science practices by warmly influencing authors to consider applying open science practices to quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-methods research and providing ample support to produce higher-quality publications. Instead of imposing open science practices on authors, we advocate reviewers suggest small, non-threatening, specific steps to support authors without making them feel overwhelmed, judged, or punished. We believe that these small steps taken by reviewers will make a difference to create a more supportive environment for researchers to adopt more open science practices.

AB In developing open data policies, governments aim to stimulate and guide the publication of government data and to gain advantages from its use. Currently there is a multiplicity of open data policies at various levels of government, whereas very little systematic and structured research has been done on the issues that are covered by open data policies, their intent and actual impact. Furthermore, no suitable framework for comparing open data policies is available, as open data is a recent phenomenon and is thus in an early stage of development. In order to help bring about a better understanding of the common and differentiating elements in the policies and to identify the factors affecting the variation in policies, this paper develops a framework for comparing open data policies. The framework includes the factors of environment and context, policy content, performance indicators and public values. Using this framework, seven Dutch governmental policies at different government levels are compared. The comparison shows both similarities and differences among open data policies, providing opportunities to learn from each other's policies. The findings suggest that current policies are rather inward looking, open data policies can be improved by collaborating with other organizations, focusing on the impact of the policy, stimulating the use of open data and looking at the need to create a culture in which publicizing data is incorporated in daily working processes. The findings could contribute to the development of new open data policies and the improvement of existing open data policies. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB The ever-increasing journal subscriptions have seen many universities and research institutions failing to provide access to the much-needed scholarship for propagation of research and development due to dwindling budget allocations. Hence, the adoption of open access (OA) institutional repositories (IR) by the institutions to increase access, availability and visibility of their research output to a wider readership. Institutional repository (IR) technologies have transformed the traditional academic library practice, thus upsetting the work culture of librarians. Though studies there have been studies on the impact of IRs on academic librarians elsewhere in the world, none have been done on the Zimbabwean context. This study draws from a wider study which explored utilisation of institutional repositories in Zimbabwe's public universities. The study sought to answer the question: What is the role of the academic librarian in promoting the institutional repository? The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of technology (UTAUT) informed the study, while a mixed methods approach was employed using document analysis, questionnaires and interviews to collect data from librarians in eight public universities. Findings revealed that in some instances IR responsibilities were added to existing duties for incumbent staff while in others, staff were reassigned to IR roles resulting in diverse staff categories maintaining the IRs across the universities. Recommendations for effective and efficient management of the repositories by the universities are made. The study is relevant to other academic libraries in developing countries and Africa particularly countries whose economies are crumbling.

AB Despite increasing calls to build equitable data infrastructures, the education field has yet to have a shared guideline around equitable education data management and stewardship. To address this gap, we propose one framework from the data governance literature: the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data management principles complemented by the CARE (Collective benefits, Authority to control, Responsibility, Ethics) principles. We argue that making education data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) is a matter of equity and central to equity-focused data reuse. We illustrate the importance of FAIR education data by synthesizing our research experience and literature at the intersection of data governance and equity-focused data use.

AB Government agencies collect large amounts of structured and unstructured data. Although these data can be used to improve services as well as policy processes, it is not always clear how to analyze the data and how to glean insights for policy making, especially when the data includes large volumes of unstructured text data. This article reports opinions found in "We the People" petition data using topic modeling and visual analytics. It provides an assessment of the usability of the visual analytics results for policy making based on interviews with data professionals and policy makers. We found that visual analytics have potentially positive impacts on policy making practices. Experts also articulated potential barriers regarding the adoption of visual analytics tools, and made suggestions. Potential barriers included insufficient resources in government agencies and difficulty integrating analytics with current work practices. The main suggestions involved providing training and interpretation guidelines along with the visual analytics tools. Major contributions of this study include: (1) suggesting viable visualization tools for analyzing textual data for policy making, and (2) suggesting how to lower barriers to adoption by increasing usability.

ID PERSPECTIVE; ADOPTION; PORTALS; IMPACT
AB U.S. cities, among the vanguards of open data globally, are investing in renewed efforts to support Open Government with the creation of open data portals that are used to provide machine-readable administratively collected data sets. Transparency of the public sector is still widely seen as the main outcome of these efforts. Such a simplistic view, however, misses the rich variety of innovations resulting from open data use. We conceptualize these innovation outcomes across two dimensions: internal/external and product/process. Interviews with 15 city managers in the U.S. who are responsible for the implementation of open data policies were conducted to compare policy intentions, perceived innovation outcomes as well as actual ones. The findings show that product-centric outcomes are predominant and relate mainly to external innovation, including applications, websites and new services. Process-centric outcomes constitute rather internal innovation, such as procedural changes and the revival of innovation culture in government. We close with a set of recommendations for open data efforts in government that include structural, procedural, as well as cultural changes for successful open data initiatives.

ID TRIALS; IMPLEMENTATION; PARTNERSHIPS; PROTOCOL; DESIGNS
AB Preventing adverse health outcomes is complex due to the multi-level contexts and social systems in which these phenomena occur. To capture both the systemic effects, local determinants, and individual-level risks and protective factors simultaneously, the prevention field has called for adoption of system science methods in general and agent-based models (ABMs) specifically. While these models can provide unique and timely insight into the potential of prevention strategies, an ABM's ability to do so depends strongly on its accuracy in capturing the phenomenon. Furthermore, for ABMs to be useful, they need to be accepted by and available to decision-makers and other stakeholders. These two attributes of accuracy and acceptability are key components of open science. To ensure the creation of high-fidelity models and reliability in their outcomes and consequent model-based decision-making, we present a set of recommendations for adopting and using this novel method. We recommend ways to include stakeholders throughout the modeling process, as well as ways to conduct model verification, validation, and replication. Examples from HIV and overdose prevention work illustrate how these recommendations can be applied.

AB Public administrations publish open data for later reuse by citizens. Besides the obvious impact on transparency, they have an important economic potential which explains the increasing adoption of this type of initiatives. There is an increasing number of administrations that decide to create open data portals, a tendency that municipalities have followed. Few empirical papers have assessed this type of portals and the analyses have been mainly qualitative or limited to a reduced number of portals, so there are no generally accepted criteria for the assessment of their implementation. The main contribution of this paper is the definition of a method to analyse open data portals and its application to a sample of municipalities of Spain, a country at the forefront of data re-utilization in Europe. Furthermore, the economic-financial information available in these portals is analysed, as it is essential to accountability, fight corruption and evaluate the financial sustainability and effectiveness of public service delivery. Results show that there is much room for improvement in this field. Only 40% of the cities analysed have an open data portal, and the average score of the sample analysed does not reach 50%. Most portals seem to work as mere data repositories, neglecting those aspects that promote data use by the non-expert public, accountability, citizen engagement and the quality of the data being disclosed (e.g., definition of the metadata used). So, the paper concludes with some recommendations for improvement.

AB Transparency in the public sector is one of the most important topics of the current debates on accountable, participatory, and responsive governance. An open government addresses these major topics and aims to encourage the relationships and flows of information between involved stakeholders. This article explores the role of open data portals in supporting these efforts and provides findings regarding the features in the design of these data infrastructures. On the basis of evidence from the concept of transparency-by-design, we argue that transparency is facilitated by open data portals and their features enabling to work with datasets. We therefore propose the list of the categories and corresponding features of open data portals that should constitute the checklist of the portal aiming to achieve the highest level of transparency. The mapping of existing features found in literature to the phases of the transparency cycle demonstrates that open data portals meet the transparency requirements.

ID QUALITY
AB In this article, based on data collected through interviews and a workshop, the benefits and adoption barriers for open data have been derived. The results suggest that a conceptually simplistic view is often adopted with regard to open data, which automatically correlates the publicizing of data with use and benefits. Also, five "myths" concerning open data are presented, which place the expectations within a realistic perspective. Further, the recommendation is provided that such projects should take a user's view.

AB Open and transparent practices in scholarly research are increasingly encouraged by academic journals and funding agencies. Various elements of behavior analytic research are communicated transparently, though it is not common practice to archive study materials to support future replications. This tutorial presents a review of the Transparent and Open Practices guidelines provided by the Open Science Foundation and provides instructions on how behavior analysts can use GitHub transparency in research across multiple levels. GitHub is presented as a service that can be used to publicly archive various elements of research and is uniquely suited to research that is technical, data driven, and collaborative. The GitHub platform is reviewed, and the steps necessary to create an account, initialize repositories, archive study files, and synchronize changes to remote repositories are described in several examples. Implications of increased calls for transparency and modern statistical methods are discussed with regard to behavior analysis, and archiving platforms such as GitHub are reviewed as one means of supporting transparent research.

ID CHALLENGES
AB The open science (OS) movement has advocated for increased transparency in certain aspects of research. Communication is taking its first steps toward OS as some journals have adopted OS guidelines codified by another discipline. We find this pursuit troubling as OS prioritizes openness while insufficiently addressing essential ethical principles: respect for persons, beneficence, and justice. Some recommended open science practices increase the potential for harm for marginalized participants, communities, and researchers. We elaborate how OS can serve a marginalizing force within academia and the research community, as it overlooks the needs of marginalized scholars and excludes some forms of scholarship. We challenge the current instantiation of OS and propose a divergent agenda for the future of Communication research centered on ethical, inclusive research practices.

ID MODEL
AB The diffusion of Open Government Data (OGD) in recent years kept a very fast pace. However, evidence from practitioners shows that disclosing data without proper quality control may jeopardize dataset reuse and negatively affect civic participation. Current approaches to the problem in literature lack a comprehensive theoretical framework. Moreover, most of the evaluations concentrate on open data platforms, rather than on datasets. In this work, we address these two limitations and set up a framework of indicators to measure the quality of Open Government Data on a series of data quality dimensions at most granular level of measurement. We validated the evaluation framework by applying it to compare two cases of Italian OGD datasets: an internationally recognized good example of OGD, with centralized disclosure and extensive data quality controls, and samples of OGD from decentralized data disclosure (municipality level), with no possibility of extensive quality controls as in the former case, hence with supposed lower quality.
   Starting from measurements based on the quality framework, we were able to verify the difference in quality: the measures showed a few common acquired good practices and weaknesses, and a set of discriminating factors that pertain to the type of datasets and the overall approach. On the basis of this evaluation, we also provided technical and policy guidelines to overcome the weaknesses observed in the decentralized release policy, addressing specific quality aspects.

AB PurposeScience policy and practice for open access (OA) books is a rapidly evolving area in the scholarly domain. However, there is much that remains unknown, including how many OA books there are and to what degree they are included in preservation coverage. The purpose of this study is to contribute towards filling this knowledge gap in order to advance both research and practice in the domain of OA books.Design/methodology/approachThis study utilized open bibliometric data sources to aggregate a harmonized dataset of metadata records for OA books (data sources: the Directory of Open Access Books, OpenAIRE, OpenAlex, Scielo Books, The Lens, and WorldCat). This dataset was then cross-matched based on unique identifiers and book titles to openly available content listings of trusted preservation services (data sources: Cariniana Network, CLOCKSS, Global LOCKSS Network, and Portico). The web domains of the OA books were determined by querying the web addresses or digital object identifiers provided in the metadata of the bibliometric database entries.FindingsIn total, 396,995 unique records were identified from the OA book bibliometric sources, of which 19% were found to be included in at least one of the preservation services. The results suggest reason for concern for the long tail of OA books distributed at thousands of different web domains as these include volatile cloud storage or sometimes no longer contained the files at all.Research limitations/implicationsData quality issues, varying definitions of OA across services and inconsistent implementation of unique identifiers were discovered as key challenges. The study includes recommendations for publishers, libraries, data providers and preservation services for improving monitoring and practices for OA book preservation.Originality/valueThis study provides methodological and empirical findings for advancing the practices of OA book publishing, preservation and research.

AB Ongoing technological developments have made it easier than ever before for scientists to share their data, materials, and analysis code. Sharing data and analysis code makes it easier for other researchers to reuse or check published research. However, these benefits will emerge only if researchers can reproduce the analyses reported in published articles and if data are annotated well enough so that it is clear what all variable and value labels mean. Because most researchers are not trained in computational reproducibility, it is important to evaluate current practices to identify those that can be improved. We examined data and code sharing for Registered Reports published in the psychological literature from 2014 to 2018 and attempted to independently computationally reproduce the main results in each article. Of the 62 articles that met our inclusion criteria, 41 had data available, and 37 had analysis scripts available. Both data and code for 36 of the articles were shared. We could run the scripts for 31 analyses, and we reproduced the main results for 21 articles. Although the percentage of articles for which both data and code were shared (36 out of 62, or 58%) and the percentage of articles for which main results could be computationally reproduced (21 out of 36, or 58%) were relatively high compared with the percentages found in other studies, there is clear room for improvement. We provide practical recommendations based on our observations and cite examples of good research practices in the studies whose main results we reproduced.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB The COVID-19 pandemic has shone a light on the complex relationship between science and policy. Policymakers have had to make decisions at speed in conditions of uncertainty, implementing policies that have had profound consequences for people's lives. Yet this process has sometimes been characterised by fragmentation, opacity and a disconnect between evidence and policy. In the United Kingdom, concerns about the secrecy that initially surrounded this process led to the creation of Independent SAGE, an unofficial group of scientists from different disciplines that came together to ask policy-relevant questions, review the evolving evidence, and make evidence-based recommendations. The group took a public health approach with a population perspective, worked in a holistic transdisciplinary way, and were committed to public engagement. In this paper, we review the lessons learned during its first year. These include the importance of learning from local expertise, the value of learning from other countries, the role of civil society as a critical friend to government, finding appropriate relationships between science and policy, and recognising the necessity of viewing issues through an equity lens.

AB Universities have been pressured by governments to change their way of acting and to be more responsible with the requirements of social development to face the challenges of globalization. To this end, universities must use the principles of Open Science, to allow them to be more transparent regarding the dissemination of scientific results. The purpose of this paper is firstly, to determine the progress made in Open Access policies made by the best-ranked universities regarding ARWU. Secondly, to examine influencing factors that enhance the level of openness in researching, in particular, "transparency", "reputation", "participation", "funding", "foundation" and "size". The main results show that those private and older universities, best-ranked in terms of excellence researching and those that have been gradually adopting Open Government policies concerning the dissemination of information through institutional web pages and social participation, are the most interested with complying the recommendations established by the authorities of the Open Science projects.

AB The present review is the result of a one-day workshop on open science, held at the Annual Meeting of the Society for Psychophysiological Research in Washington, DC, September 2019. The contributors represent psychophysiological researchers at different career stages and from a wide spectrum of institutions. The state of open science in psychophysiology is discussed from different perspectives, highlighting key challenges, potential benefits, and emerging solutions that are intended to facilitate open science practices. Three domains are emphasized: data sharing, preregistration, and multi-site studies. In the context of these broader domains, we present potential implementations of specific open science procedures such as data format harmonization, power analysis, data, presentation code and analysis pipeline sharing, suitable for psychophysiological research. Practical steps are discussed that may be taken to facilitate the adoption of open science practices in psychophysiology. These steps include (1) promoting broad and accessible training in the skills needed to implement open science practices, such as collaborative research and computational reproducibility initiatives, (2) establishing mechanisms that provide practical assistance in sharing of processing pipelines, presentation code, and data in an efficient way, and (3) improving the incentive structure for open science approaches. Throughout the manuscript, we provide references and links to available resources for those interested in adopting open science practices in their research.

AB Citizen science programs offer opportunities for K-12 students to engage in authentic science inquiry. However, these programs often fall short of including learners as agents in the entire process, and thus contrast with the growing open science movement within scientific communities. Notably, study ideation and peer review, which are central to the making of science, are typically reserved for professional scientists. This study describes the implementation of an open science curriculum that engages high school students in a full cycle of scientific inquiry. We explored the focus and quality of students' study designs and peer reviews, and their perceptions of open science based on their participation in the program. Specifically, we implemented a human brain and behavior citizen science unit in 6 classrooms across 3 high schools. After learning about open science and citizen science, students (N = 104) participated in scientist-initiated research studies, and then collaboratively proposed their own studies to investigate personally interesting questions about human behavior and the brain. Students then peer reviewed proposals of students from other schools. Based on a qualitative and quantitative analysis of students' artifacts created in-unit and on a pre and posttest, we describe their interests, abilities, and self-reported experiences with study design and peer review. Our findings suggest that participation in open science in a human brain and behavior research context can engage students with critical aspects of experiment design, as well as with issues that are unique to human subjects research, such as research ethics. Meanwhile, the quality of students' study designs and reviews changed in notable, but mixed, ways: While students improved in justifying the importance of research studies, they did not improve in their abilities to align methods to their research questions. In terms of peer review, students generally reported that their peers' feedback was helpful, but our analysis showed that student reviewers struggled to articulate concrete recommendations for improvement. In light of these findings, we discuss the need for curricula that support the development of research and review abilities by building on students' interests, while also guiding students in transferring these abilities across a range of research foci.

DT Article
AB Privacy and confidentiality are core considerations in education, while at the same time, using and sharing data-and, more broadly, open science-is increasingly valued by editors, funding agencies, and the public. This manuscript responds to an empirical investigation of students' perceptions of the use of their data in learning analytics systems by Ifentahler and Schumacher (Educational Technology Research and Development, 64: 923-938, 2016). We summarize their work in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting shift to digital modes of teaching and learning by many teachers, using the tension between privacy and open science to frame our response. We offer informed recommendations for educational technology researchers in light of Ifentahler and Schumacher's findings as well as strategies for navigating the tension between these important values. We conclude with a call for educational technology scholars to meet the challenge of studying learning (and disruptions to learning) in light of COVID-19 while protecting the privacy of students in ways that go beyond what Institutional Review Boards consider to be within their purview.

AB This paper aims to provide a broad perspective on the development of benchmarking open data efforts through indices and rankings over the years, both at the level of countries and allowing for a cross-country comparison. The methodology follows a systematic search for the relevant resources, their classification and identification of six open data benchmarks to be further analyzed, the identification of their key components through decomposition, their description, and identifying the similarities and differences. Three major groups of indices and four periods that characterize the efforts to benchmark and measure the development of open data are identified, where the first measure the openness of the selected categories of data, the second focuses on different aspects of the open data ecosystem, using a large number of variables, and the third is a combination of both approaches. Recommendations as well as trends that can form the benchmarking frameworks in the future are also discussed. The findings are of a high importance for individual countries, which allow for correct and accurate interpretation of the results changes in the scope of a given index or rank, i.e., whether the difference in results is the result of national efforts or the subject of changes in the specific index, as well as how to combine and interpret the results of a number of indices for correct decision-making and for the definition of the future actions where the results vary significantly. In addition, the findings are also important for international organizations publishing benchmarking reports.

AB With social media data widely available, researchers are increasingly incorporating tweets, posts, and blogs in their work. While easily accessible, the use of "public" posts raises important questions about the ethics of mining, storing, analyzing, and reporting publicly available social media data-especially when gathering sensitive information such as sexual violence disclosures. Online movements including #MeToo and #WhyIDidntReport emerged to shed light on gender-based violence. These movements generate large quantities of data with little consistency and oversight across research groups, disciplines, and review boards on data ethics. With the recent push in social science to publish data to open science databases, the concerns of feminist psychologists and ethical concerns of social media research with survivors have become more salient. In this article, we describe and address these ethical issues by reviewing existing social media sexual assault disclosure research and make concrete recommendations for authors seeking to use social media data. We also seek to address these ethical concerns by noting the work of some feminist researchers, but also by pushing researchers to do more for survivors through a survivor-informed approach to this research in an open science context. We propose four survivor-informed recommendations for research with this vulnerable population: (a) get input from survivors, (b) update ethics review boards, (c) maximize benefits to participants, and (d) utilize study-appropriate datasets with informed consent.

AB Problem, research strategy, and findings: In this study, we investigate how to exploit big and open data (BOD) to quantitatively examine the relationships between transit-oriented development (TOD) attributes and TOD outcomes. Here, TOD attributes are measurable or perceivable attributes that TOD proponents cherish, and TOD outcomes are the targeted outcomes, such as increased ridership, associated at least partially with TOD attributes. Based on BOD from Shenzhen (China), we create indicators to measure both TOD attributes and outcomes. We explore the associations of TOD attributes, including centrality of a TOD site, travel time to the central business district, density, destination, diversity, and design, with TOD outcomes. We identify the TOD attribute that best predicts TOD outcomes such as metro ridership, frequent riders, people co-located in a station area, and ratios derived from these outcomes. We find that special neighborhoods, specific metro lines, and age of the district significantly influence TOD outcomes. Our study has a few limitations: a) the BOD we use do not directly measure TOD attributes, so proxies must be used; and b) the BOD we use contain little information about "why," "who," and "how," such as why people rode transit, who they were, and how they perceived/appreciated various TOD attributes. Takeway for practice: BOD-derived variables allow planners to revalidate existing planning guidelines and principles concerning TOD and adapt them to local contexts. BOD can also be used to formulate new metrics to evaluate different TOD plans or projects in ways not achievable with traditional data alone. In short, BOD can and should be used to refine TOD analytics and design and to implement corresponding theories in pursuit of TOD.

AB Objective : There is increasing consensus that open science practices improve the transparency and quality of clinical science. However, several barriers impede the implementation of these practices at the individual, institutional, and field levels; understanding and addressing these barriers is critical to promoting targeted efforts in increasing effective uptake of open science.Methods : Within this research forum, we drew from publicly available online information sources to identify initial characterizations of researchers engaged in several types of open science practices in the field of eating disorders. We use these observations to discuss potential barriers and recommendations for next steps in the promotion of these practices.Results : Data from online open science repositories suggest that individuals using these publishing approaches with pre-prints and articles with eating-disorder-relevant content are predominantly non-male gender identifying, early to mid-career stage, and are more likely to be European-, United States-, or Canada-based.Discussion : We outline recommendations for tangible ways that the eating disorder field can support broad, increased uptake of open science practices, including supporting initiatives to increase knowledge and correct misconceptions; and prioritizing the development and accessibility of open science resources.Public Significance Statement : The use of open science practices has the potential to increase the transparency and quality of clinical science. This Forum uses publicly sourced online data to characterize researchers engaged in open science practices in the field of eating disorders. These observations provide an important framework from which to discuss potential barriers to open science and recommendations for next steps in the promotion of these practices.

DE Quality; Open data; Open government data; Completeness; Formats
AB Purpose The use of open data can help the public find value in various areas of interests. Many governments have created and published a huge amount of open data; however, people have a hard time using open data because of data quality issues. The UK, the USA and Korea have created and published open data; however, the rate of open data implementation and level of open data impact is very low because of data quality issues like incompatible data formats and incomplete data. This study aims to compare the statuses of data quality from open government sites in the UK, the USA and Korea and also present guidelines for publishing data format and enhancing data completeness.
   Design/methodology/approach This study uses statistical analysis of different data formats and examination of data completeness to explore key issues of data quality in open government data.
   Findings Findings show that the USA and the UK have published more than 50 per cent of open data in level one. Korea has published 52.8 per cent of data in level three. Level one data are not machine-readable; therefore, users have a hard time using them. The level one data are found in portable document format and hyper text markup language (HTML) and are locked up in documents; therefore, machines cannot extract out the data. Findings show that incomplete data are existing in all three governments' open data.
   Originality/value Governments should investigate data incompleteness of all open data and correct incomplete data of the most used data. Governments can find the most used data easily by monitoring data sets that have been downloaded most frequently over a certain period.

AB Historically, science of science (Sci2) studies have been performed by single investigators or small teams. As the size and complexity of data sets and analyses scales up, a "Big Science'' approach (Price, Little science, big science, 1963) is required that exploits the expertise and resources of interdisciplinary teams spanning academic, government, and industry boundaries. Big Sci2 studies utilize "big data'', i.e., large, complex, diverse, longitudinal, and/or distributed datasets that might be owned by different stake-holders. They apply a systems science approach to uncover hidden patterns, bursts of activity, correlations, and laws. They make available open data and open code in support of replication of results, iterative refinement of approaches and tools, and education. This paper introduces a database-tool infrastructure that was designed to support big Sci2 studies. The open access Scholarly Database (http://sdb.cns.iu.edu) provides easy access to 26 million paper, patent, grant, and clinical trial records. The open source Sci2 tool (http://sci2.cns.iu.edu) supports temporal, geospatial, topical, and network studies. The scalability of the infrastructure is examined. Results show that temporal analyses scale linearly with the number of records and file size, while the geospatial algorithm showed quadratic growth. The number of edges rather than nodes determined performance for network based algorithms.

AB Digital biomarkers of mental health, created using data extracted from everyday technologies including smartphones, wearable devices, social media and computer interactions, have the opportunity to revolutionise mental health diagnosis and treatment by providing near-continuous unobtrusive and remote measures of behaviours associated with mental health symptoms. Machine learning models process data traces from these technologies to identify digital biomarkers. In this editorial, we caution clinicians against using digital biomarkers in practice until models are assessed for equitable predictions ('model equity') across demographically diverse patients at scale, behaviours over time, and data types extracted from different devices and platforms. We posit that it will be difficult for any individual clinic or large-scale study to assess and ensure model equity and alternatively call for the creation of a repository of open de-identified data for digital biomarker development.

AB Psychology faces a so-called crisis of confidence as does sport psychology (see title of this special issue). While the debate on its causes and consequences is lively, the deduction of individual opportunities to collectively increase trust is missing. We propose ways out of this crisis and above all describe individual steps toward a reliable and open science. Reliable science refers to the publication of robust effects, as well as to direct and conceptual replications, and open science refers to transparency regarding the design (preregistration), the conducting (open material), and the analysis (open data, reproducible code) of scientific studies. The commitment to reliable and open science wilt change our behavior in the diverse roles within the scientific system (e.g., as researchers, reviewers, supervisors, editors, or members of commissions). In this sense, we consider the current discussion as a chance to enhance the trustworthiness of our findings and to ultimately create justified confidence.

AB As the historical homeland of the first freedom of information law, Sweden is universally well-known for its centuries-long traditions of government transparency and respect for individual freedoms and liberties that have been deeply rooted in public mentality of people since medieval times. Today, this nation is also emerging as a global leader in advancing open data phenomena, launching an extremely wide range of public platforms in the sphere. In this respect, this article is mostly presented as a policy review of the open data movement in this Nordic state through the prism of its traditional inclination toward philosophy of open government, open economy, open source software, open science, and even pirate politics. In an attempt to understand a highly context dependable and truly multidimensional nature of the phenomena, the research analyzes various political and socioeconomic backgrounds of the open data movement, tracing interesting patterns and promising networking trends that could be observed today in the communication between its key stakeholders and demonstrating in an intrinsically empirical and illustrative manner how its fundamental pillars such as civic engagement, direct participation and public-private partnerships are exactly promoted within one given society.

AB The drive towards open data aims at improving government transparency, motivating citizen participation and unlocking commercial innovation. However, various intertwining barriers hinder the adoption of open data. They are stemming from legislation and licensing, technology and operation, use level, institution and governance, as well as economic considerations. Through the use of social network analysis (SNA), this study identified 43 barriers faced by stakeholders in an open data project in Hong Kong and investigated their interdependencies. Hong Kong was selected as a representative case due to its relatively low ranking in the Global Open Data Index (24th) and poor data quality. It was found that the lack of an open data policy should be tackled as a matter of priority to provide technical guidance for the public sector, ensure data quality and achieve expected outcomes. It is also necessary to improve the IT literacy/mindset of the public sector, refine the governance structure relating to the delivery of open data initiatives, encourage engagement from private entities and provide a feedback loop for users. This study explored the interrelationships between various barriers to open data adoption and proposes practical recommendations to enhance open data development in the context of emerging "smart cities".

AB This paper presents a comparative analysis of rail transit and taxi by travel cost and time based on the large-scale taxi trip data and public transit schedule information in two major U.S. cities. To quantify the relative advantage of one mode over the other, we introduce the notion of travel gradient, which is travel cost difference divided by travel time difference. Based on the signs of travel cost and time differences, we classify all trips into four quadrants. Quadrant II trips are selected for further analysis because rail transit is identified to be competitive with taxi for such trips. We also explore the relation between various trip characteristics and travel gradient with and without considering the spatial variation of such a relation. Main research findings include: (1) around 70% of the taxi trips in the considered datasets can be substituted with rail transit trips if the maximum walking distance is 0.5 miles at each trip end; (2) for around 10% of taxi trips with both modes being viable, rail transit dominates taxi in both travel cost and time; for the rest, rail transit is competitive with taxi; (3) the marginal travel cost saving due to mode switching from taxi to rail transit is about $70; and (4) there exist clearly spatial variations of the relation between trip characteristics and travel gradient. The main policy recommendation from this study is that rail transit can be better marketed by highlighting its relative advantage over taxi in travel time and cost, especially for travels in certain directions and time periods.

TI Impact of Open Data Policies on Consent to Participate in Human Subjects
   Research: Discrepancies between Participant Action and Reported Concerns
SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID INFORMED-CONSENT; PSYCHOLOGICAL-RESEARCH; PRIVACY; ETHICS; SCIENCE
AB Research outlets are increasingly adopting open data policies as a requisite for publication, including studies with human subjects data. We investigated whether open data policies influence participants' rate of consent by randomly assigning participants to view consent forms with and without discussion of open data policies. No participants declined to participate, regardless of condition, nor did rates of drop-out vs. completion vary between conditions. Furthermore, no significant change in potential consent rates was reported when participants were openly asked about the influence of open data policies on their likelihood of consent. However, follow-up analyses indicated possible poor attention to consent forms, consistent with previous research. Moreover, thematic analysis of participants' considerations of open data policy indicated multiple considerations such as concerns regarding confidentiality, anonymity, data security, and study sensitivity. The impact of open data policies on participation raises complex issues at the intersection of ethics and scientific innovation. We conclude by encouraging researchers to consider participants as stakeholders in open data policy and by providing recommendations for open data policies in human subjects research.

AB Open Government Data (OGD) has become a widely employed tool by governments around the world to promote transparent and accountable policy-making. In the context of societal actors' ability to reuse such data, one of the most important features of ODG is its quality. Thus, through this research, we aim to address the level of data quality by introducing a new framework that constantly monitors and evaluates the OGD quality of Western Balkan (WB) National Open Data Portals. The advantage of the proposed framework is the integration on the portal level enabling information exposure about the quality dimension at any time. An additional value of the framework is the ability to provide recommendations with the intention of improving quality issues. The applicability and findings of the proposed framework are not limited to the WB and once contextualized that could be applied to other countries in the Eastern European that face similar data quality challenges.

AB Purpose: Open science that is truly accessible and transparent to all will enhance reproducibility. However, there are ethical and practical concerns in implementing open science practices, especially when working with populations who are systematically excluded from and marginalized in communication sciences and dis -orders (CSD) research, such as Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) from clinical populations. The purpose of this article was to discuss these concerns and present actionable steps to support open science in CSD research with BIPOC.Conclusions: In the movement toward open and reproducible science, the discipline of CSD must prioritize accessibility and transparency, in addition to the implementation of individual scientific practices. Such a focus requires building trust with BIPOC not only as research participants but also as valued leaders of the scientific community.

AB Open data promotes transparency and accountability as everyone can analyse it. Law enforcement and the judiciary are increasingly making data available, to increase trust and confidence in the criminal justice system. Due to privacy legislation, judicial open data - like court judgements - in Europe is usually anonymized. And even if the court judgement has been made public, the rest of the case file is usually not published. Therefore, the question arises to what extent criminological research into sentencing can make use of anonymized open data. We answer this question based on a case study in which we use the open data of the Dutch criminal justice system that is available on . Over the period 2015-2020, we analysed sentencing in 25,366 court judgements and investigated the relationship between sentence severity and the offender's use of advanced Information and Communication Technology (ICT). The most important results are, firstly, that offenders who use advanced ICT are sentenced to longer custodial sentences compared to other offenders. Secondly, sentencing research with open data is found to be feasible.
