In the second part, the Swedish case is briefly described and considered in light of the academic concerns that have been raised by the British debate. The situation in Sweden may be summarized in three points: First, there are many signs that the infrastructure for qualitative data archiving and re-use is being developed without the active participation of sufficient representatives of the qualitative research community; second, there are many signs that developing the infrastructure takes as a point of departure neo-positivistic or foundational epistemology, treating qualitative data in the same way as quantitative data, with all the methodological problems resulting from this; and third there are very few, if any, signs that serious academic debate has started in relation to all the issues that have been raised by the corresponding debate in Britain.""""

Among qualitative researchers there is neither a pervasive culture that exists to encourage the secondary analysis of data nor is there an extensive body of published sources that can help guide or instruct a researcher wishing to understand better the benefits and limitations of re-analysis. So where does the student or novice researcher turn for guidance and training? In this paper we set out ways in which ESDS Qualidata (University of Essex) has sought to facilitate both usage of archived qualitative data and methodological debate among the wider academic communities. We will present an overview of the current published literature and existing training provision for secondary analysis of qualitative data and describe the various approaches to support and training taken by our service. Finally, we will cover the preparation of potentially useful kinds of training materials (teaching datasets, user guides, commentary and exercises) that we believe will help support teachers and learners to incorporate secondary analysis methodology into everyday research culture and practice.;;;A diferencia de los enfoques cuantitativos, la literatura publicada sobre análisis secundario de datos cualitativos es escasa.

The first is the establishment of the Qualitative Data Archival Resource Centre ( QUALIDATA, and, since 2003, ESDS Qualidata) at the University of Essex in 1994. The second is the publication of the Economic and Social Research Council ( ESRC) Datasets Policy ( 1996) which asks that those in receipt of ESRC grants offer copies of their data for deposit to QUALIDATA. This perceived injunction to archive data has been met with resistance by recalcitrant researchers who are wary of the implications of depositing data, and the possibilities of reusing data. The debate risks becoming polarised between those advocating the archiving and reuse of qualitative data, and those more sceptical of these possibilities. This paper aims to open up this debate and to seek a more fruitful path between these positions. I begin by calling into question the supposed 'newness' of reusing qualitative data, through turning to examine some of the assumptions embedded in the key terms and premises of the debate thus far, including the reliance on distinctions between primary and secondary data and primary and secondary analysis. I examine some common tropes in accounts of reusing data: comparisons with secondary analysis of quantitative data; efforts to distinguish between reusing qualitative data in a sociological context and other disciplinary and methodological traditions; and reliance on particular interpretations of key principles of qualitative research, context and reflexivity, in establishing the challenges of the reusing of qualitative data. I suggest that reuse may be more productively understood as a process of recontextualising data, and that attending to the reflexive production of data in the contemporary research project may offer more hopeful possibilities for reuse. I conclude by offering some reflections on why discussions of reusing qualitative data appear to have become so fraught.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Included"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Included""""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: screening full text | USER-NOTES: {""""Jürgen""""=>[""""barriers/facilitators?""""]}","","",,,,screening full text,Included,Included,1

The paper argues for an appreciation of the contexts involved in the generation of research material which takes into account both the development of the study and related fieldwork processes as well as the academic context in which knowledge is produced, particularly those involved in the construction of academic selves and professional careers, which are part of a wider situation bearing upon scientific enquiry.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Included"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Included""""}","","",,,,,Included,Included,1

Although each discipline has unique challenges and characteristics which can influence data sharing and re-use behavior, it may be possible to gain transferable insight from disciplines where these practices are more common. Several studies of the motivations underlying data sharing and re-use have been conducted, however these studies often remain at a high level of abstraction rather than providing in-depth insight about discipline-specific challenges and opportunities. This study sought to provide in-depth insight about the complex interaction of factors influencing motivations for sharing and re-using open research data within a single discipline, namely astrophysics. We focused on this discipline due to its well-developed tradition of free and open access to research data. Eight factors were found to influence researchers' motivations for sharing data openly, including the researcher's background, personal drivers, experience, legislation, regulation and policy, data characteristics, performance expectancy, usability, and collaboration. We identified six factors that influence researchers' motivations to re-use open research data, including the researcher's background, facilitating conditions, expected performance, social and affiliation factors, effort and experience. Finally, we discuss how data sharing and re-use can be encouraged within the context of astrophysics research, and we discuss how these insights may be transferred to disciplines with low rates of data sharing and re-use.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 _not_qualitative/_video_data_",10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2019.05.024,MODEL;CONSUMPTION;SCIENTISTS;MANAGEMENT;Motivation,,,2 _not_qualitative/_video_data_,,Excluded,Excluded,1

There has also been a more fundamental claim: to the effect that these problems are much less severe once we recognise that, all data are constituted and re-constituted within the research process.

The paper begins with a brief review of the present UK social science research environment, highlighting the evidence for an increasing Research Council focus on interdisciplinary research and secondary analysis/re-use of data. It argues that this shift in focus gives rise to unique methodological challenges such as those encountered by the authors in this project. After providing some background and context, the paper discusses different obstacles encountered in the course of setting up this project. These include difficulties in: communicating within and across disciplines; re-using data across disciplines; the use of metadata, and its role in choosing writers from a longitudinal secondary data source; choice of analytical tools and approaches; and the Mass Observation writer's role in the research process. By sharing these experiences, the paper seeks to enable potential users of the MOP to see the value of MOP as a source of longitudinal qualitative secondary data; appreciate its potential for use with other data sources and across different disciplines; and equip other researchers to meet some of the challenges that the longitudinal use of MOP writing throws up.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Included"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Included""""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: research",10.5153/sro.3362,"",,,,research,Included,Included,1

Such learning healthcare models have generated ethical debate in high-income countries, including on the role of patient and public consent and engagement. Increasing use of electronic health records in low-middle income countries offers important potential to fast-track healthcare improvements in these settings, where a disproportionate burden of global morbidity occurs. Core ethical issues have been raised around the role and form of information sharing processes for learning healthcare systems, including individual consent and individual and public general notification processes, but little research has focused on this perspective in low-middle income countries.MethodsWe conducted a qualitative study on the role of information sharing and governance processes for inpatient data re-use, using in-depth interviews with 34 health stakeholders at two public hospitals on the Kenyan coast, including health managers, providers and researchers. Data were collected between March and July 2016 and analysed using a framework approach, with Nvivo 10 software to support data management.ResultsMost forms of clinical data re-use were seen as an important public health good. Individual consent and general notification processes were often argued as important, but contingent on interrelated influences of the type of data, use and secondary user. Underlying concerns were linked to issues of patient privacy and autonomy; perceived risks to trust in health systems; and fairness in how data would be used, particularly for non-public sector re-users. Support for engagement often turned on the anticipated outcomes of information-sharing processes, as building or undermining trust in healthcare systems.ConclusionsAs reported in high income countries, learning healthcare systems in low-middle counties may generate a core ethical tension between supporting a public good and respecting patient autonomy and privacy, with the maintenance of public trust acting as a core requirement. While more evidence is needed on patient and public perspectives on learning healthcare activities, greater collaboration between public health and research governance systems is likely to support the development of efficient and locally responsive learning healthcare activities in LMICs.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: background article,5_adresses_government_health,2 _not_qualitative/_video_data_,3 _not_human_observation_response_data,4_not_prerequisites_barriers_facilitators_",10.1186/s12910-018-0343-9,INFORMED-CONSENT;RECORDS;PRIVACY;PATIENT;ETHICS;TRIALS;INFORMATION;RISK;TOOL,,,"background article,5_adresses_government_health,2 _not_qualitative/_video_data_,3 _not_human_observation_response_data,4_not_prerequisites_barriers_facilitators_",,Excluded,Excluded,1

Design/methodology/approach This paper presents a real experience of translating qualitative data from Arabic to English within the management area in Saudi Arabia. Data were collected from interviewing female managers working in the Saudi public sector.        Findings Translating qualitative data from Arabic to English is not a straightforward process. During the translation of this cross-cultural qualitative research, three challenges were faced: the embeddedness of the language meaning in the culture, positionality and its influence on data production and language differences. The study found that, in absence of a standard way for translating cross-linguistic qualitative research, a combination of methods is found to be useful to increase the validity and reliability of the study findings. Researchers who conduct qualitative insider research and who translate their own data are in a better position to do cross-language data analysis.        Originality/value This paper contributes to the literature by showing that translating Arabic texts regarding gender, management and leadership is embedded within historical, cultural, political and institutional contexts, requiring a deep understanding of both language and culture to produce a depth of knowledge. Also, the novelty of this study is that it highlights the importance of being an insider qualitative researcher and translating the research data, as researcher offers significant opportunities for close attention to certain points in the text; and this could add value to the analysis as a way to establish validity of interpretations.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using",10.1108/GM-03-2016-0029,CAREER-DEVELOPMENT;REFLECTIONS;EXPERIENCES;GENDER,,,1 not sharing/ not using,,Excluded,Excluded,1

We first consider practical and interpretive decisions in archiving qualitative data, then map current policy and regulatory frameworks governing research data management, taking Australia as a case-study. We argue that governance and protocols for data sharing have not attended sufficiently to the distinctive ethical and methodological dimensions and knowledge claims of qualitative research. Instead, approaches associated with quantitative data are extrapolated in ways which construct an imaginary of decontextualised data, abstracted from the conditions of its production. We further argue for more critical attention to the double-edged affordances and ambivalent effects of data sharing and openness and to how data archives are imagined, constructed and curated. This includes greater acknowledgement of the affective and temporal dynamics involved in data archiving, understanding them as practices of (re)invention that also curate 'archives for the future' and help to foster an historicising imaginary in educational research.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Included"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Included""""}",10.1080/00131857.2020.1805310     EA AUG 2020,HISTORY;FUTURE;TIME;Information Dissemination,,,,,Included,Included,1

However, first hand primary data collection is not always possible, often due to external circumstances. Additionally, the use of secondary data, particularly open data, is progressively preferred to increase efficiency and gain geographical breadth. Therefore, this paper proposes a new step-by-step secondary qualitative inquiry methodology for online, publicly available interview data. Such procedural approach can help increase rigor, explicitly consider and mitigate potential pitfalls, and expand the research community's datasets. The 7-step methodology is based on a hybrid approach with elements of pragmatic qualitative approach, discursive grounded theory, and narrative approach and refers to research ethical principles of autonomy, equity, and diversity. One of the proposed steps is data quality assessment, which consists of quality assessment of data context and data content with a total of 16 quality dimensions to filter the collected data. The data analysis method comprises of content analysis for dataset categorization and thematic discourse analysis to answer the pre-set research questions. Additionally, the methodology covers the ethical and legal considerations relating to secondary online data and reporting the research findings of such data. By providing an example in the field of forced migration, we demonstrate how the methodology provides structure when conducting secondary qualitative research.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 4_not_prerequisites_barriers_facilitators_",10.1177/16094069231180160,CREDIBILITY;EXPERIENCES;ISSUES;MODELS;Research Design,,,4_not_prerequisites_barriers_facilitators_,,Excluded,Excluded,1

In doing so, there is no intention of dismissing the importance of ethical debates, in fact, quite the opposite. The debate about ethical reuse needs to be deepened and broadened. First, the current terrain of research ethics will be summarised and situated in the context of broader philosophical ethical frameworks. In contrast, the debates around ethics of archiving have often been narrowly focused on participants' rights. The framework of debate should be broadened first by recognising other entities traditionally deemed within the scope of research ethics, namely the scholarly community and the public. The second useful broadening of the framework is provided by a deontological ethical stance with its focus on duties. In the final section, this expanded framework will be used to rebut several common ethical arguments against archiving qualitative data: archiving violates confidentiality; informed consent for reusing data is impossible; reusing data violates trust between researcher and participant; and, archiving creates an unacceptably high risk of data misrepresentation. If a more general philosophical debate on ethics has something to contribute, the central message must be that no single ethical claim is incontestable. The conclusion will position these debates in a wider context by asking what is at stake when the boundaries of ethical discourse about sharing data are drawn too narrowly.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Included"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Included""""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: research",10.1002/j.1839-4655.2009.tb00145.x,"",,,,research,Included,Included,1

It studied how reusers' purposes and experience-level with VRP reuse influence the importance of various VRP selection criteria and how these differ depending on whether the main goal for reuse was research or teaching. It also examined whether two different dimensions of qualitative research - reflexivity and context - were factors in VRP reuse. Design/methodology/approach The study reports on surveys of reusers at four VRP repositories. Questions were based on the literature and interviews with VRP reusers. The response rate was 20.6% (180 of 872 distributed surveys). This paper focused on 126 respondents who affirmatively responded they reused VRPs from a repository. Findings Researchers using VRPs were primarily interested in examining a broad range of processes in education and studying/improving ways to measure differences and growth in education. Reusers with teaching goals were commonly interested in VRPs to engage learners in showing examples/exemplars of - and reflecting on - teaching and learning. These differences between research and teaching led to varied expectations about VRPs, such as the amount of content needed and necessary contextual information to support reuse. Research limitations/implications While repositories focus on exposing content, understanding and communicating certain qualities of that content can help reusers identify VRPs and align goals with selection decisions. Originality/value Although qualitative data are increasingly reused, research has rarely focused on identifying how qualitative data reusers employ selection criteria. This study focused on VRPs as one type of qualitative data and identified the attributes of VRPs that reusers perceived to be important during selection.

Reuse provides an opportunity to study the raw materials of past research projects to gain methodological and substantive insights. In the past decade, use of the approach has grown rapidly in the United Kingdom to become sufficiently accepted that it must now be regarded as mainstream. Several factors explain this growth: the open data movement, research funders' and publishers' policies supporting data sharing, and researchers seeing benefits from sharing resources, including data. Another factor enabling qualitative data reuse has been improved services and infrastructure that facilitate access to thousands of data collections. The UK Data Service is an example of a well-established facility; more recent has been the proliferation of repositories being established within universities. This article will provide evidence of the growth of data reuse in the United Kingdom and in Finland by presenting both data and case studies of reuse that illustrate the breadth and diversity of this maturing research method. We use two distinct data sources that quantify the scale, types, and trends of reuse of qualitative data: (a) downloads of archived data collections held at data repositories and (b) publication citations. Although the focus of this article is on the United Kingdom, some discussion of the international environment is provided, together with data and examples of reuse at the Finnish Social Science Data Archive.

Reliable data generated from 'the things people say' should not be seen as inherently 'less worthy' than reliable data from any other source. In fact, once reliability is established, frequency output from coded discourse can be treated much as frequencies from any engineered system, and are just as amenable to statistical manipulation. The result of taking the time to analyse such data fully is an integrated risk management system where the 'soft' versus 'hard' data distinction is replaced by a,reliable' versus 'unreliable' data model, this paradigm offering maximum benefit from data collected.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using,3 _not_human_observation_response_data",10.1205/psep.04239,RELIABILITY;AGREEMENT;ISSUES;Risk Management,,,"1 not sharing/ not using,3 _not_human_observation_response_data",,Excluded,Excluded,1

The management of these large data sets can lead to numerous challenges in establishing trustworthiness of the study. This article reports on strategies utilized in data collection and analysis of a large qualitative study to establish trustworthiness. Specific strategies undertaken by the research team included training of interviewers and coders, variation in participant recruitment, consistency in data collection, completion of data cleaning, development of a conceptual framework for analysis, consistency in coding through regular communication and meetings between coders and key research team members, use of N6 (TM) software to organize data, and creation of a comprehensive audit trail with internal and external audits. Finally, we make eight recommendations that will help ensure rigour for studies with large qualitative data sets: organization of the study by a single person; thorough documentation of the data collection and analysis process; attention to timelines; the use of an iterative process for data collection and analysis; internal and external audits; regular communication among the research team; adequate resources for timely completion; and time for reflection and diversion. Following these steps will enable researchers to complete a rigorous, qualitative research study when faced with large data sets to answer complex health services research questions.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health",10.1177/160940691201100305,"",,,5_adresses_government_health,,Excluded,Excluded,1

Furthermore, the danger of methodological biases and distortion arising from the use of certain software packages is overemphasized in current discussions, as far as basic tasks of textual data management ('coding and retrieval') usually performed by this software are concerned. However, with the development of more advanced and complex coding and retrieval techniques, which are regarded by some authors as tools for 'theory building' in qualitative research, methodological confusion may arise if basic prerequisites of qualitative theory building are not taken into consideration.

We discuss how working across international contexts involved the authors in new 'translational' work to address the challenges of establishing and sharing meaning.

Specifically, qualitative researchers are uneasy about the foundational assumptions underpinning current data preservation and sharing policies and practices. Efforts to address these concerns argue that the inclusion of the 'contexts' of data generation, preservation and reuse will adequately resolve the epistemological concerns held by the qualitative research community. However, these 'solutions' reproduce foundational assumptions by treating 'context' as ontologically separate from, rather than constitutive of, data. The future of qualitative data preservation and sharing in the social sciences is dependent on shedding its implicit unitary foundational model of qualitative research, and embracing 'epistemic pluralism' and the diversity of philosophical perspectives representing the qualitative researcher community.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Included"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Included""""}",10.1002/j.1839-4655.2009.tb00147.x,"",,,,,Included,Included,1

This failure may partly be explained by: a lack of awareness amongst health policy makers of the increasing wealth of qualitative data available; and around 15 years of internal debates among qualitative researchers on the strengths, limitations and validity of re-use of qualitative data. Whilst acknowledging the challenges of qualitative secondary data analysis, we argue that there is a growing imperative to be pragmatic and to undertake analysis of existing qualitative data collections where they have the potential to contribute to health policy formulation. Time pressures are inherent in the policy-making process and in many circumstances it is not possible to seek funding, conduct and analyse new qualitative studies of patients' experiences in time to inform a specific policy. The danger then is that the patient voice, and the experiences of relatives and carers, is either excluded or included in a way that is easily dismissed as 'unrepresentative'.

Besides obvious reasons such as ownership - and especially the culture of individualistic ownership - that impede reusing data, there is also methodological skepticism about secondary analysis. In this paper, I will argue in favor of sharing qualitative data on behalf of secondary analysis. The argument is partly based on - and much inspired by - the discussions during the preparation of a collaborative project of thirteen researchers who were invited to analyze the same set of interview data from their own theoretical/methodological viewpoint (VAN DEN BERG, WETHERELL & HOUTKOOP-STEENSTRA, 2003). During these discussions several methodological arguments against secondary analysis were put forward. In this paper I will deal with some of these arguments, especially the doubts about the usefulness of secondary analysis and the argument concerning the assumed risk of decontextualization: Is secondary analysis possible without in-depth knowledge of the context? Different theoretical and methodological positions concerning the contextualization of interview discourse will be scrutinized. On the one hand I argue against the tendency to include the ever-widening societal and historical context on behalf of the analysis of interview discourse. This tendency runs the risk of speculative social theorizing as a framework for interpreting interview discourse. On the other hand I do not think that the neglect of every social context outside interview talk - as advocated by some strands within conversation analysis - is fruitful or even possible. This neglect runs the risk of abstract empiricism. The main argument is that the kind and measure of contextualization of interview data needed on behalf of discourse analysis should depend on the research goal and the type of data.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: theory | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 4_not_prerequisites_barriers_facilitators_","",CONVERSATION ANALYSIS;INTERPRETATIVE REPERTOIRES;DISCOURSE ANALYSIS;POSTSTRUCTURALISM;DIALOGUE;CONTEXT,,,4_not_prerequisites_barriers_facilitators_,theory,Excluded,Excluded,1

Researchers are increasingly encouraged to undertake secondary analysis of qualitative data, despite epistemological and ethical challenges. Interpretive focus groups can be described as a more participative method for groups to analyse qualitative data.        Objective: To facilitate interpretive focus groups with women in Papua New Guinea to extend analysis of existing qualitative data and co-create new primary data. The purpose of this was to inform a transformational grounded theory and subsequent health promoting action.        Design: A two-step approach was used in a grounded theory study about how women experience male circumcision in Papua New Guinea. Participants analysed portions or 'chunks' of existing qualitative data in story circles and built upon this analysis by using the visual research method of storyboarding.        Results: New understandings of the data were evoked when women in interpretive focus groups analysed the data 'chunks'. Interpretive focus groups encouraged women to share their personal experiences about male circumcision. The visual method of storyboarding enabled women to draw pictures to represent their experiences. This provided an additional focus for whole-of-group discussions about the research topic.        Conclusions: Interpretive focus groups offer opportunity to enhance trustworthiness of findings when researchers undertake secondary analysis of qualitative data. The co-analysis of existing data and co-generation of new data between research participants and researchers informed an emergent transformational grounded theory and subsequent health promoting action.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health",10.3402/gha.v7.25214,MALE CIRCUMCISION;HIV PREVENTION;MEN;Focus Groups,,,5_adresses_government_health,,Excluded,Excluded,1

If poorly addressed, uncertainty can lead to adverse patient outcomes.        Aim: We aimed to understand patient experiences of uncertainty in advanced illness and develop a typology of patients' responses and preferences to inform practice.        Design: Secondary analysis of qualitative interview transcripts. Studies were assessed for inclusion and interviews were sampled using maximum-variation sampling. Analysis used a thematic approach with 10% of coding cross-checked to enhance reliability.        Setting/participants: Qualitative interviews from six studies including patients with heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal disease, cancer and liver failure.        Results: A total of 30 transcripts were analysed. Median age was 75 (range, 43-95), 12 patients were women. The impact of uncertainty was frequently discussed: the main related themes were engagement with illness, information needs, patient priorities and the period of time that patients mainly focused their attention on (temporal focus). A typology of patient responses to uncertainty was developed from these themes.        Conclusion: Uncertainty influences patient experience in advanced illness through affecting patients' information needs, preferences and future priorities for care. Our typology aids understanding of how patients with advanced illness respond to uncertainty. Assessment of these three factors may be a useful starting point to guide clinical assessment and shared decision making.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health",10.1177/0269216316647610,CHRONIC HEART-FAILURE;AMBER CARE BUNDLE;OF-LIFE CARE;PALLIATIVE CARE;HEALTH-CARE;COMMUNICATION;CANCER;END;DISEASE;NEEDS,,,5_adresses_government_health,,Excluded,Excluded,1

Oncologists and urologists mainly reported cooperating for tumour-specific treatment tasks, while GPs' reasoning for cooperation was more patient-centred. While oncologists and urologists reported experiencing reciprocal communication with other physicians, GPs had to gather the information they needed. GPs seldom reported engaging in formal cooperation structures, while for specialists, participation in formal spaces of cooperation, such as tumour boards, facilitated a more frequent and informal discussion of patients, for instance on the phone. Further research should focus on ways to foster GPs' integration in cancer care and evaluate if this can be reached by incorporating GPs in formal cooperation structures such as tumour boards.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health",10.1111/ecc.12675,MULTIDISCIPLINARY TEAM MEETINGS;GENERAL-PRACTITIONERS;DECISION-MAKING;TUMOR BOARDS;COMMUNICATION;ONCOLOGISTS;MANAGEMENT;IMPROVE;VIEWS;INVOLVEMENT,,,5_adresses_government_health,,Excluded,Excluded,1

In qualitative trauma research, data sharing could compromise participants' safety, privacy, and confidentiality because narrative data can be more difficult to de-identify fully. There is little guidance in the traumatology literature regarding how to discuss data-sharing requirements with participants during the informed consent process. Within a larger research project in which we interviewed assault survivors, we developed and evaluated a protocol for informed consent for qualitative data sharing and engaging participants in data de-identification. Method: We conducted qualitative interviews with N = 32 adult sexual assault survivors regarding (a) how to conduct informed consent for data sharing, (b) whether participants should have input on sharing their data, and (c) whether they wanted to redact information from their transcripts prior to archiving. Results: No potential participants declined participation after learning about the archiving mandate. Survivors indicated that they wanted input on archiving because the interview is their story of trauma and abuse and it would be disempowering not to have control over how this information was shared and disseminated. Survivors also wanted input on this process to help guard their privacy, confidentiality, and safety. None of the participants elected to redact substantive data prior to archiving. Conclusions: Engaging participants in the archiving process is a feasible practice that is important and empowering for trauma survivors.        Clinical Impact Statement Researchers are often expected or required to archive their data in national repositories. Sharing data from trauma research studies could compromise participants' safety, privacy, and confidentiality, so researchers must take extra precautions. In this study, we developed and evaluated a trauma-informed archiving protocol. During the consent process, we explained data sharing to our participants and offered them options for what information would be archived and how it would be archived.

BackgroundNumbers of older patients are increasing in acute hospital contextscontexts that place their focus on patient safety. Nurses need to manage tensions between older peoples' risks, evidence-informed practice decisions, limited resources and organisational emphases on patient falls. To date, their practice dilemmas have not been well examined.        DesignA secondary qualitative descriptive analysis was conducted using data that were collected between June 2010 and May 2011 to examine nursing practice with hospitalised older people.        MethodsAll field notes and transcribed data were reviewed to generate themes representing 18 Registered Nurses' perceptions about safe care for hospitalised older people. The first author generated categories that described how nurses construct definitions of safety risks for older people. All authors engaged in an iterative analytic process that resulted in themes capturing nurses' efforts to provide care in limited resource environments while considering older peoples' safety risks.        ResultsNurses constructed definitions of patient safety risks in the context of institutional directives. Nurses provided care using available resources as efficiently as possible and accessing co-worker support. They also minimised the importance of older people's functional abilities by setting priorities for medically delegated tasks and immobilising their patients to reduce their risks.        ConclusionsNurses' definitions of patient risk, which were shaped by impoverished institutional resources and nurses' lack of valuing of functional abilities, contributed to suboptimal care for older adults. Nurses' definitions of risk as physical injury reduced their attention to patients' functional abilities, which nurses reported suffered declines as a result.        Implications for practiceLeaders need to examine how organisational emphases on particular areas of patient safety and resource constraints contribute to suboptimal care of older people.

Furthermore, the article will show how an additional theoretical sampling can extend the empirically grounded composition of contrast groups and can build upon the quantitative secondary data.

In each primary study, male and female participants were interviewed for 1-2 h and asked to describe recommendations they had received for bone health and what they were doing about those recommendations. Maintaining the phenomenological approach of the primary studies, the transcripts of all male participants were re-analyzed to highlight experiences and behaviours particular to men.        Twenty-two men (50-88 years old) were identified. Sixteen lived with a wife, male partner, or family member and the remaining participants lived alone. Participants had sustained hip fractures (n = 7), wrist fractures (n = 5), vertebral fractures (n = 2) and fractures at other locations (n = 8). Fourteen were taking antiresorptive medication at the time of the interview. In general, men with a wife/female partner described these women as playing an integral role in their health behaviours, such as removing tripping hazards and organizing their medication regimen. While participants described giving up activities due to their bone health, they also described taking risks such as drinking too much alcohol and climbing ladders or deliberately refusing to adhere to bone health recommendations. Finally, men did not dwell on the meaning of the fracture and/or their bone health.        Behaviours consistent with those shown in other studies on men were described by our sample. We recommend that future research address these findings in more detail so that communication strategies specific to men about bone health be developed.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health",10.1007/s00198-016-3641-4,OSTEOPOROSIS MEDICATION;OLDER MEN;CARE;KNOWLEDGE;WOMEN;RISK;MASCULINITY;MORTALITY;DECISION;DENSITY;Men's Health;Bone and Bones,,,5_adresses_government_health,,Excluded,Excluded,1

Background: Medication nonadherence is prevalent in HF but the factors contributing to it are not well understood.        Methods: This secondary data analysis of qualitative data explored narrative accounts about medication adherence from four previous studies (N = 112). The Necessity Concerns Framework derived from the Common Sense Model (CSM) of Self-Regulation guided the interpretation of themes.        Results: In this diverse sample (39% Black, 6% Hispanic, 63% male; mean age 59 15 years), 90% reported at least intermittent nonadherence. For many (60%), missing medication was unintentional but 27% reported intentional nonadherence. Four interconnected patterns of behavior emerged: 1) rarely non adherent, 2) frequently nonadherent, 3) intentionally nonadherent, and 4) reformed nonadherent. Misperceptions about HF, beliefs, concerns, and contextual factors contributed to both intentional and unintentional nonadherence.

For addressing future health care needs, insurance companies require access to health data to deliver preventative and proactive digital health services to customers. However, extant research is limited in examining the conditions that incentivize health data sharing.        Objective: This study aimed to (1) identify the expectations of insurance customers when sharing health data, (2) determine the perceived intrinsic value of health data, and (3) explore the conditions that aid in incentivizing health data sharing in the relationship between an insurance organization and its customer.        Methods: A Web-based survey was distributed to randomly selected customers from a Finnish insurance organization through email. A single open-text answer was used for a qualitative data analysis through inductive coding, followed by a thematic analysis. Furthermore, the 4 constructs of commitment, power, reciprocity, and trust from the social exchange theory (SET) were applied as a framework.        Results: From the 5000 customers invited to participate, we received 452 surveys (response rate: 9.0%). Customer characteristics were found to reflect customer demographics. Of the 452 surveys, 48 (10.6%) open-text responses were skipped by the customer, 57 (12.6%) customers had no expectations from sharing health data, and 44 (9.7%) customers preferred to abstain from a data sharing relationship. Using the SET framework, we found that customers expected different conditions to be fulfilled by their insurance provider based on the commitment, power, reciprocity, and trust constructs. Of the 452 customers who completed the surveys, 64 (14.2%) customers required that the insurance organization meets their data treatment expectations (commitment). Overall, 4.9% (22/452) of customers were concerned about their health data being used against them to profile their health, to increase insurance prices, or to deny health insurance claims (power). A total of 28.5% (129/452) of customers expected some form of benefit, such as personalized digital health services, and 29.9% (135/452) of customers expected finance-related compensation (reciprocity). Furthermore, 7.5% (34/452) of customers expected some form of empathy from the insurance organization through enhanced transparency or an emotional connection (trust).        Conclusions: To aid in the design and development of digital health services, insurance organizations need to address the customers' expectations when sharing their health data. We established the expectations of customers in the social exchange of health data and explored the perceived values of data as intangible goods. Actions by the insurance organization should aim to increase trust through a culture of transparency, commitment to treat health data in a prescribed manner, provide reciprocal benefits through digital health services that customers deem valuable, and assuage fears of health data being used to prevent providing insurance coverage or increase costs.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health",10.2196/16102,SOCIAL-EXCHANGE THEORY;ACCESS;CARE,,,5_adresses_government_health,,Excluded,Excluded,1

Methods We describe a 'Next-Generation' mixed-method approach to reporting qualitative data that combines the advantages of traditional qualitative analysis (assessing depth of meaning from participants themselves) with those of descriptive analysis (assessing breadth and representativeness). We used our Next-Generation approach to conduct a secondary analysis of qualitative data derived from a systematic search of PubMed. A formal coding scheme was developed and systematically applied to 2050 respondent quotations contained in the 74 selected articles; inter-rater agreement was high (kappa = 0.90). Quotations were aggregated at the level of the article and reported to assess both narratives and numerical counts of the data.        Results The rate of qualitative research on the lived experience of diabetes has increased over the last 25 years. Both positive and negative aspects of lived experience were reported, although the former was less common. Data from many different populations were reported, but most studies emphasized breadth of coverage over depth. Some findings are well established and there is little benefit to repeating these studies. Best practices of qualitative methodology were often not utilized.        Conclusions The amount of qualitative research in diabetes is substantial and increasing. We recommend that future research be focused on specific understudied topics rather than repeating existing research. We also provide recommendations for how qualitative study methodology can be improved by implementing the Next-Generation approach.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",10.1111/dme.14255,ATTITUDES;WISHES;EXPERIENCES;DEPRESSION;INSIGHTS;CRITERIA;ADULT;CARE,,,"1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",,Excluded,Excluded,1

Research related to female drug users is rare in Kenya, yet it is required to inform the development of gender-sensitive HIV prevention and harm reduction services in East Africa, where injecting drug use is on the rise.MethodsThis studyaimed to document the nature of HIV risks encountered by women who inject drugs in the Mombasa and Kilifi, Kenya. Secondary data analysis was conducted on an existing dataset from a 2015 primary qualitative study involving 24 interviews and 3 focus group discussions with 45 women who inject drugs. These were complemented with five interviews with key stakeholders involved in the provision of services to women who inject drugs. Guided by the social ecology theory, a thematic analysis was conducted to identify the nature of HIV risks and their underlying determinants.ResultsHIV risk behaviours fell into two broad categories: unsafe injecting and unprotected sex. These risks occurred in the form of sharing of needles, unprotected oral, anal, and vaginal sex, sexual assaults, injecting drug use during sex, sex work, and other types of transactional sex. The primary determinants underlying these risks were a low-risk perception, inequitable gender power, economic pressures, and poor availability of needles and condoms. These social-ecological determinants did not exist in isolation, but intersected with each other to create powerful influences which exposed women to HIV. Social-ecological determinants exerted constant influence and created a persistent HIV risk environment' that was involuntarily experienced by women.ConclusionIndividual, interpersonal, and societal-structural factors intersect to produce HIV risk behaviours. As a minimum, these risks will require a combination of multifaceted micro-level interventions including self-efficacy training, risk assessment skills, couple counselling, and universal access to the recommended harm reduction package. In addition, the current focus on micro-level interventions in Kenya needs to shift to incorporate macro-level interventions, including livelihood, employability, and gender norms-transforming interventions, to mitigate economic and gender-related drivers of HIV risks. In the Kenyan context, injecting drug use during sex work is emerging as an increasingly important HIV risk behaviour needing to be addressed.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",10.1186/s12954-019-0281-y,SOCIAL ECOLOGY MODEL;HEALTH-SERVICES;SUBSTANCE-ABUSE;HARM REDUCTION;PEOPLE;INFECTION;GENDER;PREVALENCE;PREVENTION;PARTNERS;Kenya;HIV-1,,,"1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",,Excluded,Excluded,1

We aimed to better understand educational experiences of young people with ADHD in the UK, and make actionable recommendations for schools.Methods: In this secondary analysis of qualitative data, we used Thematic Analysis to analyse information relating to experiences of education from 64 young people with ADHD and 28 parents who participated in the Children and adolescents with ADHD in Transition between Children's services and adult Services (CATCh-uS) study. Emerging patterns within and across codes led to organization of the data into themes and subthemes through an iterative process.Results: Two main themes were generated. The first described young people's early experiences of education, often within a mainstream setting; we labelled this the problematic provision loop, as this was a negative cycle that was repeated several times for some participants. The second theme described young people's more positive progression through education once they progressed out of the problematic loop.Conclusions: Educational experiences for young people with ADHD are often negative and fraught with complication. Young people with ADHD often found themselves on a more positive trajectory after they were placed in an alternative form of education provision (mainstream or otherwise), or where they were able to study topics that interest them and play to their strengths.

Background Type 2 diabetes mellitus prevalence is increasing globally. Adherence to effective diabetes self-management regimens is an ongoing healthcare challenge. Examining individuals' sense-making processes can advance staff knowledge of and improve diabetes self-management behaviour.        Design A qualitative exploratory design examining how individuals make sense of blood glucose data and symptoms, and the influence on self-management decisions.        Methods Sixteen one-on-one interviews with adults diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus using a semi-structured interview guide were conducted from March-May 2018. An inductive-deductive thematic analysis of data using the Sensemaking Framework for Chronic Disease Self-Management was used. The consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research (COREQ) checklist were used in completing this paper.        Results Three main themes described participants' type 2 diabetes mellitus sense-making and influences on self-management decisions: classifying blood glucose data, building mental models and making self-management decisions.

We focus on three different areas of work. Across all of these we examine the potential explanatory value of working with data in a comparative way, and engage with some challenges presented by contextual specificity in the way qualitative data are generated. In the first area we consider the issue of how we situate qualitative data with reference to diversity across the population, and use an example of working between a single qualitative Timescapes data set and survey data. Understanding how qualitative data are situated offers a framework for internal comparison which maps onto wider diversity. In the second area we consider the outcome of bringing together primary researchers whose comparison of project data, as secondary analysts, allow them to 'hear silences' and, therefore, re-interrogate their own data within a revised conceptual framework. In the third area we describe how, as secondary analysts, we have worked across Timescapes data sets. Here we consider the challenges of undertaking secondary analysis across diverse, project specific, research contexts, and the potential of comparative working across data sets for enhancing understanding.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Included"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Included""""}",10.1177/1468794111426234,CHOICE,,,,,Included,Included,1

This is important for enhancing outcomes in individuals with complex needs, who consistently report poor experiences with care. The shift towards person-centred care (PCC) is, however, a radical departure from the norm, with increased expectations of both professional and patient. Although there have been studies on the ways in which health care professionals can modify practice to enhance PCC, not all patients welcome changes to their care delivery or understand the aim of the new approach. Without engagement and understanding from the patient, a PCC approach will fail to initiate. Few studies explore how, why and in what circumstances patients become more involved in their care and what professionals can do to enhance participation. We conducted a secondary analysis of qualitative data to examine this issue. Data were collected between 2014 and 2018 from primary care-based PCC projects across the southwest of England. Supported by people with experience (practitioners and those receiving treatment), theory building workshops developed an explanatory framework that identified contextual factors and mechanisms likely to contribute to effective engagement. Our results show that engagement in a care partnership is achieved through trust and a patient's sense of candidacy. Shared understanding of purpose, clarity of expectations and power sharing were found to facilitate trusted relationships between professional and patient and encourage candidacy. Only then is it possible to develop goals that are meaningful to the patient. Our theory of engagement applies to professionals and patients alike but places the initial burden of responsibility on those who hold the most power: the professional and the system. This theory has the potential to explain patient engagement in PCC and a range of other service interventions, treatments and intervention research.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health",10.1111/hsc.13406     EA MAY 2021,CARE;EMPOWERMENT;MECHANISMS;DOCTOR,,,5_adresses_government_health,,Excluded,Excluded,1

This belief is seemingly so inscribed in research that it is rarely interrogated. The present paper re-analyses qualitative data from a hospital-based study of self-harm management and prevention practice. It aims to reflect upon, and disrupt, the authors' latent assumptions about the construct of 'prevention', while reflecting on the research method used. Twenty-five individuals participated in semi-structured interviews: healthcare and affiliated professionals (n = 14); parents and carers (n = 8); and children and young people (aged 9-16 years) who had presented to an emergency department for self-harm, with or without suicidal intent (n = 3). We offer two central discursive considerations: (1) Self-harm prevention is largely an unintelligible concept, having to be reflexively constructed in situ. As such, it is questionable whether it makes sense to discuss the prevention of this amorphous and dynamic phenomenon, which cannot always be disentangled from everyday life; (2) Interviews entail significant biographical work for participants, notably the performance of personal and professional competence for the audience. These interactional dynamics offer a glimpse into the priorities, meanings and needs for participants in relation to self-harm. Together these considerations provide useful insights into how the interview method can serve as both a limiting and illuminating site of knowledge creation.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",10.1177/13634593211038522     EA AUG 2021,SUICIDE-PREVENTION;INTERVIEW;PEOPLE;CARE;EXPERIENCES;ATTITUDES;SOCIETY;STAFF;Case-Control Studies,,,"1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",,Excluded,Excluded,1

However, patients can struggle to engage with practitioners and practitioners have indicated that they want more guidance on how to establish effective relationships with their patients.        Objective To identify what practitioner attributes patients with depression particularly value or find problematic.        Method A secondary analysis of data collected during four qualitative studies, all of which entailed interviewing patients diagnosed with depression about their treatment experiences. Patients in the four studies had received different treatments. These included antidepressants, cognitive behaviour therapy, facilitated physical activity and listening visits. We thematically analysed 32 patient accounts.        Results We identified two complimentary sets of important practitioner attributes: the first based on the practitioner's bearing; the second based on the practitioner's enabling role. We found that patients value practitioners who consider their individual manner, share relevant personal information, show interest and acceptance, communicate clearly and listen carefully, collaborate on manageable goals and sanction greater patient self-care and self-compassion. It was also evident that patients receiving different treatments value the same practitioner attributes and that when these key practitioner qualities were not evident, patients were liable not to re-attend or comply with treatment.        Conclusion The practitioner attributes that patients with depression most value have a positive impact on their engagement with treatment. Patients emphasise the importance of a practitioner's demeanour and encouragement, rather than the amount of time or specific treatment a practitioner is able to provide.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",10.1111/hex.12436,THERAPEUTIC ALLIANCE;SELF-COMPASSION;PRIMARY-CARE;GENERAL-PRACTICE;CONSULTATIONS;DISCLOSURE;PEOPLE;ISSUES,,,"1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",,Excluded,Excluded,1

Semi-structured qualitative interviews elicited participant feedback on the cognitive-behavioral intervention. Data was analyzed by two qualitative experts using MAXQDA software. Key word analyses focused on mention of analgesics in interviews.Findings: Interviews revealed a dominant theme of ambivalence towards postoperative use of opioids. An additional theme concerned the varied ways acquiring pain self-management skills impacted postoperative opioid (and non-opioid analgesic) consumption. Participants reported that employment of pain self -manage-ment strategies reduced reliance on pharmacology for pain relief, prolonged the time between doses, took the """"edge off"""" pain, and increased pain management self-efficacy.Conclusions: Perioperative patient education may benefit from inclusion of teaching non-pharmacologic pain self-management skills and collaborative planning with patients regarding how to use these skills in con-junction with opioid and non-opioid analgesics.

Design Secondary analysis of qualitative data from mixed methods, longitudinal study.        Setting and participants Eleven participants undergoing treatment for colorectal cancer. Semi-structured interviews were conducted twice with each participant, at the start and end of a 6-month course of chemotherapy treatment in a Scottish cancer centre.        Results Cues and barriers to engagement in self-management appeared to stem from perceptions of the impact and associated severity of side effects experiences as well as the perceptions about the efficacy of chosen self-management activities and perceptions of control in minimizing the consequences of cancer treatment. Severe, episodic or unexpected side effects coupled with perceptions of uncertainty, lack of control and lack of adequate preparation to engage in self-management were identified as key barriers to engagement.        Discussion and conclusion Participants' reflection on, or appraisal of, their treatment-related experiences and personal abilities, confidence and preferences to manage the impact of these shaped their subsequent engagement in self-management.

Design A secondary qualitative analysis of two data sources collected through semi-structured interviews for two different projects, SKINS project and Eczema Care Online project. Methods In total, there were 28 transcripts with adolescents and young adults with eczema having a mean age of 19.5 years available to analyse. Interview data were collected from face-to-face interviews that were recorded and transcribed. Inductive thematic analysis explored data about symptoms and organized according to psychosocial needs. Results Adolescents and young adults with eczema experience both visible symptoms (such as flaky, dry, and inflamed skin) and invisible symptoms (such as itch, pain, exhaustion, and mental distress) that elicit different psychosocial needs. These psychosocial needs are to (i) be understood; (ii) be perceived as normal; and (iii) receive emotional support. Interviewees described a struggle between wanting their peers and family to understand but take their eczema seriously whilst not wanting to stand out and instead to be perceived as 'normal', which they would define as being perceived as other adolescents. This has implications on behaviours, such as seeking support, avoiding going out, hiding their skin, as well as emotional implications, such as social isolation and feeling anxious and low. Conclusions Having a better understanding of young people's experiences and psychosocial needs will provide a framework on how best to support adolescents and young adults when managing symptoms related to eczema. Statement of contribution Whatisalready known on this subject? Eczema has a high impact on children and is considered a burden by children and adults with eczema. However, it is unclear what impact eczema has on adolescents and young adults. Adolescents and young adults with chronic conditions are known to be vulnerable to negative psychosocial outcomes but psychosocial needs and how to best support this age group with eczema are unknown Whatdoesthis add? Three psychosocial needs were developed from evaluating the impact of visible and invisible symptoms of eczema: The need to feel understood (mostly reflective of invisible symptoms such as itch and pain and visible symptoms such as scratching). The need to be perceived as 'normal': visible symptoms such as flaky, inflamed skin make them stand out in comparison with their peers and a need emerged to blend in. The need for emotional support: adolescents and young adults searched for this from their health care providers, from shared experiences and from online resources. Adolescents and young adults with eczema appear to feel ambivalent about wishing the impact of the condition to be acknowledged whilst wishing the condition to be invisible to others. This ambivalence had further impact on feeling self-conscious, seeking support, and dealing with unsolicited advice.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using",10.1111/bjhp.12467     EA AUG 2020,ATOPIC-DERMATITIS;SKIN-DISEASE;OF-LIFE;EPIDERMOLYSIS-BULLOSA;SUICIDAL IDEATION;HEALTH-CARE;CHILDREN;EXPERIENCES;PSORIASIS;PEOPLE;Adolescent;Eczema,,,1 not sharing/ not using,,Excluded,Excluded,1

This exposure increases the risk of children suffering both short-term and long-term impacts, including effects on their behaviour, social development, physical and mental health, educational attainment and quality of life. In addition, children living in environments where there is DV are at higher risk of maltreatment. Adult relatives and friends of the family often observe the experiences of children in situations of DV, and have the potential to shed light in a way that children and survivors may struggle to articulate, or be reluctant to acknowledge or disclose. Such accounts are largely absent from existing research, and yet bring a perspective which can broaden our understanding of the impact that DV has on children. This paper reports a secondary analysis of qualitative data collected during 21 in-depth interviews with people across the United Kingdom who were a friend or family member of a woman experiencing DV. An inductive thematic analysis was undertaken and the themes generated were as follows: 'the context of DV: a chaotic and unpredictable home life'; 'the roles children assume within households where there is DV including: witness of, victim of and conduit of violence and abuse',; 'the impacts of DV on children'; and 'children's coping and resilience'. The implications of these findings are discussed using a basic needs model lens.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health",10.1111/hsc.12893     EA NOV 2019,PARTNER VIOLENCE;PRIMARY-CARE;EXPOSURE;TRAUMA;HEALTH;ABUSE;MALTREATMENT;METAANALYSIS;PEOPLE;Only Child;Child;Survivors,,,5_adresses_government_health,,Excluded,Excluded,1

It examines reuse through the lens of the invisibilities experienced by educational researchers who perform secondary analysis on video records of practice. Drawing on 22 in-depth interviews with educational researchers, we examine how they conceptualize secondary analysis of qualitative video data and cope with invisibilities in the data. For example, knowing the original research question was not sufficient: reusers needed to understand more about the intentionality of the data producer. They also sought more information on the reflexivity of the original researcher and how this influenced data production. Additionally, reusers discussed the creation of evidence from the video during secondary analysis as teaching and learning themselves entail invisible processes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Included"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Included""""} | USER-NOTES: {""""Jürgen""""=>[""""barriers and facilitators only implicit""""]}",10.1177/14687941211005955     EA APR 2021,Video Recording,,,,,Included,Included,1

Excessive weight gain during pregnancy is associated with adverse maternal and neonatal consequences and increases the risk of long-term obesity. Pregnancy therefore may be a key time to prevent excessive weight gain and improve the health of women and their unborn child. This systematic review sought to assess the effectiveness of behavioural interventions to prevent excessive weight gain in pregnancy and explore the factors that influence intervention effectiveness.        Methods: We undertook a systematic review of quantitative and qualitative evidence. This included a meta-analysis of controlled trials of diet and physical activity interventions to prevent excessive weight gain during pregnancy and a thematic synthesis of qualitative studies that investigated the views of women on weight management during pregnancy. A thorough search of eleven electronic bibliographic databases, reference lists of included studies, relevant review articles and experts in the field were contacted to identify potentially relevant studies. Two independent reviewers extracted data. RevMan software was used to perform the meta-analyses. Qualitative data was subject to thematic analysis. Both quantitative and qualitative data were aligned using a matrix framework.        Results: Five controlled trials and eight qualitative studies were included. The overall pooled effect size found no significant difference in gestational weight gain amongst participants in the intervention group compared with the control group (mean difference -0.28 95% CI -0.64 to 0.09). The study designs, participants and interventions all varied markedly and there was significant heterogeneity within this comparison in the meta-analysis (I-2 67%). Subgroup and sensitivity analysis did not identify contextual elements that influenced the effectiveness of the intervention.        In a thematic analysis of the qualitative studies, three major themes emerged relating to women's views of weight management in pregnancy: pregnancy as a time of transition and change, conflicting and contradictory messages and a perceived lack of control. When the results of both quantitative and qualitative data were aligned it was clear that some of the barriers that women described in achieving healthy weight gain in pregnancy were not addressed by the interventions evaluated. This may have contributed to the limited effectiveness of the interventions.        Conclusions: Despite intense and often tailored interventions there was no statistically significant effect on weight gain during pregnancy. Inadequate and often contradictory information regarding healthy weight management was reported by women in qualitative studies and this was addressed in the interventions but this in itself was insufficient to lead to reduced weight gain. Multiple types of interventions, including community based strategies are needed to address this complex health problem.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",10.1186/1471-2458-11-491,LIFE-STYLE INTERVENTIONS;MATERNAL OBESITY;PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY;OVERWEIGHT WOMEN;AVERAGE-WEIGHT;GAIN;DIETARY;MOTHERS;TRIAL;Pregnancy,,,"1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",,Excluded,Excluded,1

Objective: This study assessed qualitatively the strengths and barriers regarding clinical coding quality from the perspective of health information managers. Method: Ten health information managers and clinical coding quality coordinators who oversee clinical coders (CCs) were identified and recruited from nine provinces across Canada. Semi-structured interviews were conducted, which included questions on data quality, costs of clinical coding, education for health information management, suggestions for quality improvement and barriers to quality improvement. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and analysed using directed content analysis and informed by institutional ethnography. Results: Common barriers to clinical coding quality included incomplete and unorganised chart documentation, and lack of communication with physicians for clarification. Further, clinical coding quality suffered as a result of limited resources (e.g. staffing and budget) being available to health information management departments. Managers unanimously reported that clinical coding quality improvements can be made by (i) offering interactive training programmes to CCs and (ii) streamlining sources of information from charts. Conclusion: Although clinical coding quality is generally regarded as high across Canada, clinical coding managers perceived quality to be limited by incomplete and inconsistent chart documentation, and increasing expectations for data collection without equal resources allocated to clinical coding professionals.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health",10.1177/1833358319855031     EA JUL 2019,ADMINISTRATIVE DATA;DOCUMENTATION QUALITY;VALIDITY;Research Design,,,5_adresses_government_health,,Excluded,Excluded,1

In qualitative research, we use internal validity checks like intercoder agreement to measure the extent to which independent researchers observe the same phenomena in data. Researchers report indices of agreement to serve as evidence of consistency and dependability of interpretations, and we do so to make claims about the trustworthiness of our research accounts. However, few studies report the methods of how multiple analysts developed alignment in their interpretation of data, a process that undergirds accounts of consistency, dependability, and trustworthiness. In this article, we review the issues and options around achieving intercoder agreement. Drawing on our experience from a longitudinal, team-based research project that required rapid cycles of qualitative data analysis, we reflect on the challenges we had achieving high intercoder agreement (which refer to as the perils). It was through these challenges that we developed a method that helps to foster shared ways of seeing data, and thus alignment in our interpretations of phenomena in data. In this article, we present this method as a tool for dyadic and team-based qualitative data analysis to facilitate reliable and consistent high-inference interpretations of data with multiple analysts.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using",10.1177/16094069231160973,DIALOGUE;RELIABILITY;INQUIRY,,,1 not sharing/ not using,,Excluded,Excluded,1

In Uganda, the primary source of malaria surveillance data is the Health Management Information System (HMIS). However, HMIS data may be incomplete, inaccurate or delayed. Collaborative improvement (CI) is a quality improvement intervention developed in high-income countries, which has been advocated for low-resource settings. In Kayunga, Uganda, a pilot study of CI was conducted in five public health centres, documenting a positive effect on the quality of HMIS and malaria surveillance data. A qualitative evaluation was conducted concurrently to investigate the mechanisms of effect and unintended consequences of the intervention, aiming to inform future implementation of CI. Methods The study intervention targeted health workers, including brief in-service training, plus CI with 'plan-do-study-act' (PDSA) cycles emphasizing self-reflection and group action, periodic learning sessions, and coaching from a CI mentor. Health workers collected data on standard HMIS out-patient registers. The qualitative evaluation (July 2015 to September 2016) included ethnographic observations at each health centre (over 12-14 weeks), in-depth interviews with health workers and stakeholders (n = 20), and focus group discussions with health workers (n = 6). Results The results suggest that the intervention did facilitate improvement in data quality, but through unexpected mechanisms. The CI intervention was implemented as planned, but the PDSA cycles were driven largely by the CI mentor, not the health workers. In this context, characterized by a rigid hierarchy within the health system of limited culture of self-reflection and inadequate training and supervision, CI became an effective form of high-quality training with frequent supervisory visits. Health workers appeared motivated to improve data collection habits by their loyalty to the CI mentor and the potential for economic benefits, rather than a desire for self-improvement. Conclusions CI is a promising method of quality improvement and could have a positive impact on malaria surveillance data. However, successful scale-up of CI in similar settings may require deployment of highly skilled mentors. Further research, focusing on the effectiveness of 'real world' mentors using robust study designs, will be required to determine whether CI can be translated effectively and sustainably to low-resource settings.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health",10.1186/s12936-021-03805-z,INFORMATION-SYSTEMS;CARE;Uganda;African Continental Ancestry Group;Malaria,,,5_adresses_government_health,,Excluded,Excluded,1

Studies have suggested that patients with osteoarthritis (OA) may prioritize comorbidities over their OA, but as yet no explicit systematic exploration of OA patients' priorities in relation to comorbidities exists. This study aims to explore how patients prioritize their OA among their conditions, which factors underlie this prioritization, and whether and why these priorities change over time. Methods A secondary analysis of qualitative data was conducted utilizing 4 existing data sets collated from the 3 research centers involved. Purposive sampling provided a sample of 30 participants who all had OA and comorbidities. The research team collectively coded and analyzed the data thematically. Results Three groups of patients emerged from the analysis. The 2 smaller groups had stable priorities (where OA was or was not prioritized) and illustrated the importance of factors, such as personal social context and the specific nature of the comorbid conditions. The third and largest group reported priorities that shifted over time. Shifting appeared to be influenced by the participants' perceptions of control and/or interactions with clinical professionals, and could have important consequences for self-management behavior.

However, research into public perceptions of using this data is limited. This study aimed to investigate public attitudes towards donating loyalty card data for academic health research, and the safeguards the public would want to see implemented. The way in which participant attitudes varied according to whether loyalty card data would be used for either cancer or COVID-19 research was also examined. Methods Participants (N = 40) were recruited via Prolific Academic to take part in semi-structured telephone interviews, with questions focused on data sharing related to either COVID-19 or ovarian/bowel cancer as the proposed health condition to be researched. Content analysis was used to identify sub-themes corresponding to the two a priori themes, attitudes and safeguards. Results Participant attitudes were found to fall into two categories, either rational or emotional. Under rational, most participants were in favour of sharing loyalty card data. Support of health research was seen as an important reason to donate such data, with loyalty card logs being considered as already within the public domain. With increased understanding of research purpose, participants expressed higher willingness to donate data. Within the emotional category, participants shared fears about revealing location information and of third parties obtaining their data. With regards to safeguards, participants described the importance of anonymisation and the level of data detail; the control, convenience and choice they desired in sharing data; and the need for transparency and data security. The change in hypothetical purpose of the data sharing, from Covid-19 to cancer research, had no impact on participants' decision to donate, although did affect their understanding of how loyalty card data could be used. Conclusions Based on interviews with the public, this study contributes recommendations for those researchers and the wider policy community seeking to obtain loyalty card data for health research. Whilst participants were largely in favour of donating loyalty card data for academic health research, information, choice and appropriate safeguards are all exposed as prerequisites upon which decisions are made.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health",10.1186/s12910-022-00795-8,"",,,5_adresses_government_health,,Excluded,Excluded,1

Qualitative data that were not ostensibly collected to measure prosociality might contain information about prosocial dispositions that is not distorted by self-presentation concerns. This paper seeks to characterise charitable donors from qualitative data. We compared a manual approach of extracting predictors from participants' self-described personal strivings to two automated approaches: A summation of words predefined as prosocial and a support vector machine classifier. Although variables extracted by the support vector machine predicted donation behaviour well in the training sample (N = 984), virtually, no variables from any method significantly predicted donations in a holdout sample (N = 496). Raters' attempts to predict donations to charity based on reading participants' personal strivings were also unsuccessful. However, raters' predictions were associated with past charitable involvement. In sum, predictors derived from personal strivings did not robustly explain variation in charitable behaviour, but personal strivings may nevertheless contain some information about trait prosociality. The sparseness of personal strivings data, rather than the irrelevance of open-ended text or individual differences in goal pursuit, likely explains their limited value in predicting prosocial behaviour.

Secondary data analysis poses a range of potential challenges for data creators, but also opportunities, including the ability to expand theory to a wider context, strengthen the reliability and validity of existing theory, gain access to populations that may be difficult to access, and to promote data archiving. The paper uses as a case study of secondary data analysis the results from our re-examination of data gathered previously in the European Union project Net Children Go Mobile, drawing from the interview transcripts from the 34 children in the UK data set. Our approach to secondary analysis was reanalysis, applying a new interpretive lens to the data that necessitated new questions in order to reveal hidden layers in the data. The data was analysed for evidence of information behaviour in order to understand how mobile technologies may be changing the way that young people seek and use information. The reanalysis of the data set supported existing models of information behaviour but revealed new ways of information seeking based on the affordances of screen size and data plans.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using,4_not_prerequisites_barriers_facilitators_",10.1177/0961000618769967,HIGH-SCHOOL-STUDENTS;SOCIAL NETWORK;GENERATION;INTERNET;WEB;Adolescent,,,"1 not sharing/ not using,4_not_prerequisites_barriers_facilitators_",,Excluded,Excluded,1

Specialist palliative care leads to better symptom management, but factors contributing to successful symptom management in this context have not been explored. Our aim was to understand what facilitates effective symptom management in specialist palliative care within UK hospices and investigate what barriers are experienced. Methods This was a grounded theory study using qualitative semi-structured focus groups and interviews. Participants were recruited from multidisciplinary specialist palliative care teams (doctors, nurses, healthcare assistants, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, complementary therapists, social workers and chaplains) working in inpatient, outpatient and community services provided by five hospices in the United Kingdom. Results We present a novel qualitative data-derived model of effective symptom management in specialist palliative care. We describe a co-ordinated, multi-faceted, sequential approach involving a process of engagement, partnership, decision-making, and delivery. Interventions to manage symptoms are less effective in psychologically distressed patients. Our data highlights that families of patients have a key role in determining effectiveness of symptom management interventions A holistic approach by a co-ordinated, multi-disciplinary team, including support to recognise and minimise psychological distress might facilitate more effective symptom management. Barriers to symptom management include team discordance and lack of understanding about symptom management by patient and families. Conclusions Shared decision-making between patients and professionals and co-ordination of care by a multi-disciplinary team are key components of effective symptom management. Actions to address psychological distress and evaluate the understanding and expectations of patients and their families would enable more effective symptom management. A more effective multi-disciplinary approach would be facilitated by discussion within teams about role competencies and boundaries.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health",10.1186/s12904-022-00904-9,Palliative Care,,,5_adresses_government_health,,Excluded,Excluded,1

Previous studies, however, have yet to explore if and how a combination of quantitative and qualitative data could facilitate the care team to better understand each resident with dementia in the nursing home context for personalised BPSD management. Guided by a Research through Design approach, a prototype for collecting and visualising the quantitative and qualitative data towards personalised BPSD management was developed together with the care team. Via developing this prototype, knowledge was gained in what types of data could be combined for personalised BPSD management in nursing homes, what are their values, how to collect and present them, and how to introduce them in the working routine of the care team for analysis. The main findings suggest that the types of data to be collected could be unique for each resident with dementia; the quantitative and qualitative data are of value to each other during data collection and analysis; data collection should be quick and standardised yet flexible for the care team; the overview page is vital for data presentation; and user scenarios could be created to nudge the care team to analyse the data at certain points of their working routine.

Individual construct systems are elicited from each group member prior to the group decision using an open-ended sorting procedure (Canter, Brown & Groat, 1985). The combined construct system of the group is represented using a non-metric multidimensional scaling technique known as Multidimensional Scalogram Analysis (MSA). Each stage of the elicitation and representation of the construct systems is illustrated using a worked example taken from an experimental decision-making group choosing houses for student accommodation. The decision reached by the group is compared to the multidimensional model.

Secondary analysis was carried out, of qualitative data collected in two previous studies in North-West England. Older people are reluctant to recognise and name depression as a set of symptoms that legitimises attending their general practitioner (GP). They do not consider themselves candidates for help for their distress. This is partly due to perceptions of the role of the GP but also to previous negative experiences of help seeking. In addition, treatments offered, which are predominantly biomedical, may not be acceptable to older people. Interventions offered to older people need to encourage social engagement, such as befriending, and enhancement of creative, physical and social activity.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",10.1111/j.1365-2524.2011.01015.x,RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL;LATER LIFE;SYMPTOMS;DISTRESS;ILLNESS;ADULTS;HEALTH;NEED;AGE;Primary Health Care,,,"1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",,Excluded,Excluded,1

The rigor and consistency behind the construction of these labels ultimately shape research findings and conclusions. A multifaceted methodological conundrum to address this challenge is the need for human reasoning for classification that leads to deeper and more nuanced understandings; however, this same manual human classification comes with the well-documented increase in classification inconsistencies and errors, particularly when dealing with vast amounts of documents and teams of coders. An alternative to human coding consists of machine learning-assisted techniques. These data science and visualization techniques offer tools for data classification that are cost-effective and consistent but are prone to losing participants' meanings or voices for two main reasons: (a) these classifications typically aggregate all texts configuring each input file (i.e., each interview transcript) into a single topic or code and (b) these words configuring texts are analyzed outside of their original contexts. To address this challenge and analytic conundrum, we present an analytic framework and software tool, that addresses the following question: How to classify vast amounts of qualitative evidence effectively and efficiently without losing context or the original voices of our research participants and while leveraging the nuances that human reasoning bring to the qualitative and mixed methods analytic tables? This framework mirrors the line-by-line coding employed in human/manual code identification but relying on machine learning to classify texts in minutes rather than months. The resulting outputs provide complete transparency of the classification process and aid to recreate the contextualized, original, and unaltered meanings embedded in the input documents, as provided by our participants. We offer access to the database (Gonzalez Canche, 2022e) and software required (Gonzalez Canche, 2022a, Mac , and Windows ) to replicate the analyses. We hope this opportunity to become familiar with the analytic framework and software, may result in expanded access of data science tools to analyze qualitative evidence (see also Gonzalez Canche 2022b, 2022c, 2022d, for related no-code data science applications to classify and analyze qualitative and textual data dynamically).","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using,2 _not_qualitative/_video_data_",10.1177/16094069221144940,Bias (Epidemiology);Software,,,"1 not sharing/ not using,2 _not_qualitative/_video_data_",,Excluded,Excluded,1

Approach: We conducted qualitative analysis of responses to three open-ended questions about WHP program participation, collected as part of an existing WHP program evaluation. Setting: A large mid-western university.        Participants: Of the 20,000 employees emailed an online survey, 3,212 responded (16.1%). The sample was mostly female (75%), white (79%), and comprised of staff members (84%). The average age was 44 years and 67% had annual incomes <$75,001.        Method: We used NVivo-12 Plus and two coders to apply Grounded Theory on the open-ended questions and identify emergent themes.        Results: Although most respondents were happy with the program, differences across wage categories emerged around time, financial incentives, commute, workload, and organizational policies/support Employees at all wage levels were enthusiastic about creating a culture of health but needed different cultural supports to do so. For instance, higher-wage workers needed to overcome self-made time constraints, while lower-wage workers needed supervisor support to overcome coverage constraints that prevented participation.        Conclusion: The unique participation challenges experienced by employees in different wage categories provide justification for WHP programs that can better accommodate the participation barriers of all employees. While some programs may simply require more flexible offerings, supervisors may need to be trained to support and foster healthy environments.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health",10.1177/08901171211069546     EA JAN 2022,WORKSITE;WORKERS;EMPLOYEES;SMOKING;Health Promotion;Workplace;Tocopherols,,,5_adresses_government_health,,Excluded,Excluded,1

BackgroundThe SHARE plus intervention includes continuous glucose monitoring with a data sharing app that allows care partners to view glucose data on a smartphone and receive alerts. People with T1D and their care partners are educated about communication strategies, problem-solving strategies, and action planning when using glucose data sharing. DesignQualitative descriptive design. MethodsOlder adults with T1D wore a continuous glucose monitor for 3 months (n = 10). Care partners (n = 10) used a data-sharing app. The SHARE plus intervention consisted of one 90-min education session. Semi-structured interviews were conducted across 10 dyads (person with diabetes and care partner) following the 12-week study. A qualitative description and a constant comparison approach were used to examine similarities and differences in experiences. Interviews were transcribed, coded, and analysed for common themes. The manuscript adheres to COREQ EQUATOR checklist. ResultsThe SHARE plus intervention increased diabetes knowledge across the dyads, improving confidence and helping partners understand how to navigate symptoms and behaviours and when to intervene. Dyads worked together to optimise diabetes management through improved communication, collaboration, and management of disagreements. Although the majority of persons with diabetes and their care partners reported no conflictual communication, disagreements about diabetes management remained in some dyads. The SHARE plus intervention impacted care partners in various ways from a psychological perspective. While live-in-care partners felt peace of mind, care partners living away from persons with diabetes had some increased worry and concern. ConclusionThe SHARE plus intervention results can help guide future development of diabetes dyadic care and education interventions using diabetes technology. Relevance to Clinical PracticeThe SHARE plus intervention is a brief, practical intervention that can help diabetes clinicians improve communication and collaboration among spouses living with older adults with T1D who use continuous glucose monitoring with data sharing.

Discrimination in various forms was reported, from racially charged threats to subtle microaggressions. Participants experienced profoundly elevated levels of PD, feeling fearful, undermined, and under-confident.

Findings provide evidence for the socialization of family of origin on lifestyle choices into adulthood and also suggest promising changes due to romantic partner.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",10.1097/FCH.0000000000000188,BODY-MASS INDEX;PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY;FAST-FOOD;ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS;UNITED-STATES;HEALTH DISPARITIES;CHILDHOOD OBESITY;EATING REGULATION;YOUNG ADULTHOOD;ADOLESCENTS;Continental Population Groups;Life Style;Statistics as Topic,,,"1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",,Excluded,Excluded,1

Design A qualitative study using semi-structured interviews, thematic analysis and constant-comparison approach.        Participants Eleven healthcare providers and one non-clinical volunteer working in community or hospital-based settings who had experience of migrants accessing NHS England services. Interviews were carried out in 2018.        Setting England.        Results Awareness and understanding of the patient data-sharing agreement varied among participants, who associated this with a perceived lack of transparency by the government. Participants provided insight into how they thought the data-sharing agreement was negatively influencing migrants' health-seeking behaviour, their relationship with clinicians and the safety and quality of their care. They referred to the policy as a challenge to their core ethical principles, explicitly patient confidentiality and trust, which varied depending on their clinical specialty.        Conclusions A perceived lack of transparency during the policy development process can result in suspicion or mistrust towards government among the health workforce, patients and public, which is underpinned by a notion of power or control. The patient data-sharing agreement was considered a threat to some of the core principles of the NHS and its implementation as adversely affecting healthcare access and patient safety. Future policy development should involve a range of stakeholders including civil society, healthcare professionals and ethicists, and include more meaningful assessments of the impact on healthcare and public health.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health",10.1136/bmjopen-2019-033202,UNDOCUMENTED MIGRANTS;NATIVE POPULATION;SERVICES;EXPERIENCES;MIGRATION;England;Information Dissemination;Emigrants and Immigrants,,,5_adresses_government_health,,Excluded,Excluded,1

Current consent models in Quebec were not established with the context of LHSs in mind and do not support the agility and transparency required to obtain consent from all involved, especially the citizens. Therefore, a new approach to consent is needed. Previous work identified the meta-consent model as a promising alternative to fulfill the requirements of LHSs, particularly large-scale deployments. We elicited the public's attitude toward the meta-consent model to evaluate if the model could be understood by the citizens and would be deemed acceptable to prepare for its possible implementation in Quebec. Methods Eight focus groups, with a total of 63 members of the general public from various backgrounds were conducted in Quebec, Canada, in 2019. Explicit attention was given to literacy levels, language spoken at home and rural vs urban settings. We assessed attitudes, concerns and facilitators regarding key components of the meta-consent model: predefined categories to personalized consent requests, a dynamic web-based infrastructure to record meta-consent, and default settings. To analyse the discussions, a thematic content analysis was performed using a qualitative software. Results Our findings showed that participants were supportive of this new approach of consent as it promotes transparency and offers autonomy for the management of their health data. Key facilitators were identified to be considered in the implementation of a meta-consent model in the Quebec LHSs: information and transparency, awareness campaigns, development of educational tools, collaboration of front-line healthcare professionals, default settings deemed acceptable by the society as well as close partnerships with recognized and trusted institutions. Conclusions This qualitative study reveals the openness of a sample of the Quebec population regarding the meta-consent model for secondary use of health data for research. This first exploratory study conducted with the public is an important step in guiding decision-makers in the next phases of implementing the various strategies to support access and use of health data in Quebec.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health",10.1186/s12910-021-00647-x,Learning,,,5_adresses_government_health,,Excluded,Excluded,1

Heterogeneous and voluminous nature of research data created in biomedical laboratories make information management difficult and research unproductive. One such collaborative effort was evaluated over a period of four years using data collection methods including ethnographic observations, semi-structured interviews, web-based surveys, progress reports, conference call summaries, and face-to-face group discussions. Data were analyzed using qualitative methods of data analysis to (1) characterize specific problems faced by biomedical researchers with traditional information management practices, (2) identify intervention areas to introduce a new research information management system called Labmatrix, and finally to (3) evaluate and delineate important general collaboration (intervention) characteristics that can optimize outcomes of an implementation process in biomedical laboratories. Results emphasize the importance of end user perseverance, human-centric interoperability evaluation, and demonstration of return on investment of effort and time of laboratory members and industry personnel for success of implementation process. In addition, there is an intrinsic learning component associated with the implementation process of an information management system. Technology transfer experience in a complex environment such as the biomedical laboratory can be eased with use of information systems that support human and cognitive interoperability. Such informatics features can also contribute to successful collaboration and hopefully to scientific productivity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Participants A total of 138 professionals and 157 people with dementia participated in the programme.        Methods Challenging behaviour in persons with dementia was assessed by professionals using a total Neuropsychiatric Inventory score. Data on expected facilitators and barriers were extracted for qualitative analysis from a debriefing meeting between professionals.        Results Of the 157 persons with dementia, 81 (51.6%) received follow-up behavioural evaluations by March 2019. The average level of challenging behaviour was significantly reduced for 81 persons from baseline to their most recent follow-up evaluations. Facilitators included 'programme available for care managers', 'visualised feedback on professionals' work', 'affordable for providers and professionals' and 'media coverage'.

There was wide variability in the prevalence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and tuberculosis (TB) disease across these communities. We sought to clarify whether specific communities could have been more/less vulnerable to M. tuberculosis transmission as a result of sociological variety relevant to transmission efficiency.        Design We conducted a mixed methods secondary analysis using existing data sets. First, we analysed qualitative data to categorise and synthesise patterns of socio-spatial engagement across communities. Second, we compared emergent sociological variables with a measure of transmission efficiency: the ratio of the annual risk of infection to TB prevalence.        Setting ZAMSTAR communities in urban and peri-urban Zambia, spanning five provinces.        Participants Fifteen communities, each served by a health facility offering TB treatment to a population of at least 25 000. TB notification rates were at least 400 per 100 000 per annum and HIV seroprevalence was estimated to be high.        Results Crowding, movement, livelihoods and participation in recreational activity differed across communities. Based on 12 socio-spatial indicators, communities were qualitatively classified as more/ less spatially crowded and as more/less socially 'open' to contact with others, with implications for the presumptive risk of M. tuberculosis transmission. For example, watching video shows in poorly ventilated structures posed a presumptive risk in more socially open communities, while outdoor farming and/or fishing were particularly widespread in communities with lower transmission measures.        Conclusions A dual dynamic of 'social permeability' and crowding appeared relevant to disparities in M. tuberculosis transmission efficiency. To reduce transmission, certain socio-spatial aspects could be adjusted (eg, increasing ventilation on transport), while more structural aspects are less malleable (eg, reliance on public transport). We recommend integrating community level typologies with genome sequencing techniques to further explore the significance of 'social permeability'.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using",10.1136/bmjopen-2020-047136,SOCIAL CONTACT;PREVALENCE;ZAMSTAR;STIGMA;BURDEN;Tuberculosis,,,1 not sharing/ not using,,Excluded,Excluded,1

There has been little investigation into the experiences and opinions of those staff directly involved in risk management: lead obstetricians and specialist risk midwives, who are ideally placed to identify how current implementation of risk management strategies can be improved.        Methods A qualitative study of consultant-led maternity units in an English region. Semistructured interviews were conducted with the obstetric and midwifery risk management leads for each unit. We explored their approach to risk management, particularly their opinions regarding quality monitoring and related barriers/issues. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and thematically analysed.        Results Twenty-seven staff from 12/15 maternity units participated. Key issues identified included: concern for the accuracy and validity of their local data, potential difficulties related to data collation, the negative impact of external interference by national regulatory bodies on local clinical priorities, the influence of the local culture of the maternity unit on levels of engagement in the risk management process, and scepticism about the value of benchmarking of maternity units without adjustment for population characteristics.        Conclusions Local maternity risk managers may provide valuable, clinically relevant insights into current issues in clinical data monitoring. Improvements should focus on the accuracy and ease of data collation with a need for an agreed maternity indicators set, populated from validated databases, and not reliant on data collection systems that distract clinicians from patient activity and quality improvement. It is clear that working relationships between risk managers, their own clinical teams and external national bodies require improvement and alignment. Further discussion regarding benchmarking between maternity units is required prior to implementation. These findings are likely to be relevant to other clinical specialties.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",10.1136/bmjqs-2013-002025,CARE;Risk Management;Research Design,,,"1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",,Excluded,Excluded,1

Methods: Longitudinal interview data with 117 people with neurological conditions were used to test a preliminary framework derived from the literature. Statements from the interviews were sorted according to the predefined categories of the preliminary framework to investigate the fit between the framework and the qualitative data. Data on frequencies of strategies complemented the qualitative analysis.        Results: The Taxonomy of Every Day Self-management Strategies (TEDSS) Framework includes five Goal-oriented Domains (Internal, Social Interaction, Activities, Health Behaviour and Disease Controlling), and two additional Support-oriented Domains (Process and Resource). The Support-oriented Domain strategies (such as information seeking and health navigation) are not, in and of themselves, goal focused. Instead, they underlie and support the Goal-oriented Domain strategies. Together, the seven domains create a comprehensive and unified framework for understanding how people with neurological conditions self-manage all aspects of everyday life.

The purposes of this manuscript are to describe the use of mapping for qualitative data analysis, provide step-by-step instructions of how to construct mind maps, and present examples specific to qualitative data analysis. An example from a recent study of patient and provider perceptions of virtual visits demonstrates the use of Xmind in conjunction with Atlas.ti for qualitative content analysis of open-ended survey data. While coding in Atlas.ti, we used Xmind to develop dynamic memos, code networks, and themes. The memo map served to identify common coding patterns and informed subsequent coding stages. After coding in Atlas.ti, the entire code list was imported into a new map in Xmind and iteratively organized to identify conceptual groupings, similarities/differences, and key ideas. Themes were identified through pattern coding and refining code networks within the Xmind map. Map iterations formed part of the analytic trail and facilitated peer-to-peer discussions. The final map served as the model for publication. The use of mind mapping enhanced the rigor, credibility, and transparency of analyses and facilitated peer-to-peer communication. This technique can be used to manage diverse content (documents, audio/video file, image, web links, and personal notes) and thus has great potential to contribute to a variety of data management tasks.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",10.1002/nur.21920,TOOL;Software,,,"1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",,Excluded,Excluded,1

Participants recounted their experiences with men's suicide attempts and associated interventions, and suggested ways in which suicide prevention may be improved.        ResultsFive tensions in perspectives emerged between men and their support networks, which complicated effective management of suicide risk: (i) respecting privacy vs monitoring risk, (ii) differentiating normal vs risky behaviour changes, (iii) familiarity vs anonymity in personal information disclosure, (iv) maintaining autonomy vs imposing constraints to limit risk, and (v) perceived need for vs failures of external support services.

Suggested solutions included improving risk communication, reducing reliance on single source supports and increasing intervention flexibility in response to individual needs.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",10.1111/hex.12611,"HELP-SEEKING;RISK-FACTORS;DEPRESSION;PRODROME;ANXIETY;EUROPE;Suicide, Attempted;Suicide",,,"1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",,Excluded,Excluded,1

Empirical evidence is needed to determine if the order of data collection in concurrent mixed methods research biases participants' responses to closed and open-ended questions.        Objectives: To examine the influence of the quantitative-qualitative sequence on responses to closed and open-ended questions when assessing the same variables or aspects of a phenomenon simultaneously within the same study phase.        Design: A descriptive cross-sectional, concurrent mixed-methods design was used to collect quantitative (survey) and qualitative (interview) data. The setting was a large multi-site health care centre in Canada.        Methods: A convenience sample of 50 registered nurses was selected and participated in the study. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two sequences for data collection, quantitative-qualitative or qualitative-quantitative.        Analysis: Independent t-tests were performed to compare the two groups' responses to the survey items. Directed content analysis was used to compare the participants' responses to the interview questions.        Results: The sequence of data collection did not greatly affect the participants' responses to the closed-ended questions (survey items) or the open-ended questions (interview questions).        Conclusions: The sequencing of data collection, when using both survey and semi-structured interviews, may not bias participants' responses to closed or open-ended questions.

Advances in technology allow electronic monitoring of nebuliser usage and feedback of objective adherence data to PWCF and clinical teams caring for them. CFHealthHub is a new intervention that collects and displays objective adherence data in easy-to-read formats with the aim of improving nebuliser adherence and health. There is little understanding of how objective adherence data is perceived by PWCF and healthcare professionals (HCPs). Patients and Methods: A qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with 22 PWCF and 31 HCPs who had used the CFHealthHub intervention. Results: Objective adherence data was welcomed by the majority of PWCF in the sample, and HCP delivering the intervention, because the data allowed PWCF to reflect on patterns of adherence or non-adherence. Ease of use and characteristics of data display were important, particularly the use of a """"traffic light"""" system to allow PWCF to easily see if they were meeting their adherence targets. For PWCF objective adherence data was used as """"proof to self"""", offering reassurance to high adherers, and a wake-up call to those with lower levels of adherence. It could also provide 'proof to others' where PWCF had higher levels of adherence than HCP or family members believed. The data could sometimes change HCP perceptions of PWCF's identities as poor adherers. Where adherence was not high, data was used to facilitate honest discussions between PWCF and HCPs about how to increase adherence. HCPs perceived that it was important to use the data positively to motivate, rather than criticise, PWCF. Conclusion: Objective nebuliser adherence data in CFHealthHub can offer proof of adherence to PWCF and HCPs. It is important to use it constructively to facilitate discussions on how to improve adherence.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",10.2147/PPA.S353434,MEDICATION ADHERENCE;LUNG HEALTH;CARE TEAMS;EXPLORATION;ADOLESCENTS;ADULTS;Cystic Fibrosis,,,"1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",,Excluded,Excluded,1

An assessment was conducted to identify strengths and weaknesses of the health data management and reporting systems that capture and transfer routine monitoring and evaluation (M&E) data in Botswana.        Methods: This was a descriptive, qualitative assessment. In-depth interviews were conducted at the national (n = 27), district (n = 31), and facility/community (n = 71) levels to assess i) M&E structures, functions, and capabilities; ii) indicator definitions and reporting guidelines; iii) data collection forms and tools; iv) data management processes; and v) links with the national reporting system. A framework analysis was conducted using ATLAS.ti v6.1.        Results: Health programs generally had standardized data collection and reporting tools and defined personnel for M&E responsibilities at the national and district levels. Best practices unique to individual health programs were identified and included a variety of relatively low-resource initiatives such as attention to staffing patterns, making health data more accessible for evidence-based decision-making, developing a single source of information related to indicator definitions, data collection tools, and management processes, and utilization of supportive supervision visits to districts and facilities. Weakness included limited ownership of M&E-related duties within facilities, a lack of tertiary training programs to build M&E skills, few standard practices related to confidentiality and document storage, limited dissemination of indicator definitions, and limited functionality of electronic data management systems.        Conclusions: Addressing fundamental M&E system issues, further standardization of M&E practices, and increasing health services management responsiveness to time-sensitive information are critical to sustain progress related to health service delivery in Botswana. In addition to high-resource initiatives, such as investments in electronic medical record systems and tertiary training programs, there are a variety of low-resource initiatives, such as regular data quality checks, that can strengthen national health information systems. Applying best practices that are effective within one health program to data management and reporting systems of other programs is a practical approach for strengthening health informatics and improving data quality.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",10.1186/1478-4505-12-7,PRISM FRAMEWORK;SCALE-UP;HIV;INTERVENTIONS;PROGRAM,,,"1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",,Excluded,Excluded,1

Some are the result of nurses' clinical judgement However, little is known about such practices and their effects on the safety of intravenous infusions. Our objective was to explore ways in which nurses contribute to system-level resilience when administering intravenous infusions.        Methods: We conducted a secondary analysis of qualitative data from debriefs and focus groups from a mixed methods study of errors and policy deviations in intravenous infusion administration across 16 English hospitals. Analysis focused on nurses' contributions to system-level resilience, drawing on Larcos's et al. framework of types of resilience.        Results: Five types of system-level resilience were identified in nurses' behaviour: anticipatory resilience, responsive resilience, resilience based on past experience, workarounds and nurses performing informal 'risk assessments' in relation to how best to treat individual patients. Examples of practices contributing to infusion safety were found for each of these types of resilience.        Conclusion: Our findings suggest nurses are a key source of system-level resilience. Some behaviours that may be considered deviations from policy or best practice are the result of reasoned clinical judgement to improve infusion safety in response to the specific situation at hand. Adaptive behaviour is necessary to cope with the complexity of practice. There is a tension between standardisation and supporting flexibility in safety management. (C) 2019 The Authors.

However, the existing research has not yet established a systematic analytical framework for OGD performance, and the explanation degree of performance differences in OGD implementation is limited. Thus, this study takes technical management capacity, financial resource, organization arrangement, rules and regulations, organization culture, public demand, and inter-government competition as antecedent conditions under the perspective of technology-organization-environment framework and resource-based theory. From the cases of 16 provincial OGD practice in China, we employ fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis to explore the influencing mechanism of the interaction and coordination of multiple conditions on OGD performance. Results indicate that OGD performance depends on the integration of the total effect of various factors. Moreover, four configurational paths could be utilized to achieve high OGD performance, namely, organization-balanced path, organization-environment path, balanced path, and organization-technology path. Furthermore, a substitution relationship exists among different conditional variables, which points out the direction and focus of the implementation of OGD for governments with different endowment characteristics.

Broad consent to such sharing is considered appropriate, feasible and acceptable in low- and middle-income settings, but to date limited empirical research has been conducted to inform the design of such processes. We examined stakeholder perspectives about how best to seek broad consent to sharing data from the Mahidol Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit, which implemented a data sharing policy and broad consent to data sharing in January 2016.MethodsBetween February and August 2017 qualitative data were collected at two sites, Bangkok and the Thai-Myanmar border town of Mae Sot. We conducted eighteen semi-structured interviews. We also conducted four focus group discussions with a total of nineteen people. Descriptive and thematic coding informed analysis of aspects of data sharing that are considered most important to inform participants about, and the best ways to explain complex and abstract topics relating to data sharing.ResultsThe findings demonstrated that clinical trial participants prioritise information about the potential benefits and harms of data sharing. Stakeholders made multiple suggestions for clarifying information provided about data sharing on such topics. There was significant variation amongst stakeholders' perspectives about how much information should be provided about data sharing, and it was clear that effective information provision should be responsive to the study, the study population, the individual research participant and the research context.ConclusionsEffectively communicating about data sharing with research participants is challenging in practice, highlighting the importance of robust and effective data sharing governance in this context. Broad consent should incorporate effective and efficient explanations of data sharing to promote informed decision-making, without impeding research participants' understandings of key aspects of the research from which data will be shared. Further work is required to refine both the development of core information about data sharing to be provided to all research participants, and appropriate solutions for context specific-challenges arising when explaining data sharing.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health",10.1186/s12910-018-0326-x,PLASMODIUM-FALCIPARUM MALARIA;COMMUNITY ADVISORY BOARDS;INFORMED-CONSENT;RESEARCH STAKEHOLDERS;DYNAMIC CONSENT;CLINICAL-TRIALS;VIEWS;PARTICIPANTS;EXPERIENCES;ENGAGEMENT;Thailand;Information Dissemination,,,5_adresses_government_health,,Excluded,Excluded,1

Alongside this there has been growing interest in the public acceptability of data sharing and data linkage practices. Public acceptance is recognised as crucial for ensuring the legitimacy of current practices and systems of governance. Given the growing international interest in this area this systematic review and thematic synthesis represents a timely review of current evidence. It highlights the key factors influencing public responses as well as important areas for further research.        Methods: This paper reports a systematic review and thematic synthesis of qualitative studies examining public attitudes towards the sharing or linkage of health data for research purposes. Twenty-five studies were included in the review. The included studies were conducted primarily in the UK and North America, with one study set in Japan, another in Sweden and one in multiple countries. The included studies were conducted between 1999 and 2013 (eight studies selected for inclusion did not report data collection dates). The qualitative methods represented in the studies included focus groups, interviews, deliberative events, dialogue workshops and asynchronous online interviews.        Results: Key themes identified across the corpus of studies related to the conditions necessary for public support/acceptability, areas of public concern and implications for future research. The results identify a growing body of evidence pointing towards widespread general-though conditional-support for data linkage and data sharing for research purposes. Whilst a variety of concerns were raised (e.g. relating to confidentiality, individuals' control over their data, uses and abuses of data and potential harms arising) in cases where participants perceived there to be actual or potential public benefits from research and had trust in the individuals or organisations conducting and/or overseeing data linkage/sharing, they were generally supportive. The studies also find current low levels of awareness about existing practices and uses of data.        Conclusions: Whilst the results indicate widespread (conditional) public support for data sharing and linkage for research purposes, a range of concerns exist. In order to ensure public support for future research uses of data greater awareness raising combined with opportunities for public engagement and deliberation are needed. This will be essential for ensuring the legitimacy of future health informatics research and avoiding further public controversy.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health",10.1186/s12910-016-0153-x,PRIVACY;CONSENT;INFORMATION;RECORDS;CARE;CONFIDENTIALITY;MORTALITY;ATTITUDES;DISEASE;PEOPLE,,,5_adresses_government_health,,Excluded,Excluded,1

Transition from student to new graduate nurse is challenging and stressful, with health care providers expecting graduates to """"hit the ground running"""". The reality is that most graduates experience role adjustment difficulties and require support from senior colleagues within health care organisations. Drawing on a larger Australian study that examined pre-registration paid employment and its impact on graduate nurse transition, findings in this paper suggest that successful transition is linked to post-registration or employer factors and less so to pre-registration paid employment factors. Utilising interpretive description of two qualitative data sets; three organising themes were identified: a matching skill set, the beginning foundation and a job well done. The global theme, valuing beginning practice describes newly qualified nurse's views on being valued by the nursing profession and how they were accepted into the work environment. Despite the stressors faced by the majority of new graduate nurses adjusting to the rigours of practice, graduate transition can be improved by supportive institutional practices and fostering collegial respect. Successful graduate nurse transition improves job satisfaction and is an effective strategy to address the ongoing pressures of recruitment and retention of new graduates. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We explore and compare the perspectives of researchers, research ethics committees (RECs) and other relevant professionals (e.g. pathologists and clinicians). We focus on points of contention because they demonstrate misalignment between the expectations, values and assumptions of these stakeholders. Methods This is a multi-method study using observational research, focus groups and interviews with 42 participants (conducted 2016-2017) and analyzed using thematic analysis. Results Results are arranged under the following themes: consent; balancing the social value of the research with consent requirements; and harm. Our findings demonstrate different perspectives on the review process, styles of ethical reasoning and issues of concern. First, researchers and RECs disagreed about whether the cost of re-consenting patients satisfied the criterion of impracticability for consent waivers. Second, most researchers were skeptical that secondary research with already collected tissue and data could harm patients. Researchers often pointed to the harm arising from a failure to use existing material for research. RECs were concerned about the potential for secondary research to stigmatize communities. Third, researchers adopted a more consequentialist approach to decision-making, including some willingness to trade off the benefit of the research against the cost of getting consent; whereas RECs were more deontological and typically considered research benefit only after it had been established that re-consent was impractical. Conclusion This research highlights ways in which RECs and researchers may be talking past each other, resulting in confusion and frustration. These finding provide a platform for realignment of the expectations of RECs and researchers, which could contribute to making research ethics review more effective.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health,3 _not_human_observation_response_data",10.1371/journal.pone.0235618,HEALTH-CARE-SYSTEM;MEDICAL-RESEARCH;BIG DATA;BIOBANKING;LEGAL;CHALLENGES;GOVERNANCE;PRIVACY;PATIENT,,,"5_adresses_government_health,3 _not_human_observation_response_data",,Excluded,Excluded,1

In total, 10 open-ended interview questions were used to gather the evidence. The case study design was inductive, yielding rich data from 29 respondents representing 20 different organizations.        Findings        Answers were provided to three interrelated RQs about the use of DA by MA, namely, what are their responsibilities? How does this work support inference, prediction and assurance?

Objective: To (1) identify the benefits and challenges related to RT-CGM data sharing from the patient and care partner perspective and (2) to explore the number and type of individuals who share and follow RT-CGM data. Methods: This qualitative content analysis was conducted by examining publicly available blogs focused on RT-CGM and data sharing. A thematic analysis of blogs and associated comments was conducted. Results: A systematic appraisal of personal blogs examined 39 blogs with 206 corresponding comments. The results of the study provided insight about the benefits and challenges related to individuals with diabetes sharing their RT-CGM data with a care partner(s). The analysis resulted in three themes: (1) RT-CGM data sharing enhances feelings of safety, (2) the need to communicate boundaries to avoid judgment, and (3) choice about sharing and following RT-CGM data. RT-CGM data sharing occurred within dyads (n=46), triads (n=15), and tetrads (n=2). Conclusions: Adults and children with type 1 diabetes and their care partners are empowered by the ability to share and follow RT-CGM data. Our findings suggest that RT-CGM data sharing between an individual with diabetes and their care partner can complicate relationships. Healthcare providers need to engage patients and care partners in discussions about best practices related to RT-CGM sharing and following to avoid frustrations within the relationship.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",10.1089/dia.2017.0285     EA NOV 2017,DIABETES MANAGEMENT;SPOUSAL SUPPORT;OLDER-ADULTS;HEALTH;HYPOGLYCEMIA;INVOLVEMENT;OUTCOMES;IMPACT;Information Dissemination,,,"1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",,Excluded,Excluded,1

The need for data sharing among scholars and researchers was evident, the uptake however is slow due to the benefits and detriments of the practices. This paper explores the perceptions of Nigerian academics towards research data sharing practices. Participants from five universities in Nigeria were purposively sampled. Data were gathered through interviews with 22 participants. Their perception towards data sharing was reflected through their awareness, understanding and familiarity of the practice. Most of the participants perceived that data sharing would add value to their professional reputation and fast-track their research progression, however a few of them perceived data sharing as disquieting. The academics labelled data privacy and cultural orientation to be those risks associated with data sharing. The study provides deeper understanding of data sharing and the opportunity for academics to know diverse insights of data sharing practices that would guide scholars in intensifying a variety of data management services, which then can be personalized to their exclusive needs. Further investigation could be done through quantitative research approach to inform data sharing behavior in a larger scale in order to improve the current practices.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 _not_qualitative/_video_data_",10.22452/mjlis.vol25no3.7,INFORMATION;CHALLENGES;COMMUNITY;SCIENCES;BARRIERS;BEHAVIOR;Information Dissemination,,,2 _not_qualitative/_video_data_,,Excluded,Excluded,1

Objective We explored perspectives of pwMS regarding the modification of lifestyle-related risk factors in multiple sclerosis (MS) for disease management to understand attitudes to and experiences of lifestyle modification as part of self-management from a patient perspective. Design Participants were >= 18 years and English speaking who responded to a free-text open-ended question in the Health Outcomes and Lifestyle In a Sample of pwMS (HOLISM), an international online survey. Responses were analysed utilizing inductive thematic analysis. Results Under the exploration of lifestyle modification, themes describing the experiences and attitudes of participants included practical challenges and physical and psychological barriers, enablers of change and experienced outcomes. Although participants reported some practical and psychological challenges to adoption and maintenance of lifestyle behaviours, many expressed an ability to gain control of MS through engagement with lifestyle behaviours and the development of hope and optimism that accompanied this sense of control, at times leading to a sense of personal transformation. Conclusion Findings highlight the challenges experienced by pwMS in adopting lifestyle modifications for disease management as well as the positive benefits from following healthy lifestyle behaviours. Our findings may form the basis of more focussed qualitative explorations of the experiences and outcomes of lifestyle modification in MS in the future.

Methods Veterans receiving primary care from primarily rural VA community-based outpatient clinics were enrolled. Veterans not engaged in MH treatment screening positive for >= 1 MH problem(s) were randomized to receive veteran peer-delivered feedback on MH screen results and referrals plus 4 sessions of telephone motivational coaching (intervention) versus veteran peer-delivered MH results and referrals without motivational coaching (control). Blinded telephone assessments were conducted at baseline, 8, 16, and 32 weeks. Cox proportional hazard models compared MH clinician-directed treatment initiation between groups; descriptive analyses compared MH treatment retention, changes in MH symptoms, quality of life, and self-care.        Findings Among 272 veterans screening positive for >= 1 MH problem(s), 45% who received veteran peer telephone motivational coaching versus 46% of control participants initiated MH treatment (primary outcome) (hazard ratio: 1.09, 95% CI: 0.76-1.57), representing no between-group differences. In contrast, veterans receiving veteran peer motivational coaching achieved significantly greater improvements in depression, posttraumatic stress disorder and cannabis use scores, quality of life domains, and adoption of some self-care strategies than controls (secondary outcomes). Qualitative data revealed that veterans who received veteran peer motivational coaching may no longer have perceived a need for MH treatment.        Conclusions Among veterans with MH problems using predominantly rural VA community clinics, telephone peer motivational coaching did not enhance MH treatment engagement, but instead had positive effects on MH symptoms, quality of life indicators, and use of self-care strategies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",10.1111/jrh.12582     EA MAY 2021,PSYCHOMETRIC PROPERTIES;OF-LIFE;CARE;INTERVENTION;AFGHANISTAN;BARRIERS;ALCOHOL;PTSD;IRAQ;PSYCHOTHERAPY;Veterans,,,"1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",,Excluded,Excluded,1

Nonetheless, in the wake of public and policy concerns about security and inappropriate use of data, conventional approaches toward data governance may no longer be sufficient to respect and protect individual privacy. One proposed solution to improve transparency and public trust is known as Dynamic Consent, which uses information technology to facilitate a more explicit and accessible opportunity to opt out. In this case, patients can tailor preferences about whom they share their data with and can change their preferences reliably at any time. Furthermore, electronic systems provide opportunities for informing patients about data recipients and the results of research to which their data have contributed.        Objective: To explore patient perspectives on the use of anonymized health care data for research purposes. To evaluate patient perceptions of a Dynamic Consent model and electronic system to enable and implement ongoing communication and collaboration between patients and researchers.        Methods: A total of 26 qualitative interviews and three focus groups were conducted that included a video presentation explaining the reuse of anonymized electronic patient records for research. Slides and tablet devices were used to introduce the Dynamic Consent system for discussion. A total of 35 patients with chronic rheumatic disease with varying levels of illness and social deprivation were recruited from a rheumatology outpatient clinic; 5 participants were recruited from a patient and public involvement health research network.        Results: Patients were supportive of sharing their anonymized electronic patient record for research, but noted a lack of transparency and awareness around the use of data, making it difficult to secure public trust. While there were general concerns about detrimental consequences of data falling into the wrong hands, such as insurance companies, 39 out of 40 (98%) participants generally considered that the altruistic benefits of sharing health care data outweighed the risks. Views were mostly positive about the use of an electronic interface to enable greater control over consent choices, although some patients were happy to share their data without further engagement. Participants were particularly enthusiastic about the system as a means of enabling feedback regarding data recipients and associated research results, noting that this would improve trust and public engagement in research. This underlines the importance of patient and public involvement and engagement throughout the research process, including the reuse of anonymized health care data for research. More than half of patients found the touch screen interface easy to use, although a significant minority, especially those with limited access to technology, expressed some trepidation and felt they may need support to use the system.        Conclusions: Patients from a range of socioeconomic backgrounds viewed a digital system for Dynamic Consent positively, in particular, feedback about data recipients and research results. Implementation of a digital Dynamic Consent system would require careful interface design and would need to be located within a robust data infrastructure; it has the potential to improve trust and engagement in electronic medical record research.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health",10.2196/jmir.5011,PUBLIC-ATTITUDES;RECORDS;TRUST;INFORMATION;AWARENESS;ADOPTION;PEOPLE;Feedback,,,5_adresses_government_health,,Excluded,Excluded,1

Design: Mixed methods secondary analysis of qualitative and quantitative data from the Irish National Maternity Experience Survey 2020.Setting: All 19 maternity hospitals and units in the Republic of Ireland and the national home births service. Women were asked about their maternity care experiences, including antenatal care, care during labour and birth, feeding, and care at home after birth. Participants: A total of 3,205 women who gave birth in October or November 2019 participated in the study (50% response rate). Measurements: Free-text comments related to women's experiences of initiating and continuing breast or formula feeding were analysed using thematic analysis. Quantitative data were described using means (SD) and frequencies and percentages.Findings: In the first few days after birth, 41.9% of women breastfed exclusively, 29.0% used formula and breast milk, and 29.1% bottle-fed only. Seven-hundred and twenty women (22.5%) made 824 comments related to feeding. Four themes were identified: (1) support and encouragement from healthcare professionals, (2) information and advice regarding feeding, (3) Pressure to feed in a particular way and (lack of) respect for personal preferences, and (4) hospital environment and resources.Key conclusions: Some women experienced a lack of support with feeding their babies, regardless of feeding method. Clear and concise information on feeding practices and home supports could help to support mothers with breast or formula feeding.Implications for practice: It is important that healthcare professionals provide evidence-based information and support, while respecting women's choices.

Findings - Based on the sample, the findings suggest that the majority of faculty and students in social science research do not share their data because many of them are unaware of the benefits and methods of doing so. Additional findings regarding social scientists' data-sharing behaviors include: (1) those who do share qualitative data in data repositories are more likely to share their research tools than their raw data; and (2) perceived technical support and extrinsic motivation are both strong predictors of qualitative data sharing (a previously underresearched subtype of social science data sharing).

When the National Health Service proposes to scrape general practitioner records, it is very important that we understand these concerns in some depth.        Objective: This study aims to investigate views of mental health service users on acceptable data sharing to provide clear recommendations for future data sharing systems.        Methods: A total of 4 focus groups with 4 member-checking groups were conducted via the internet between October 2020 and March 2021, with a total of 22 service users in the United Kingdom. Thematic analysis was used to identify the themes.        Results: Six main themes, with several subthemes were identified, such as the purpose of data sharing-for profit, public good, and continuation of care; discrimination through the misattribution of physical symptoms to mental health conditions (ie, diagnostic overshadowing) alongside the discrimination of individuals or groups within society (ie, institutional discrimination); safeguarding data by preserving anonymity and confidentiality, strengthening security measures, and holding organizations accountable; data accuracy and informed consent-increasing transparency about data use and choice; and incorporating service user involvement in system governance to provide insight and increase security.        Conclusions: This study extends the limited research on the views and concerns of mental health service users regarding acceptable data sharing. If adopted, the recommendations should improve the confidence of service users in sharing their data. The five recommendations include screening to ensure that data sharing benefits the public, providing service users with information about how their data are shared and what for, highlighting the existing safeguarding procedures, incorporating service user involvement, and developing tailored training for health care professionals to address issues of diagnostic overshadowing and inaccurate health records. Adopting such systems would aid in data sharing for legitimate interests that will benefit patients and the National Health Service.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health",10.2196/30596,EXPERIENCES;CARE;TECHNOLOGY;EPILEPSY;PATIENT;PEOPLE;VIEWS;Mental Health Services;Information Dissemination;Focus Groups,,,5_adresses_government_health,,Excluded,Excluded,1

The research methodology we adopt is grounded theory: we develop a reflection guide based on research questions covering the impact and challenges of a data-driven culture on business, and the impact on performance management and the decision-making process. The results obtained from senior executives from 21 Romanian companies leads to a conceptual model that distils the major areas arising from the responses and the interrelationships between them. These reveal several key areas of managerial relevance and suggest fruitful action. In particular, we find that the most critical areas requiring intervention lie in the area of awareness and understanding, goal setting, assessing benefits and limitations, learning to trust data, and commitment to an embedded data-driven culture. In addition to changes within organizations themselves, there are also implications for other stakeholders, such as education providers.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",10.3390/su11030684,"",,,"1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",,Excluded,Excluded,1

Design/methodology/approach - The participant observer method was used to collect experiential evidence while applying the tools to a collection of text-, image-, and video-based digital cultural records.        Findings - TAMS Analyzer was found to be a low barrier to entry tool for those with coding and qualitative data analysis experience. Those with general experience will be able to create datasets with the support of manuals and tutorials, while those with limited experience may find it difficult to use. Viewshare was found to be a low barrier to entry tool for sharing data online, and accessible for all skill levels.        Research limitations/implications - TAMS Analyzer supports Mac and Linux platforms only, so a low-cost software recommendation was made for those in Windows environments.        Practical implications - Librarians can use these tools to address data access gaps while promoting library digital collections.        Social implications - With a greater understanding of data tools, librarians can be advisors, collaborators, agents for data culture, and relevant participants in digital humanities scholarship.        Originality/value - The research evaluates both the capabilities of the tools and the barriers to using or accessing them, which are often neglected.

In this fourth article in a series on district decision-making for health, we assessed the extent of maternal, newborn and child health (MNCH)-related data sharing between the private and public sectors in two districts of Uttar Pradesh, India; analysed barriers to data sharing; and identified key inputs required for data sharing. Between March 2013 and August 2014, we conducted 74 key informant interviews at national, state and district levels. Respondents were stakeholders from national, state and district health departments, professional associations, non-governmental programmes and private commercial health facilities with 3-200 beds. Qualitative data were analysed using a framework based on a priori and emerging themes. Private facilities registered for ultrasounds and abortions submitted standardized records on these services, which is compulsory under Indian laws. Data sharing for other services was weak, but most facilities maintained basic records related to institutional deliveries and newborns. Public health facilities in blocks collected these data from a few private facilities using different methods. The major barriers to data sharing included the public sector's non-standardized data collection and utilization systems for MNCH and lack of communication and follow up with private facilities. Private facilities feared information disclosure and the additional burden of reporting, but were willing to share data if asked officially, provided the process was simple and they were assured of confidentiality. Unregistered facilities, managed by providers without a biomedical qualification, also conducted institutional deliveries, but were outside any reporting loops. Our findings suggest that even without legislation, the public sector could set up an effective MNCH data sharing strategy with private registered facilities by developing a standardized and simple system with consistent communication and follow up.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health",10.1093/heapol/czv117,INFORMATION;KNOWLEDGE;PROVIDERS;SAFE;Decision Making;India,,,5_adresses_government_health,,Excluded,Excluded,1

Background Electronic data are increasingly used to monitor protocol compliance but little is known about the impact on nurses' practice in hospital wards. Method Seventeen acute hospital nursing staff participated in semi-structured interviews about compliance with an early warning score (EWS) protocol delivered by a bedside electronic handheld device. Results Before electronic EWS data was used to monitor compliance, staff combined protocol-led actions with clinical judgement. However, some observations were missed to reduce noise and disruption at night. After compliance monitoring was introduced, observations were sometimes covertly omitted using a loophole. Interviewees described a loss of autonomy but acknowledged the EWS system sometimes flagged unexpected patient deterioration. Conclusions Introducing automated electronic systems to support nursing tasks can decrease nursing burden but remove the ability to record legitimate reasons for missing observations. This can result in covert resistance that could reduce patient safety. Implications for nursing management Providing the ability to log legitimate reasons for missing observations would allow nurses to balance professional judgement with the use of electronic data in performance management of protocol compliance.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",10.1111/jonm.12858     EA OCT 2019,EARLY WARNING SCORE;VITAL SIGNS;PATTERNS;CARE;Nursing Assessment,,,"1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",,Excluded,Excluded,1

Understanding the experiences of delivering and receiving palliative care from different perspectives can provide insight into the mechanisms of successful palliative care integration. There is limited research that explores multi-perspective and longitudinal experiences with palliative care provision. This study aimed to explore the longitudinal experiences of patients with heart failure, family carers, and health professionals with palliative care services.MethodsA secondary analysis of 20 qualitative three-month apart interviews with patients with heart failure and family carers recruited from three community palliative care services in the UK. In addition, four group interviews with health professionals from four different services were analysed. Data were analysed using 'reflexive thematic' analysis. Results were explored through the lens of Normalisation Process Theory.ResultsFour themes were generated: Impact of heart failure, Coping and support, Recognising palliative phase, and Coordination of care. The impact of heart failure on patients and families was evident in several dimensions: physical, psychological, social, and financial. Patients developed different coping strategies and received most support from their families. Although health professionals endeavoured to support the patients and families, this was sometimes lacking. Health professionals found it difficult to recognise the palliative phase and when to initiate palliative care conversations. In turn, patients and family carers asked for better communication, collaboration, and care coordination along the whole disease trajectory.ConclusionsThe study provided broad insight into the experiences of patients, family carers, and health professionals with palliative care. It showed the impact of heart failure on patients and their families, how they cope, and how they could be supported to address their palliative care needs. The study findings can help researchers and healthcare professionals to design palliative care interventions focusing on the perceived care needs of patients and families.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health",10.1186/s12904-023-01241-1,QUALITATIVE META-SYNTHESIS;TASK-FORCE;ASSOCIATION;PEOPLE;NEEDS;INTERVENTIONS;CAREGIVERS;STATEMENT;OUTCOMES;CANCER;H-Reflex;Palliative Care,,,5_adresses_government_health,,Excluded,Excluded,1

In the literature, the investigation of open research data practices covers the whole range of big empirical studies covering multiple scientific domains to smaller, in depth studies analysing a single field of research. Despite the richness of literature on this topic, there is still a lack of knowledge on the (open) research data awareness and practices in materials science and engineering. While most current studies focus only on some aspects of open research data practices, we aim for a comprehensive understanding of all practices with respect to the considered scientific domain. Hence this study aims at 1) drawing the whole picture of search, reuse and sharing of research data 2) while focusing on materials science and engineering. The chosen approach allows to explore the connections between different aspects of open research data practices, e.g. between data sharing and data search. In depth interviews with 13 researchers in this field were conducted, transcribed verbatim, coded and analysed using content analysis. The main findings characterised research data in materials science and engineering as extremely diverse, often generated for a very specific research focus and needing a precise description of the data and the complete generation process for possible reuse. Results on research data search and reuse showed that the interviewees intended to reuse data but were mostly unfamiliar with (yet interested in) modern methods as dataset search engines, data journals or searching public repositories. Current research data sharing is not open, but bilaterally and usually encouraged by supervisors or employers. Project funding does affect data sharing in two ways: some researchers argue to share their data openly due to their funding agency's policy, while others face legal restrictions for sharing as their projects are partly funded by industry. The time needed for a precise description of the data and their generation process is named as biggest obstacle for data sharing. From these findings, a precise set of actions is derived suitable to support Open Data, involving training for researchers and introducing rewards for data sharing on the level of universities and funding bodies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using,3 _not_human_observation_response_data",10.1371/journal.pone.0239216,"",,,"1 not sharing/ not using,3 _not_human_observation_response_data",,Excluded,Excluded,1

Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted among 40 participants (19 male and 21 female) aged between 67 and 92 years, between December 2013 and April 2014 attending the Seniorenuniversitat Zurich, Switzerland. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and anonymized. For the analysis of the interviews, an initial coding scheme was developed, refined over time, and applied afterwards to all interviews. Results: The majority of participants were in favor of placing genetic data to research's disposal. Participant's motivations to share data were mainly driven by altruistic reasons and by contributing to the greater good. Furthermore, several factors which might impact the willingness to share data such as sharing data with private companies, generational differences, differences between sharing genetic data or health data, and sharing due to financial incentives were highlighted. Last, some participants indicated concerns regarding data sharing such as misuse of data, the fear of becoming a transparent citizen, and data safety. However, 20% of the participants express confidence in data protection. Even participants who were skeptical in the beginning of the interviews admitted the benefits of data sharing. Discussion: Overall, this study suggests older citizens are willing to share their data for research purposes. However, most of them will only contribute if their data is appropriately protected and if they trust the research institution to use the shared data responsibly. More transparency and detailed information regarding the data usage are urgently needed. There is a great need to increase the engagement of older adults in research since they present a large segment of our society-one which is often underexamined in research. Conclusion: Increased focus on general public engagement, especially of older adults, in scientific research activities known as """"citizen science"""" is needed to further strengthen the uptake of personalized medicine.

Parents of early adolescents (11-13 years) reported making extensive use of """"real time"""" data to remotely manage their child's diabetes and early adolescents described needing and wanting this input. Parents of middle adolescents (14-16 years) described making greater use of retrospective data. To avoid conflict and encourage and support their son/daughter's autonomy, these individuals reported practicing watchful waiting and only intervening after concerns about a pattern of problematic behavior or their child's safety arose. Middle adolescents indicated that data sharing had been done primarily for the benefit of their parents, although they also noted quality of life benefits for themselves. Among late adolescents (17+ years), parents were simply remote because their son/daughter had not permitted access to their data. Participants recommended clear ground rules be put in place about when, and how, data sharing should be used.        Conclusions: To help parent-child dyads use data sharing in ways which minimize conflict and optimize constructive parental support, we recommend tailored input and support, which takes account of family dynamics, the young person's developmental maturity, and the different ways in which data are used across the adolescent age range.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 _not_qualitative/_video_data_,4_not_prerequisites_barriers_facilitators_",10.1089/dia.2020.0637     EA APR 2021,TYPE-1;MANAGEMENT;ADHERENCE;Information Dissemination;Adolescent,,,"2 _not_qualitative/_video_data_,4_not_prerequisites_barriers_facilitators_",,Excluded,Excluded,1

The Michigan Child Care Related Infections Surveillance Program (MCRISP) is a novel online illness surveillance network used by community childcare centers to track disease incidence. It has been used to warn local public health departments about emerging outbreaks. The flow of data from MCRISP, however, remains largely unidirectional-from data reporter to public health researchers. With the intent to ultimately improve the system for users, we wanted to better understand how community illness data collected by MCRISP might best benefit childcare stakeholders themselves. Using a ground-up design approach, we conducted a series of focus groups among childcare directors participating in MCRISP. All primary data reporters from each of the 30 MCRISP-affiliated childcare centers were eligible to participate in the focus groups. A thematic assessment from the focus groups revealed that participants wanted surveillance system improvements that would (1) support subjective experiences with objective data, (2) assist with program decision making, (3) provide educational resources, and (4) prioritize the user's experience. Our findings support a framework by which community disease surveillance networks can move toward greater transparency and 2-way data flow. Ultimately, a more mutually beneficial surveillance system improves stakeholder engagement, provides opportunities for rapid mitigation strategies, and can help allocate timely resources in responding to emerging outbreaks and pandemics.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health",10.1089/hs.2020.0069     EA MAY 2021,TRANSMISSION;FACILITIES;DISEASES;SYSTEM;UTAH;Information Dissemination,,,5_adresses_government_health,,Excluded,Excluded,1

After the addition of a physical therapy (PT) cohort to an existing interprofessional ISL, survey data was collected for program evaluation. Responses indicated altered ideation regarding the role of PT in pain management, and this theme was investigated further. Following two one-week interprofessional ISL experiences in Honduras in 2015 (Y1) and 2016 (Y2), participating students and preceptors in pharmacy, physician assistant and osteopathic medicine and Y1 PT preceptors were surveyed regarding their impressions of the PT cohort and the PT profession in general. Researchers performed thematic analysis to identify trends in responses, yielding three themes regarding PT's role in pain management: Patient Empowerment (46.2%), Management of Musculoskeletal Pain (42.3%), and Alternatives to Pharmacological Pain Management (11.5%). Results suggest that participating in an interprofessional ISL experience with a PT cohort encourages consideration of non-pharmacological methods to treat pain, including referral to PT to address musculoskeletal pain, and empowering patients to prevent or self-manage pain.

One technique to qualify the degree of data economization is that constructed by Boisot. Boisot's Information Space (I-Space) takes into account the degree to which data are written (codification), the degree to which the data can be understood (abstraction), and the degree to which the data are effectively communicated to an audience (diffusion). A data system is said to be more data economical if it is relatively high in these dimensions. Application of the approach to entries in two popular, publicly available biological data repositories, the Protein DataBank (PDB) and GenBank, leads to the recommendation that PDB increases its level of abstraction through establishing a larger set of detailed keywords, diffusion through constructing hyperlinks to other databases, and codification through constructing additional subsections. With these recommendations in place, PDB would achieve the greater data economies currently enjoyed by GenBank. A discussion of the limitations of the approach is presented.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using",10.1002/asi.20270,"Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Genome, Human;Genome",,,1 not sharing/ not using,,Excluded,Excluded,1

Although HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection, public awareness of this is poor. In addition, many clinicians lack adequate knowledge or confidence to discuss sexual transmission and related sensitive issues. Complex science needs to be communicated in a clear, digestible, honest and salient way. Therefore, the aim of this study was to coproduce with patients who have cancer appropriate resources to guide these highly sensitive and difficult consultations.        Methods A matrix of evidence developed from a variety of sources, including a systematic review and telephone interviews with clinicians, supported the production of a draft list of approximately 100 potential educational messages. These were refined in face-to-face patient interviews using card-sorting techniques, and tested in cognitive debrief interviews to produce a (a) over cap (sic) fast and frugal (a) over cap (sic)(TM) knowledge tool.        Results We developed three versions of a consultation guide, each comprising a clinician guidance sheet and patient information leaflet for gynaecological (cervical, vaginal, vulvar), anal or oropharyngeal cancers. That cancer could be caused by a sexually transmitted virus acquired many years previously was surprising to many and shocking to a few patients. However, they found the information clear, helpful and reassuring. Clinicians acknowledged a lack of confidence in explaining HPV, welcomed the clinician guidance sheets and considered printed information for patients particularly useful.        Conclusion Because of the (a) over cap (sic) shock factor (a) over cap (sic)(TM), clinicians will need to approach the discussion of HPV with sensitivity and take individual needs and preferences into account, but we provide a novel, rigorously developed and tested resource which should have broad applicability in the UK National Health Service and other health systems.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",10.1136/bmjopen-2016-015413,NECK-CANCER;HPV;PREVALENCE;WOMEN;HEAD;INFECTION;DIAGNOSIS;EMOTIONS;PARENTS;PATIENT;Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Referral and Consultation,,,"1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",,Excluded,Excluded,1

Aim: Experiences and views of informal carers and healthcare professionals regarding the transition from people with dementia to a nursing home are investigated to improve the support for informal carers.        Method: This secondary analysis included data from all five focus groups with n = 30 informal carers and healthcare professionals conducted as part of the """"RightTimePlaceCare"""" project. To supplement the material which resulted from a single interview question, a literature analysis with the same focus was conducted.        Results: The merged results indicated that informal carers needed professional support early on at home until after the nursing home placement. Concerns regarding nursing homes, financial aspects and family related issues were important aspects in the decision making. Healthcare professionals recommended provision of early guidance regarding those matters and making own experiences with nursing homes. Healthcare professionals should serve as mediators during the transition process and improve the collaboration between service providers.        Conclusions: Empowering families to make informed choices could be facilitated by offering advice at home about their options for formal support services, financial support, and housing solutions.

These teams are composed of school leaders and teachers, who work together to improve the quality of education. They collaboratively create knowledge related to data use and to an educational problem they are studying. The paper aims to discuss these issues.        Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative micro-process case study was conducted for two data teams. The modes, transitions and content of the knowledge creation process were analyzed for all data team meetings over a two-year period. In addition, all team members were interviewed twice to triangulate the findings.        Findings - Results show that the knowledge creation process was cyclical across meetings, but more iterative within meetings. Furthermore, engagement in the socialization and internalization mode provided added value in this process. Finally, the SECI model clearly differentiated between team members' processes. Team members who engaged more often in the socialization and internalization modes and displayed more personal engagement in those modes gained greater and deeper knowledge.        Research limitations/implications - The SECI model is valuable for understanding how teams gain new knowledge and why they differ in those gains.        Practical implications - Stimulation of active personal engagement in the socialization and internalization mode is needed.        Originality/value - This is one of the first attempts to concretely observe the process of knowledge creation. It provides essential insights into what educators do in professional development contexts, and how support can best be provided.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using",10.1108/JPCC-07-2015-0003,IMPACT;African Continental Ancestry Group,,,1 not sharing/ not using,,Excluded,Excluded,1

Engaging in these self-care behaviors is conducive to gaining knowledge of health status. Even so, knowledge of the self may be insufficient in making sense of chronic conditions. In constructing a new normal after health-related life disruptions, people often turn to peers (others facing similar health issues) and share personal health information with each other. Although health information-sharing behavior is well-documented, it remains underexplored what attitudes individuals with chronic conditions, such as CVD, have toward disclosing personal health data to peers and exploring those of others with similar conditions. We surveyed 39 people who reported being diagnosed with CVD to understand how they conceptualize sharing personal health data with their peers. By analyzing qualitative survey data thematically, we found that respondents expressed themselves as uncertain about the benefits of interacting with peers in such a manner. At the same time, they recognized an opportunity to learn new ideas to enhance CVD self-care in mutual data sharing. We also report participants' analytical orientation toward this sort of data sharing herein and elaborate on what sharing a range of personal health data could mean. In light of the existing literature, this study unpacks the notion of sharing in a different population/pathology and with more nuance, particularly by distinguishing between disclosing one's data and exploring others'.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health",10.3390/ijerph19159508,SELF;INFORMATION;SENSE;MODEL;Cardiovascular Diseases,,,5_adresses_government_health,,Excluded,Excluded,1

Participants were aware of the inherent risks associated with data sharing for research. Participants expressed conditional support for data sharing, including genomic sequence data and information contained within electronic medical records. This support included sharing data with researchers from universities and healthcare institutions, both in Singapore and overseas. Support was conditional on the perceived social value of the research and appropriate de-identification and data security processes. Participants suggested that a data sharing oversight body would help strengthen public trust and comfort in data research for PM in Singapore. Conclusion Maintenance of public trust in data security systems and governance regimes can enhance participation in PM and data sharing for research. Contrary to themes in much prior research, participants demonstrated a sophisticated understanding of the inherent risks of data sharing, analysed trade-offs between risks and potential benefits of PM, and often adopted an international perspective.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health",10.1186/s12910-020-00561-8,BIG DATA;CONSENT;GENOMICS;WILLINGNESS;PREFERENCES;ATTITUDES;SAMPLES;Singapore,,,5_adresses_government_health,,Excluded,Excluded,1

There are few published examples demonstrating how this can be achieved.        Aims: This methodological article provides a worked example of research methodology that achieved clarification of authentic early experiences (AEEs) through a bi-directional approach to theory and data.        Methods: Bi-directional refers to our simultaneous use of theory to guide and interrogate empirical data and the use of empirical data to refine theory. We explain the five steps of our methodological approach: (1) understanding the context; (2) critique on existing applications of socio-cultural models to inform study design; (3) data generation; (4) analysis and interpretation and (5) theoretical development through a novel application of Metis.        Results: These steps resulted in understanding of how and why different outcomes arose from students participating in AEE. Our approach offers a mechanism for clarification without which evidence-based effective ways to maximise constructive learning cannot be developed. In our example it also contributed to greater theoretical understanding of the influence of social interactions.        Conclusion: By sharing this example of research undertaken to develop both theory and educational practice we hope to assist others seeking to conduct similar research.,"RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health",10.3109/0142159X.2012.733045,INTERPRETATIVE PHENOMENOLOGICAL ANALYSIS;MEDICAL-EDUCATION;HEALTH;EXPERIENCE;IDENTITY;SCIENCE;ETHICS;VIEWS,,,5_adresses_government_health,,Excluded,Excluded,1

The apparent phenomenon of an increasing divergence of the population into extremes of multi-earner and no-earner households is typically demonstrated using secondary data sources. Consequently, polarization is explained in terms of household employment with regard to earners in a way which overlooks sources of division which emanate from within a variety of household structures. It is posited that the appearance of a polarization of household prospects is manifested, at least in part, by the conflation of social and demographic regional profiles, which combines the observation of two discrete causal mechanisms into one. To illustrate this point, data is presented h-om the 1991 Census of Population Sample of Anonymized Records (SARs) which identifies a pattern of disaggregated household employment compositions (by gender and hours worked) for a specific population of 'nuclear family' households. It is suggested that once the regional effects of flexible employment practices and sectoral restructuring are viewed through the lens of detailed household gender divisions of labour, beyond a one-earner versus multi-earner division, to focus on who is earning, how securely and with what effect on household practices, then questions can be asked about the social implications of global economic restructuring.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: _before 2000",10.1080/00343409750132306,SOCIAL POLARIZATION;GENTRIFICATION;MIGRATION;GENDER;UK;Statistics as Topic,,,_before 2000,,Excluded,Excluded,1

Likewise, in the quantitative section, the reliability of the recommended framework was measured through carrying out a survey. Finally, the framework for data reuse was presented in five dimensions, namely human, organizational, policies and laws, technical, implementation and analysis. Findings Through structural equation modeling, the fitness of the framework was confirmed, and it was found out that the dimensions of policies, human and organizational played more prominent roles in the explanation of the framework in comparison with the other two dimensions. Originality/value Research studies in the area of data reuse have been conducted either quantitatively or qualitatively and in most of them interviews or questionnaires were used as tools for collecting data; however, due to the nature of this area and its relatively new literature in Iran, it is necessary to use mixed methods in order to be able to arrive at a proper understanding of this concept using both quantitative and qualitative approaches.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 _not_qualitative/_video_data_,4_not_prerequisites_barriers_facilitators_",10.1108/LHT-01-2021-0007     EA JUL 2021,QUALITATIVE DATA;ATTITUDINAL BELIEFS;BEHAVIORS;NORMS;Developing Countries;Developed Countries;Program Development,,,"2 _not_qualitative/_video_data_,4_not_prerequisites_barriers_facilitators_",,Excluded,Excluded,1

Informed consent has been proposed as the optimal method for ensuring the ethical entry of patients into clinical trials. However, it is known that problems with informed consent exist from the perspective of both patients and physicians. This has led to the suggestion that a third party, such as a research nurse or data manager, should be responsible for obtaining informed consent. The objective of this study was to explore the views of data managers concerning the nature, challenges, and rewards of their role and the similarities and differences between their role and that of physicians in obtaining informed consent.        METHODS. Four focus groups in three large teaching hospitals were conducted. Twenty-one data managers who were involved in cancer or pain clinical trials participated. The focus groups were audiotaped, transcribed, and subjected to content analysis to identify themes.        RESULTS. Data managers identified three primary roles complementary to that of physicians: information provision, quality assurance of the informed consent process, and ongoing support during the trial. Despite expressed concern that medical and drug company interests may lead to subtle coercion of the patient, participants did not support the notion that they may be solely responsible for the consent process. Participants described a range of ethical dilemmas they confronted, including patients asking them for medical details they could not provide and situations in which they felt that informed consent was compromised in some way, for example, dealing with situations in which the patient appeared to be entering the trial for the wrong reasons due to misunderstanding, need, or passivity. Effective functioning of the multidisciplinary team assisted data managers in performing their role. A range of training needs were identified, particularly communication skills training and trial start-up briefing.        CONCLUSIONS. The issues raised by these data managers have important implications for the successful conduct of clinical trials, particularly the need for an integrated, multidisciplinary approach at all levels of the informed-consent process.

Objectives: To explore how Swiss families interact with health care professionals and right-to-die associations regarding assisted suicide and their choices around disclosure. Methods: A secondary data analysis on a cross-sectional qualitative interview study conducted in the Italian- and French-speaking parts of Switzerland was conducted. Interviews with 28 bereaved family members were analyzed using framework analysis. Results: Two main themes were identified: (1) Interactions with physicians and right-to-die associations. (2) Choices about disclosing their experiences. In general, families believed that assisted suicide is a private matter, to be pursued mainly outside the medical field and involved physicians only when necessary. Families appeared to deliberately limit interaction with physicians and to be more comfortable interacting with the right-to-die associations. Some participants presumed a clear choice between assisted suicide or palliative care. Disclosing to others the decision, and preparation of assisted suicide emerged to be an important emotional burden for families. Some family members preferred to restrict disclosure before and after assisted suicide, by sometimes not informing other family members until the final days. Conclusions: In Switzerland, there is limited interaction between families and health care professionals concerning assisted suicide decisions, whereas families reported more open interactions with right-to-die associations. It is recommended that the needs of families should be reflected in health policies, taking into consideration the different contexts where assisted dying is permitted.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health",10.1089/jpm.2019.0286     EA NOV 2019,"QUALITATIVE RESEARCH;DECISION-MAKING;SWITZERLAND;DEATH;EUTHANASIA;PHYSICIANS;PATIENT;INVOLVEMENT;REQUESTS;END;Suicide, Assisted;Suicide;Statistics as Topic",,,5_adresses_government_health,,Excluded,Excluded,1

Under these circumstances, professional societies and associations in the healthcare sector recommended the use of video consultations. The objective of this analysis was to generate statistically relevant insights into the use of video consultations before and during the Covid-19 pandemic        Methods This study is based on the analysis of a comprehensive claims data set comprising anonymized data of 5.6 million beneficiaries of a large German health insurance fund. The dataset encompassed healthcare claims from 1 January 2019 to 30 June 2020 covering 29,464,913 patient contacts. The claims were divided into video consultations and face-to-face consultations. This paper presents descriptive statistics and analyses associations between variables.        Results In 8,077 out of all contacts, a video consultation had taken place. This translates into 3.12 of 10,000 contacts. There was no significant difference in the utilization of video consultations by gender. However, the age differed significantly (Chi-square:2280.01, Sig: 0.000) between the contacts with or without use of video consultation. There is a significant increase of up to 27 times the use of video consultation in the first lockdown compared to the same month in 2019.        Conclusions Apparent higher usage of telemedicine by patients in the age group 50 to 64 years and the very low usage in the group of 65 to 74 years shows that the use of video consultation is age sensitive and should be subject to goal-oriented implementation of telemedical offers. The observed increase, however, is small relative to the total number of patient contacts and is not significant.

However, this is inherently political, positioning people as active and activist in the relationship of their lives with their communities. The research aimed to interrogate an existing qualitative dataset in partnership with people living with dementia to inform the development of a way of working with people with dementia that is empowering. In this qualitative secondary data analysis project, we (1) analysed data through two theoretical lenses: Douglas' cultural theory of risk and Tronto's Ethic of Care, and (2) co-analysed the data together with people living with dementia during 16 workshops. The design involved cycles of presenting, interpreting, representing and reinterpreting the data and findings between multiple stakeholders. We identified a granular understanding of the way relationships change for people with dementia and how subtle factors and nuanced behaviour contribute to social exclusion, or support social inclusion. The results support relational care through the co-operative endeavour (of co-operative communication, co-operative action and co-operative care) in promoting the inclusion of people living with dementia.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",10.1177/1471301218795353,PEOPLE;CITIZENSHIP;MANAGEMENT;ETHICS;RISK;PARTNERSHIP;FRIENDSHIPS;EMPOWERMENT;DISABILITY;QUALITY;Dementia;Statistics as Topic,,,"1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",,Excluded,Excluded,1

Numerous attempts are made to develop a framework to secure quality of care. However, research has shown insufficient quality in care for older people. In this study, the purpose is to study how older people's experiences with home care reflect a person-centred approach to care. Data derived from an earlier study on ageing among home-dwelling men and women who are aged 67-91 and living in the Faroe Islands.        BackgroundPerson-centredness as a concept is an often quoted, but ill-defined concept. Most studies concerning person-centred care are conducted within hospital wards or long-term care institutions. Empirical studies concerning home-dwelling older people receiving home care are scarce.        MethodsThe study is a secondary analysis of data from an earlier qualitative study. Latent thematic analysis was used which meant coding issues of potential interest and collecting these codes into themes.        ResultsThree themes appeared to combine the initial codes: sense of involvement, sense of meaningfulness and contextual conditions. Overall, the analysis showed that the users were seldom involved in planning or scheduling the care they received. What they were offered did not always make sense to them or correspond to their needs or preferences.        ConclusionsThe number of interviews included was limited. However, findings from this study point at some possible barriers to successful implementation of person-centredness within elder care. Especially, contextual conditions seem to limit the facilitation of person-centred practices.        Relevance to clinical practiceHealthcare providers must take the user's preferences, resources and networks into consideration when coordinating and planning home care and, importantly, be open for negotiating needs. It is important to draw attention to the contrast between political intentions regarding elder care and the limited options for putting the intentions into practice.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",10.1111/jocn.14161,QUALITATIVE DATA;OLDER-PEOPLE;EXPERIENCES;AGENDA,,,"1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",,Excluded,Excluded,1

Few studies have examined how language barriers influence provider role implementation or workload in the home health care setting.        Objectives: To explore home health care professionals' perspectives about how workload changes from managing language barriers influence quality and safety in home health care.        Design: A qualitative secondary data analysis using a summative content analysis approach was used to analyze existing semi-structured interview data.        Setting: A large urban home health care agency located on the East Coast of the United States.        Participants: Thirty five home health care providers [31 registered nurses, 3 physical therapists, 1 occupational therapist].        Results: A total of 142 discrete incidents emerged from the analysis. Overall, home health care providers experienced distinct shifts in how they implemented their roles that added to their workload and time spent with Limited English Proficiency patients and family members. Providers were concerned about interpretation accuracy and perceived it as potentially posing risks to patient safety. Changes in work patterns, therefore, sought to maximize patient safety.        Conclusions: Home health care providers decision-making about how they adapt practice when faced with a language barrier is a sequence of actions based on awareness of the patient's language preference and if they spoke another language. Subsequent choices showed proactive behaviors to manage increased workload shaped by their perceived risk of the threats posed by the quality of interpreter services. Future research should develop quantitative models examining differences in workload when caring for limited English proficiency versus English speaking patients as well as the relationship between visit length and patient outcomes to determine optimal quality models.

The analysis is underpinned by the theoretical framework of the Offspring Cancer Needs Instrument OCNI, (Patterson et al., 2013). Method: A secondary data analysis was carried out with ten maternal interviews analyzed using a deductive Thematic Analysis. This was to identify maternal unmet needs as well as their perceptions of their adolescent children's unmet needs and determine whether the OCNI framework was suitable to identify unmet needs of mothers and adolescent children in an Irish context.Results: The study found cancer is a challenging emotional burden for both mothers and their adolescent children. Emotions related to cancer recurrence were particularly difficult to deal with. Mothers struggle to identify the unmet needs of adolescent children and recognize that they lack the skills to approach the children, which adds to the burden of their illness burden and feelings of guilt. Conclusions: The study highlights the need to provide safe spaces for patients and adolescent children to deal with their emotions, strengthen relationships and improve communication associated with maternal cancer as these have a significant impact in their lives and may lead to tension and conflict within families.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using",10.1016/j.ejon.2022.102191     EA MAR 2023,BREAST-CANCER;PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS;YOUNG-ADULTS;MOTHERS;FAMILY;Only Child;Child;Adolescent;Statistics as Topic,,,1 not sharing/ not using,,Excluded,Excluded,1

This research aims to describe and account for the entrepreneurship levels, particularly in order to understand what leads certain countries' individuals to display higher levels of initiative to manage or create a high-growth business. In order to achieve this goal, a research program that includes annual assessments of entrepreneurial activity levels in several countries has been used-The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM), which is, currently, one of the main international research databases aiming to describe, analyse and compare the entrepreneurial process in a wide range of countries. The database studied in this work is the 2011 NES, containing 144 variables in which 136 are qualitative (97 ordinal qualitative and 39 nominal qualitative). The data were analysed transforming the ordinal qualitative variables in ordinal quantitative, where the answers were given in a Likert scale from 1 to 5. The sample of the database consists of 1852 national and regional entrepreneurship experts selected on the basis of reputation and experience (through a convenience sample approach). Our research used several multivariate analysis techniques, in particular the multiple linear regression analysis, the cluster analysis and the discriminant analysis. In general, our conclusions suggest that individuals who react quickly to opportunities seem to display better abilities of time management and are more willing to start a business.

Findings The data available in Kenyan schools were similar except for context data which had slight variations between schools. Head teachers mainly used school-level data to monitor school functioning, plan and develop school-level policies which mainly focused on school and curriculum improvement but little on teacher improvement. Teacher improvement attempts were mostly via benchmarking. The results also show that Kenyan head teachers hide inspection reports from teachers and that some head teachers used data creatively than others.

The current view of IQ in a healthcare context is static. It assumes that once the EHR system generates the information product, individual users may act on the information based on their subjective perception of its quality. However, this view ignores the complexities of secondary use of EHR data, in which users are actively involved in (re)generating and communicating the information product. Thus, IQ does not remain static but keeps on transforming through active engagement and interpersonal communication. To contribute to this debate, we conducted a qualitative case study in a Norwegian healthcare context by employing an IQ life cycle model. In conclusion, we enhanced the existing IQ model by (1) adding interpersonal communication, (2) showing the interrelations of the IQ dimensions, and (3) integrating the mechanisms of the transformation process for IQ in secondary use of EHR data. In doing so, we unfold the dynamics of IQ in the secondary use of EHR data.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health",10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2020.102227,ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS;FRAMEWORK;MANAGEMENT;ONTOLOGY;INSIGHTS;Quality of Life,,,5_adresses_government_health,,Excluded,Excluded,1

Method: Secondary data were generated manually by gathering user feedback for 62 different DCHDs (cost range: $9.95-$635) on the Amazon.com website, which included 11,258 unique Amazon-verified customer reviews. The data were analyzed using both quantitative and qualitative analyses methods.        Results: The cluster analysis of large data corpus resulted in 7 unique clusters, which were labeled as (a) Issues related to fit and comfort (15%), (b) Friends and family recommendations (11.8%), (c) Issues related to sound quality (11.9%), (d) Listening and conversation (16.1%), (e) Positive customer service (12.1%), (f) General usage and customer service (14.7%), and (g) Cost and affordability (17.3%). Exploratory analysis also revealed an association between customer ratings and cost in relation to these clusters (i.e., customer reviews). For example, customer reviews about cheaper DCHDs are related to issues about sound quality, whereas reviews about expensive DCHDs are related to cost and affordability of the device. The qualitative content analysis resulted in 8 main themes, which include (a) intrinsic factors, (b) extrinsic factors, (c) supplemental items, (d) ease of use, (e) interaction with support services, (f) reasons for purchase, (g) experiences, and (h) general information.        Conclusions: The study using the text mining techniques highlights the benefits and shortcomings of DCHDs that are currently available in the U.S. market. Our findings relate well to the published study results of electroacoustic analysis on similar products, which provide clinicians with knowledge related to DCHDs that they can convey to consumers during clinical consultations. The findings may also be of interest to the hearing instrument industry from the perspective of developing products based on user feedback.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",10.1044/2018_JSLHR-H-18-0370,OLDER-ADULTS;HEALTH;AID;INFODEMIOLOGY;PERSPECTIVES,,,"1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",,Excluded,Excluded,1

Quality and bias were assessed using the QualSyst criteria for qualitative and quantitative studies. This paper focuses on a subset of 35 articles identified from the wider search which focus on issues of privacy, trust, and transparency. Studies included a total of 56,365 respondents. Results of this systematic literature review indicate that while respondents identified advantages in sharing health data, concerns relating to trust, transparency, and privacy remain. Organisations collecting health data and those who seek to share data or undertake secondary data analysis should continue to develop trust, transparency, and privacy with healthcare consumers through open dialogue and education. Consideration should be given to these issues at all stages of data collection including the conception, design, and implementation phases. While individuals understand the benefits of health data sharing for research purposes, ensuring a balance between public benefit and individual privacy is essential. Researchers and those undertaking secondary data analysis need to be cognisant of these key issues at all stages of their research.

In this article, we argue that qualitative research which moves beyond these dominant paradigms can contribute to answering this question, and we demonstrate this by reporting on focus group research in three European countries (the United Kingdom, Norway and Spain). Our method created a space in which to make sense of the diverse findings of quantitative studies, which relate to individual differences (such as extent of social media use or awareness of social media data mining) and differences in social media data mining practices themselves (such as the type of data gathered, the purpose for which data are mined and whether transparent information about data mining is available). Moving beyond privacy and surveillance made it possible to identify a concern for fairness as a common trope among users, which informed their varying viewpoints on distinct data mining practices. We argue that this concern for fairness can be understood as contextual integrity in practice (Nissenbaum, 2009) and as part of broader concerns about well-being and social justice.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using | USER-NOTES: {""""Jürgen""""=>[""""social media data not = reuse of data, but usage of natural data""""]}",10.1177/1354856515592507,PRIVACY,,,1 not sharing/ not using |,,Excluded,Excluded,1

Design        A cross-sectional survey targeting all Lausanne University Hospital professionals was performed in the fall of 2013.        Material and methods        The survey considered ten job satisfaction dimensions (e.g. self-fulfilment, workload, management, work-related burnout, organisational commitment, intent to stay) and included an open comment section. Computer-assisted qualitative analyses were conducted on these comments. Satisfaction rates on the included dimensions and professional groups were entered as predictive variables in the qualitative analyses.

Results        Almost a third of the comments addressed scheduling issues, mostly related to problems and exhaustion linked to shifts, work-life balance, and difficulties with colleagues' absences and the consequences for quality of care and patient safety. The other two-thirds related to classic themes included in job satisfaction surveys. Although some comments were provided equally by all professional groups, others were group specific: work and hierarchy pressures for physicians, healthcare quality and patient safety for nurses, skill recognition for administrative staff.

A qualitative study of MET/CBT-5 implementation in community agencies treating adolescents found that the majority of the agencies made adaptations and that the most frequent adaptation was to provide more than five treatment sessions.        Methods: Baseline and outcome data from SAMHSA's Effective Adolescent Treatment demonstration were analyzed to assess associations between length of treatment, client characteristics, and outcomes at three months.        Results: Adolescents who received more or less than the protocol length of 5 sessions were less likely to be discharged to the community than those who received the 5 session protocol. Those who received more than five sessions were more likely to have higher severity scores at intake but almost 50% of those with more than five sessions had low intake severity scores. Clients who received less than five sessions tended to have lower severity scores than clients who received more than five sessions.        Conclusions: Length of treatment tended to vary by site rather than severity of substance problems or frequency of use. There was no significant improvement of substance abuse problems or decrease in frequency of use with longer treatment.

Current EMIS technologies often focus on industrial applications or require large upfront investments and trained operators, therefore greatly limiting its penetration into existing buildings. This paper integrates methods from social, building, and data sciences to understand limitations of current EMIS systems and inform the design of a new Multitiered Energy Management Performance Indicators (MEMPI) framework for characterizing the energy performance of buildings. Specifically, we employed a mixed methods research approach in which we first conduct in-depth qualitative interviews of 10 facility managers and energy consultants. We utilize the insights from our interviews to inform the design of the MEMPI framework, which harnesses highly granular data from already installed advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) (i.e., smart meters). The MEMPI framework employs quantile regression to first benchmark the energy performance of buildings to each other and generate key performance indicators (KPIs). We apply the MEMPI framework to real data from 569 public school buildings in California and measure their energy performance across multiple time scales (e.g., daily, monthly, yearly). Finally, we conduct case studies to compare insights from the MEMPI framework to the perceptions of facility managers overseeing 8 schools through a mixed methods qualitative and quantitative post-interview survey. Results from the case study show that facility managers' perceptions of the performance of their schools were largely accurate, yet the poor energy performance from certain pieces of building equipment and operating schedules was overlooked by building managers. Overall, the MEMPI framework aims to bridge the gap between data-driven energy management models and qualitative domain knowledge held by facility managers to provide more comprehensive insights into the energy performance of buildings.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using",10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.115435,FAULT-DETECTION;RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS;EFFICIENCY RETROFITS;DRIVING        FORCES;CONSUMPTION;BENCHMARKING;FEEDBACK;VARIABLES;BARRIERS;CONSERVATION,,,1 not sharing/ not using,,Excluded,Excluded,1

Design/methodology/approach The authors structure their research as a multiple case study based on three OD ecosystems, each defined by a mid-sized European art museum at its centre. Qualitative analysis of the case studies proceeds from interviews with museum management staff and policy-related agencies in three European countries, in addition to document analysis. Findings The results of this study suggest that museums are sensitive towards their environments and respond to their ecosystem based on what is communicated within their networks. However, museums are not effective in communicating with their users, limiting the informational interdependence necessary for well-functioning OD ecosystems. EU policy appears to be a driving force along with national financial incentives, though institutional conditions are limiting progress. Advancing the field relies instead on an epistemological shift to understand the museum as part of a larger information network. Originality/value As the first comparative case study of art museum OD ecosystems that the authors are aware of, the study provides a qualitative analysis of the complex dynamics impacting OD policy within the mid-sized art museum. The authors identify specific dynamics that are thus far restricting further development of the OD ecosystem of the mid-sized European art museum.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health",10.1108/JD-05-2021-0102     EA OCT 2021,OPEN GOVERNMENT DATA;ICT-ADOPTION;Museums,,,5_adresses_government_health,,Excluded,Excluded,1

The synthesis of interviews reveals that many organizations are still in the early stage of the adoption process, mainly due to a lack of resources, especially expertise. Besides the factors of the three contexts of TOE, the project-level factors are also found to be critical for the adoption of big data in project management.

Further, using logistic regressions, girls who were heavy garners ( > 9 h/wk) at 13-14 years were found to be more likely to pursue a PSTEM degree but this was influenced by their socio-economic status. Similar associations with boys and PSTEM degrees were not found or were weak. Therefore, girls were self-socialising or self determining their identity groups through gaming. This research can provide the basis for whether encouraging gaming in adolescent girls can help them onto PSTEM pathways.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using",10.1016/j.chb.2018.10.001,ACADEMIC SELF-CONCEPT;SCHOOL GIRLS;GENDER-DIFFERENCES;COMPUTER GAMES;SINGLE-SEX;SCIENCE;STEM;STEREOTYPES;MEDIA;ACHIEVEMENT;Statistics as Topic,,,1 not sharing/ not using,,Excluded,Excluded,1

These platforms are envisioned to enhance and facilitate the international sharing of cohort data. Nevertheless, broad data sharing may be restricted by the lack of adequate recognition for those who share data.        Objective: The aim of this study is to describe in depth the concerns about acquiring credit for data sharing within epidemiological research.        Methods: A total of 17 participants linked to European Union-funded data-sharing platforms were recruited for a semistructured interview. Transcripts were analyzed using inductive content analysis.        Results: Interviewees argued that data sharing within international projects could challenge authorship guidelines in multiple ways. Some respondents considered that the acquisition of credit for articles with extensive author lists could be problematic in some instances, such as for junior researchers. In addition, universities may be critical of researchers who share data more often than leading research. Some considered that the evaluation system undervalues data generators and specialists. Respondents generally looked favorably upon alternatives to the current evaluation system to potentially ameliorate these issues.        Conclusions: The evaluation system might impede data sharing because it mainly focuses on first and last authorship and undervalues the contributor's work. Further movement of crediting models toward contributorship could potentially address this issue. Appropriate crediting mechanisms that are better aligned with the way science ought to be conducted in the future need to be developed.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health | USER-NOTES: {""""Jürgen""""=>[""""qualitative data? human data?""""]}",10.2196/25983,AUTHORSHIP;TIME;COLLABORATION;SCIENCE;SHIFT;Information Dissemination;Europe,,,5_adresses_government_health |,,Excluded,Excluded,1

Despite this, PA-specific practical guidance for school-based research is lacking, which may present unique challenges to researchers. Based on reflections from our own experiences, this paper seeks to provide practical guidance on how best to approach school-based PA data collection. Discussion: This paper focuses on the practicalities of quantitative and qualitative data collection in English primary (4-11 years) and secondary (11-16 years) schools. Recruitment and consent are discussed, and practical guidance provided with respect to engagement with parent/carer(s) and ethical considerations. The importance of good communication with schools, together with its importance in facilitating efficient data collection (through planning, data collection and resource utilisation), is described. Finally, the importance of giving back to the school and participants once a research project has been completed is stressed. Improved understanding of data collection procedures for school-based PA research is key to helping research become more systematic and efficient. Findings in this paper will be particularly useful to undergraduate and postgraduate students and early career researchers.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using",10.1177/0017896920959092     EA SEP 2020,ELEMENTARY-SCHOOLS;IMPLEMENTATION;INTERVENTIONS;OUTCOMES;CHILDREN;CONSENT;GUIDE;MODEL;Motor Activity,,,1 not sharing/ not using,,Excluded,Excluded,1

Second, interpretation of historical data often requires the tools of humanities disciplines, which produce a further historicization of data. Finally, some qualitative social scientists hold that data are personal to the researcher who coconstructs them in the research process and are therefore skeptical about the prospects of reusing data.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Included"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Included""""} | USER-NOTES: {""""Jürgen""""=>[""""maybe no barriers/facilitators?""""]}","",REFLECTIONS,,,,,Included,Included,1

The authors used a bibliometric mapping tool for familiarization with the literature. After that, the authors used qualitative analysis software to develop taxonomy.Findings This paper developed taxonomy of OGD with three research areas: implementation and management, architecture, users and utilization. These research areas are further analyzed into seven topics and twenty-eight subtopics. The present study extends Charalabidis et al. (2016) taxonomy by adding two research topics, namely the adoption factors and barriers of OGD implementations and OGD ecosystems. Also, the authors include artificial intelligence in the taxonomy as an emerging research interest in the literature. The authors suggest four directions for future research: indigenous knowledge in open data, open data at local governments, development of OGD-specific theories and user studies in certain research themes.Practical implications Early career researchers and doctoral students can use the taxonomy to familiarize themselves with the literature. Also, established researchers can use the proposed taxonomy to inform future research. Taxonomy-building procedures in this study are applicable to other fields.Originality/value This study developed a novel taxonomy of research areas in OGD. Taxonomy building is significant because there is insufficient taxonomy of research areas in this discipline. Also, conceptual knowledge through taxonomy creation is a basis for theorizing and theory-building for future studies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health",10.1108/OIR-02-2022-0117     EA APR 2023,QUALITY;BUSINESS;CHALLENGES;BARRIERS;ADOPTION,,,5_adresses_government_health,,Excluded,Excluded,1

Increasing immunization coverage rates requires an effective cold chain to maintain vaccine potency. Remote temperature monitoring (RTM) technology for vaccine refrigerators has shown promise for improving the ability of supply systems to maintain optimal temperature conditions to ensure potent vaccines reach the end users.        Methods: A pilot study of RTM technology and data use teams was implemented in 36 study sites in Kenya. Data were collected at baseline and endline points over a 3-month baseline and 7-month implementation period. Data included 44 qualitative interviews, process logs, meeting minutes from data use team meetings, and quantitative temperature and power data from the RTM devices.        Results: The ability of cold chain equipment to maintain World Health Organization-recommended temperatures in study sites improved markedly between the baseline and implementation periods, resulting in an improvement in total time spent in the correct range from 83.9% in the baseline period to 90.9% in the intervention period and an improvement in time spent in the too cold range from 6.5% to 1.5%. Friedman tests revealed that differences in time spent in the correct range and time spent in the too cold range during the course of the study were statistically significant (P<.001 and P=.04, respectively). Qualitative and quantitative data suggest that this improvement was due to a combination of improved responsiveness to temperature excursions at the facility level, resulting from SMS alarms for temperature excursion periods, and improved ability at the management level to recognize and address recurring problems.        Conclusion: The combination of using RTM technology with a structured data review process by a management team is a promising approach for improving cold chain outcomes. Future research examining the added value of each of the technological and behavioral components separately is needed.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",10.9745/GHSP-D-19-00157,CHAIN;EXPOSURE;TECHNOLOGY;Vaccination;Vaccines;Cold Temperature;Kenya,,,"1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",,Excluded,Excluded,1

Study Design and Setting: We searched the literature for surveys with open-ended questions and assessed the methods used to determine sample size in 100 studies selected at random. Then, we used Monte Carlo simulations on data from a previous study on the burden of treatment to assess the probability of identifying new themes as a function of the number of patients recruited.        Results: In the literature, 85% of researchers used a convenience sample, with a median size of 167 participants (interquartile range [IQR] = 69-406).

The scale, pace and novelty of these applications raise a number of urgent sociotechnical, ethical and legal questions, including optimal methods of data storage, management and access. Although the open science movement advocates unfettered access to research data, many of the UK's longitudinal cohort studies operate systems of managed data access, in which access is governed by legal and ethical agreements between stewards of research datasets and researchers wishing to make use of them. Amongst other things, these agreements aim to respect the reasonable expectations of the research participants who provided data and samples, as expressed in the consent process. Arguably, responsible data management and governance of data and sample use are foundational to the consent process in longitudinal studies and are an important source of trustworthiness in the eyes of those who contribute data to genomic and biosocial research.        Methods: This paper presents an ethnographic case study exploring the foundational principles of a governance infrastructure for Managing Ethico-social, Technical and Administrative issues in Data ACcess (METADAC), which are operationalised through a committee known as the METADAC Access Committee. METADAC governs access to phenotype, genotype and 'omit' data and samples from five UK longitudinal studies.        Findings: Using the example of METADAC, we argue that three key structural features are foundational for practising responsible data sharing: independence and transparency; interdisciplinarity; and participant-centric decision-making. We observe that the international research community is proactively working towards optimising the use of research data, integrating/linking these data with routine data generated by health and social care services and other administrative data services to improve the analysis, interpretation and utility of these data. The governance of these new complex data assemblages will require a range of expertise from across a number of domains and disciplines, including that of study participants. Human-mediated decision-making bodies will be central to ensuring achievable, reasoned and responsible decisions about the use of these data; the METADAC model described in this paper provides an example of how this could be realised.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health",10.1186/s40246-018-0154-6,COHORT PROFILE;ASSOCIATION;SCIENCE;Information Dissemination,,,5_adresses_government_health,,Excluded,Excluded,1

We use various dimensions of CSR to examine whether firms rely on different combinations of CSR, in terms of quality versus quantity of CSR practices. Our empirical analysis based on an original database including 10,293 French firms shows that different CSR dimensions in isolation impact positively firms' profits but their effect in term on intensity varies among CSR dimensions. Moreover, the findings on the qualitative CSR measure, based on interaction between its dimensions, show that the substitutability of these dimensions is highly significant for firm performance. However, in terms of the intensity, those interactions produce differential effects. Actually, asking whether a firm starting with a certain configuration cannot perform better by adding or removing some dimension(s) we found that only one configuration fulfills this requirement: green and HR. The interpretation is that when a firm starts with this configuration then it is better not to move to another configuration. In all other configurations, firms can always improve their profits either by adding or removing some dimensions. Finally, the profitability of CSR investments in French firms seems to rely on a specific qualitative mix of different CSR dimensions rather than a pure quantitative approach accumulating practices without designing a consistent set of interactions among them.

Aim: To explore data management practices, facilitators, and barriers to immunization data quality among front-line immunization experts in the Tach Gayint district of Northwest Ethiopia.        Methods: A mixed method study design was applied using document review and key-informant interviews. Quantitative data was collected through document review from 18 health facilities and 26 key-informant interviews, were conducted on experts of immunization for qualitative data. A STATA version 14.1 was used for quantitative data analysis. Qualitative data was transcribed verbatim and translated back into English. Data was coded, reduced, and searched for salient patterns. Thematic analysis was done using open-code version 4.02.        Results: The Health Management Information System data recording tools were often lacking. The significant number (83.3%) of health facilities practiced immunization information display, while dissemination at the local level was low. The key informants mentioned that they were responsible for conducting regular Performance Monitoring Team (PMT) and Lots Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS) as facilitators. Furthermore, a shortage of recording tools. limited supportive supervision, vertical reporting, impracticality of Lots of Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS) at the health posts. poor implementation of Community Health Information System (CHIS), and mass vaccination were barriers identified to immunization data quality.        Conclusion: We found that majority of health workers use locally developed tools instead of using the standard data recording and reporting tools. Regular Performance Monitoring Team meetings and Lots Quality Assurance Sampling assessment were found to be facilitators.

This can challenge the planning and implementation of participatory data governance in healthcare services locally. Engaging with local stakeholders and understanding how their needs, values and preferences for governing health data can be articulated with policies made at the supranational level is crucial. This paper describes a protocol for a project that aims to coproduce a people-centred model for involving patients and the public in decision-making processes about the use and sharing of health data for rare diseases care and research. Methods and analysis This multidisciplinary project draws on an explanatory sequential mixed-methods study. A hospital-based survey with patients, informal carers, health professionals and technical staff recruited at two reference centres for rare diseases in Portugal will be conducted first. The qualitative study will follow consisting of semi-structured interviews and scenario-based workshops with a subsample of the participant groups recruited at baseline. Quantitative data will be analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Inductive and deductive approaches will be combined to analyse the qualitative interviews. Data from scenario-based workshops will be iteratively compared using the constant comparison method to identify cross-cutting themes and categories. Ethics and dissemination The Ethics Committee for Health from the University Hospital Centre Sao Joao/Faculty of Medicine of University of Porto approved the study protocol (Ref. 99/19). Research findings will be disseminated at academic conferences and science promotion events, and through public meetings involving patient representatives, practitioners, policy-makers and students, a project website and peer-reviewed journal publications.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health",10.1136/bmjopen-2020-044289,MEDICINE;ACCESS;POLICY,,,5_adresses_government_health,,Excluded,Excluded,1

Typically the argument has been made for the need to protect individual writers and engage with these documents in a considered manner that recognises the inherent vulnerability of amateur authors. This paper will argue that a framing of these writers that foregrounds their potential vulnerability, naivety and even ignorance is in fact highly paternalistic, and therefore counter to an ethical approach to research. In seeking to protect authors from harm, we deny their agency and diminish the act of online publication. Further, this approach, prevalent in academia, is at odds with the legal position, and arguably, the weight of social understanding. A reframing of amateur online authors as informed agents not only increases the accessibility of these data to researchers and subsequently policy makers, but also alludes to a need to credit the contribution of authors without the need to seek permission. Ultimately, this paper argues for a presumption of accountability, unless otherwise proven, and an approach to the use of self-published online material that mirrors the use of other sorts of secondary data with perceived """"professional"""" authors, such as magazine articles, newspaper columns or organisational literature.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 4_not_prerequisites_barriers_facilitators_ | USER-NOTES: {""""Jürgen""""=>[""""rather risks""""]}",10.1111/area.12445,HEALTH INFORMATION;ONLINE;SPACE;BLOGOSPHERE;TRANSITION;INTERNET;NETNOGRAPHY;FEMININITY;NETWORKING;PATIENT;Informed Consent,,,4_not_prerequisites_barriers_facilitators_ |,,Excluded,Excluded,1

This study develops a Democratic Activity Model of Open Data Use, which is illustrated by anexploratory qualitative multiple case study outlining three democratic processes: monitorial, deliberative and participatory.

However, repurposing data can be problematic and little research has been undertaken into the everyday practicalities of inter-system data sharing that helps explain why this is so, especially within (as opposed to between) organisations. In response, this article reports one of the most detailed empirical examinations undertaken to date of the work involved in repurposing healthcare data for National Clinical Audits.MethodsFifty-four semi-structured, qualitative interviews were carried out with staff in five English National Health Service hospitals about their audit work, including 20 staff involved substantively with audit data collection. In addition, ethnographic observations took place on wards, in 'back offices' and meetings (102h). Findings were analysed thematically and synthesised in narratives.ResultsAlthough data were available within hospital applications for secondary use in some audit fields, which could, in theory, have been auto-populated, in practice staff regularly negotiated multiple, unintegrated systems to generate audit records. This work was complex and skilful, and involved cross-checking and double data entry, often using paper forms, to assure data quality and inform quality improvements.ConclusionsIf technology is to facilitate the secondary use of healthcare data, the skilled but largely hidden labour of those who collect and recontextualise those data must be recognised. Their detailed understandings of what it takes to produce high quality data in specific contexts should inform the further development of integrated systems within organisations.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health",10.1186/s12913-021-06657-0,ELECTRONIC PATIENT RECORD;INFORMATION,,,5_adresses_government_health,,Excluded,Excluded,1

Five cohorts of students at two universities participated in the study. They offered written responses to three open-ended questions. Individual follow-up interviews were conducted with fourteen students that were based on their previous written answers to understand their reasoning in more depth. A fine-grained analysis was undertaken to unpack students' reasoning by grouping the criteria they used to judge the quality of the data into three broad categories: criteria independent of the data, criteria that based on the variation of the raw data, and criteria based on the variation of the derived quantity. We argue that responses in each category can be linked to different learning objectives. The students proposed various actions to increase the trustworthiness of the covarying data or a conclusion based on it. We have investigated to what extent decisions and proposed actions were consistent. Students generally showed a fragmented and primarily qualitative understanding of the concepts of mean, uncertainty, and line of best fit. Many students proposed to determine the value of a derived quantity by applying the equation relating it to the measurands to individual data points, all data points, or all data points except for outliers. Students appear to consider the best fit line as a tool for eliminating outliers, but much less frequently as a way to determine a derived quantity.

Earlier research suggests that the sorting process is socially, not just academically, selective. Building on this, we analyse factors influencing whether individuals make use of the available opportunities for changing track. We find that, rather than alleviating the early social inequality, these opportunities reinforce it since young people from more privileged backgrounds are more likely to benefit from flexibility, whereas disadvantaged individuals are more likely to drop out of the academic track. Most earlier relevant work has used regression-based methods, but we use an alternative configurational method, Ragin's Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA).

Nurse migration is multifactorial and not limited to financial incentives. Non-economic factors that might lead to migration include poor recruitment and retention strategies, poor job satisfaction and working conditions, socio-political and economic stability, and the poor social image of the nursing profession. Lebanon is facing a problem of excessive nurse migration to countries of the Gulf, North America and Europe. No study has been conducted to understand the determinants and magnitude of the problem.        Objective: The objective of this study is to provide an evidence base for understanding the incidence of nurse migration out of Lebanon, its magnitude and reasons.        Design: A cross-sectional research design comprising both quantitative and qualitative methods was employed to achieve the stated objectives. This includes a survey of nursing schools in Lebanon, survey of nurse recruitment agencies, secondary data analysis and survey of migrant nurses.        Results: An estimated one in five nurses that receive a bachelors of science in nursing migrates out of Lebanon within 1 or 2 years of graduation. The majority of nurses migrate to countries of the Gulf. The main reasons for migration included: shift work, high patient/nurse ratios, lack of autonomy in decision-making, lack of a supportive environment, and poor commitment to excellent nursing care. Further, nurses reported that combinations of financial and non-financial incentives can encourage them to return to practice in Lebanon. The most recurring incentives (pull factors) to encourage nurses to return to practice in Lebanon included educational support, managerial support, better working conditions, utilization of best nursing practices and autonomy.        Conclusion: Nurse migration and retention have become major health workforce issues confronting many health systems in the East Mediterranean Region. Our study demonstrated that nurse migration is a product of poor management and lack of effective-retention strategies and sufficient knowledge about the context, needs and challenges facing nurses. Nurse migration in Lebanon underscores the importance of developing a monitoring system that would identify implications and help implement innovative retention strategies. Nurse migration out of Lebanon is likely to persist and even increase if underlying factors are not properly resolved. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In the public focus groups, 75% of participants were women, 75% had some college education or more, 46% were African-American and 29% were Hispanic. In the NUgene focus groups, 67% of participants were women, 95% had some college education or more, and the majority (76%) of participants was Caucasian. Five major themes were identified in the focus group data: (a) a wide spectrum of understanding of genetic research; (b) pros and cons of participation in genetic research; (c) influence of credibility and trust of the research institution; (d) concerns about sharing genetic research data and need for transparency in the Policy for Sharing of Data in National Institutes of Health-Supported or Conducted Genome-Wide Association Studies; (e) a need for more information and education about genetic research. In order to increase public understanding and address potential concerns about genetic research, future efforts should be aimed at involving the public in genetic research policy development and in identifying or developing appropriate educational strategies to meet the public's needs.

Design/methodology/approach - Two strands of work were undertaken sequentially: first, content analysis of 37 RDM policies from UK HEIs; and second, two detailed case studies of institutions with different approaches to RDM based on semi-structured interviews with staff involved in the development of RDM policy and services. The data are interpreted using insights from Actor Network Theory.        Findings - RDM policy formation and service development has created a complex set of networks within and beyond institutions involving different professional groups with widely varying priorities shaping activities. Data sharing is considered an important activity in the policies and services of HEIs studied, but its prominence can in most cases be attributed to the positions adopted by large research funders.        Research limitations/implications - The case studies, as research based on qualitative data, cannot be assumed to be universally applicable but do illustrate a variety of issues and challenges experienced more generally, particularly in the UK.        Practical implications - The research may help to inform development of policy and practice in RDM in HEIs and funder organisations.

The Key Implications of Data Sharing (KIDS) framework was therefore developed to address a need for institutional guidance on genomic data governance but has yet to be validated among data sharing practitioners in practice settings. This study qualitatively explored areas of consensus and dissensus of the KIDS Framework from the perspectives of Canadian clinician-scientists, genomic researchers, IRB members, and pediatric ethicists. Methods Twelve panelists participated in a three-round online policy Delphi to determine the desirability, feasibility, relative importance and confidence of twelve individual statements of the KIDS Framework. Mean and IQR were calculated from panelists' ratings to determine the strength of consensus and polarity. Qualitative content analysis of panelists' written responses was used to assess degree of support. Statements were validated when their combined ratings and qualitative rationales indicated high-moderate consensus (at least 70% agreement across two contiguous categories), low to no polarity (IQR at least 1.0) and strong support. Results Nine original, and one new statement reached consensus. These statements outlined essential elements of the informed consent process, including a realistic evaluation of benefits and risks and assurance of future ethics oversight for secondary data use. Discrepant views on appropriate protections for anonymized and coded i.e. de-identified genomic data were primary sources of dissensus. Conclusions The validated statements provide institutions with empirically supported best practices for sharing genomic and associated clinical data involving children from the perspectives of key stakeholders. Concerted efforts to quantify informational risks that can be conveyed to patients and families are further needed to align data sharing policy with stakeholder priorities.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health",10.1186/s12910-021-00635-1,ETHICS;Delphi Technique;Canada;Information Dissemination;Genome;Genomics,,,5_adresses_government_health,,Excluded,Excluded,1

Assessing data for trustworthiness becomes important in data reuse with the growth in data creation because of the lack of standards for ensuring data quality and potential harm from using poor-quality data. This research explores many facets of data reusers' trust in data generated by other researchers focusing on the trust judgment process with influential factors that determine reusers' trust. The author took an interpretive qualitative approach by using in-depth semistructured interviews as the primary research method. The study results suggest different stages of trust development associated with the process of data reuse. Data reusers' trust may remain the same throughout their experiences, but it can also be formed, lost, declined, and recovered during their data reuse experiences. These various stages reflect the dynamic nature of trust.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 _not_qualitative/_video_data_",10.1002/asi.23730,SECONDARY ANALYSIS;SCIENTIFIC-DATA;CONTEXT;MODEL,,,2 _not_qualitative/_video_data_,,Excluded,Excluded,1

However, they are insufficiently prepared for use in research, even when it comes to structured data since they were often designed for other purposes. To date, few publications focus on the process of preparing secondary data. The present findings can help in orienting future research projects that are based on secondary data. Objective: Describe the steps in the process of ensuring the adequacy of a secondary data set for a specific use and to identify the challenges of this process. Methods: The present study is qualitative and reports methodological issues about secondary data use. The study material was comprised of 6,059,454 live births and 73,735 infant death records from 2004 to 2013 of children whose mothers resided in the State of Sao Paulo - Brazil. The challenges and description of the procedures to ensure data adequacy were undertaken in 6 steps: (1) problem understanding, (2) resource planning, (3) data understanding, (4) data preparation, (5) data validation and (6) data distribution. For each step, procedures, and challenges encountered, and the actions to cope with them and partial results were described. To identify the most labor-intensive tasks in this process, the steps were assessed by adding the number of procedures, challenges, and coping actions. The highest values were assumed to indicate the most critical steps. Results: In total, 22 procedures and 23 actions were needed to deal with the 27 challenges encountered along the process of ensuring the adequacy of the study material for the intended use. The final product was an organized database for a historical cohort study suitable for the intended use. Data understanding and data preparation were identified as the most critical steps, accounting for about 70% of the challenges observed for data using. Conclusion: Significant challenges were encountered in the process of ensuring the adequacy of secondary health data for research use, mainly in the data understanding and data preparation steps. The use of the described steps to approach structured secondary data and the knowledge of the potential challenges along the process may contribute to planning health research.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health",10.3389/fpubh.2021.642163,BRAZIL,,,5_adresses_government_health,,Excluded,Excluded,1

Clinical inertia may contribute, including patient-physician uncertainty about how variability in blood pressures impacts overall control. Better information display may support clinician-patient hypertension decision making through reduced cognitive load and improved situational awareness. Methods A multidisciplinary team employed iterative user-centered design to create a blood pressure visualization EHR prototype that included patient-generated blood pressure data. An attitude and behavior survey and 10 focus groups with patients (N = 16) and physicians (N = 24) guided iterative design and confirmation phases. Thematic analysis of qualitative data yielded insights into patient and physician needs for hypertension management. Results Most patients indicated measuring home blood pressure, only half share data with physicians. When receiving home blood pressure data, 88% of physicians indicated entering gestalt averages as text into clinical notes. Qualitative findings suggest that including a data visualization that included home blood pressures brought this valued data into physician workflow and decision-making processes. Data visualization helps both patients and physicians to have a fuller understanding of the blood pressure 'story' and ultimately promotes the activated engaged patient and prepared proactive physician central to the Chronic Care Model. Both patients and physicians expressed concerns about workflow for entering and using home blood pressure data for clinical care. Conclusions Our user-centered design process with physicians and patients produced a well-received blood pressure visualization prototype that includes home blood pressures and addresses patient-physician information needs. Next steps include evaluating a recent EHR visualization implementation, designing annotation functions aligned with users' needs, and addressing additional stakeholders' needs (nurses, care managers, caregivers). This significant innovation has potential to improve quality of care for hypertension through better patient-physician understanding of control and goals. It also has the potential to enable remote monitoring of patient blood pressure, a newly reimbursed activity, and is a strong addition to telehealth efforts.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",10.1186/s12911-020-01194-y,CARE;OFFICE;POPULATION;INERTIA;SOCIETY;DISPLAY;FORMAT;NURSES,,,"1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",,Excluded,Excluded,1

This is often framed as a 'digital divide' and addressed through initiatives that increase the availability of information and communication technologies to researchers based in low-resourced environments, as well as the amount of resources freely accessible online. Using qualitative empirical data from a study of lab-based research in Africa we highlight the limitations of this framing and emphasize the range of additional factors necessary to effectively utilize data available online. We adapt Sen's 'capabilities approach' to highlight the distinction between simply making resources available, and fostering researchers' ability to use them. This provides an alternative orientation that highlights the persistence of deep inequalities within the seemingly egalitarian-inspired open data landscape. We propose that the extent and manner of future data sharing will hinge on the ability to respond to the heterogeneity of research environments.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health,2 _not_qualitative/_video_data_",10.1093/scipol/scw036,HEALTH;SCIENCE;FIELD,,,"5_adresses_government_health,2 _not_qualitative/_video_data_",,Excluded,Excluded,1

We use a mix of qualitative and quantitative empirical methods to explore how actor perspective-taking (APT) may mediate joint sensemaking around data visualizations. By applying interpretive coding to 54 conversations wherein APT naturalistically emerged, we identify 3 distinct self-to-data relationships constructed via APT: role-play, projection, and orientation. A further analysis explores how APT was embedded in joint sensemaking of the visualized data. Twelve APT-mediated sensemaking processes are identified; two (extrapolating and noticing absence) were used in conjunction with multiple APT self-to-data relationships, while the remaining ten (e.g., enacting, spatially characterizing, generalizing) were exclusively used with specific self-to-data APT relationships.

The technology-based learning environment examined in this study involved a video conferencing system and learning management system (LMS) for hosting course content and discussion forums. The social networking software Line was used to enhance the social presence of learners. Students (N = 869) enrolled in a summer course participated in a 9-week experiment. Their LMS log data and social media footprints were recorded, and content experts assessed the intrinsic cognitive load (ICL) of each content module through a consensus process. A learning analytics method was applied to identify candidate parameters relating learning behaviors to cognitive load. The instructor assessed the learners' cognitive processes and adjusted the instructional strategies according to the results of statistical, discourse, and qualitative analyses. Practical guidelines related to various cognitive load effects were designed to assist the students with managing their cognitive load by using learning behaviors and analytics data as signals for making a change in learning processes. Teachers of online courses can use the proposed approach as a support tool to identify learning problems and assist learners with maintaining a cognitive load that is conducive to learning.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using","",MENTAL WORKLOAD;ONLINE;IMPACT;ARGUMENTATION;KNOWLEDGE;DESIGN;Cognition,,,1 not sharing/ not using,,Excluded,Excluded,1

This study describes African-American consumers' personal experiences with and perceptions about DTC GT and explores similarities and differences between African-Americans and an earlier cohort of mostly European American consumers. Methods: Twenty semi-structured, qualitative interviews were held with individuals who self-identified as Black/African-American and completed DTC GT between February 2017 and February 2020. Interviews were transcribed and consensus-coded, using inductive content analysis. Results: Participants generally had positive regard for DTC GT. When considering secondary uses of their results or samples, most participants were aware this was a possibility but had little concrete knowledge about company practices. When prompted about potential uses, participants were generally comfortable with research uses but had mixed outlooks on other nonresearch uses such as law enforcement, cloning, and product development. Most participants expressed that consent should be required for any secondary use, with the option to opt out. The most common suggestion for companies was to improve transparency. Compared to European American participants, African-American participants expressed more trust in DTC GT companies compared to healthcare providers, more concerns about law enforcement uses of data, and a stronger expression of community considerations. Discussion/Conclusion: This study found that African-American consumers of DTC GT had a positive outlook about genetic testing and were open to research and some nonresearch uses, provided that they were able to give informed consent. Participants in this study had little knowledge of company practices regarding secondary uses. Compared to an earlier cohort of European American participants, African-American participants expressed more concerns about medical and law enforcement communities' use of data and more reference to community engagement.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health,2 _not_qualitative/_video_data_",10.1159/000525902     EA SEP 2022,HEALTH;PERSPECTIVES;DISPARITIES;ISSUES;Genetic Testing;African Americans;Privacy,,,"5_adresses_government_health,2 _not_qualitative/_video_data_",,Excluded,Excluded,1

Drawing on an open-ended questionnaire from large-scale student surveys, this study uses a machine learning tool aiming to extract teaching behavior topics from large-scale students' open-ended answers and to test the convergent validity of the outcomes by comparing them with theory-driven manual coding outcomes based on expert judgments. We applied a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling analysis, together with a visualization tool (LDAvis), to qualitative data collected from 173,858 secondary education students in the Netherlands. This data-driven machine learning analysis yielded eight topics of teaching behavior domains: Clear explanation, Student-centered supportive learning climate, Lesson variety, Likable characteristics of the teacher, Evoking interest, Monitoring understanding, Inclusiveness and equity, Lesson objectives and formative assessment. In addition, we subjected 864 randomly selected student responses from the same dataset to manual coding, and performed theory-driven content analysis, which resulted in nine teaching behavior domains and 19 sub-domains. Results suggest that the relation between machine learning and human analysis is complementary. By comparing the bottom-up (machine learning analysis) and top-down (content analysis), we found that the pro-posed topic modeling approach reveals unique domains of teaching behavior, and confirmed the validity of the topic modeling outcomes evident from the overlapping topics.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using",10.1016/j.compedu.2022.104682     EA NOV 2022,TEACHERS;QUALITY;TEXT;CLASSROOM;OUTCOMES;FEEDBACK;EYES,,,1 not sharing/ not using,,Excluded,Excluded,1

Objectives: To summarize the literature on secondary use of data (SuD) from EP and EHP systems to support quality and safety of antimicrobial use, to describe any barriers to secondary use and to make recommendations for future work in this field.        Methods: We conducted a systematic search within four databases; we included original research studies that were (1) based on SuD from hospital EP or EHP systems and (2) reported outcomes relating to quality and/or safety of antimicrobial use and/or qualitative findings relating to SuD in this context.        Results: Ninety-four full-text articles were obtained; 14 met our inclusion criteria. Only two described interventions based on SuD; seven described SuD to evaluate other antimicrobial stewardship interventions and five described descriptive or exploratory studies of potential applications of SuD. Types of data used were quantitative antibiotic usage data (n = 9 studies), dose administration data (n = 4) and user log data from an electronic dashboard (n = 1). Barriers included data access, data accuracy and completeness, and complexity when using data from multiple systems or hospital sites.        Conclusions: The literature suggests that SuD from EP and EHP systems is potentially useful to support or evaluate antimicrobial stewardship activities; greater system functionality would help to realize these benefits.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health",10.1093/jac/dkx082,STEWARDSHIP PROGRAM;INTENSIVE-CARE;VANCOMYCIN USE;ORDER ENTRY;TIME;ANTIBIOTICS;CONSUMPTION;IMPACT;ERRORS,,,5_adresses_government_health,,Excluded,Excluded,1

With the aim of overcoming these shortcomings, this paper proposes a framework for sustainable supply chain management composed of six dimensions: methodology, organization, stakeholders, maturity model, human resources, and technology. The main innovations of the framework are that (1) it includes a methodology that acts as a guide to sustainability management and improvement in a holistic way by using a balanced scorecard for any type of supply chain and covering the whole project life cycle; (2) it combines quantitative and qualitative methods for sustainability assessment; (3) it describes the techniques and technology to be used in each task of the methodology; and (4) it identifies the past impact of SC sustainability, as well as predicting its future impact, using Big Data analytics. The practical utility, completeness, and level of detail of the framework were validated through questionnaires answered by both five academics and three professionals. In addition, the framework was applied to a case study to (1) validate its usefulness and (2) to improve it with the feedback obtained.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using",10.3390/su13137004,SOCIAL SUSTAINABILITY;PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS;FRAMEWORK;OPPORTUNITIES;PERFORMANCE;INTEGRATION;TECHNOLOGY;RESILIENCE;INDUSTRY;QUALITY,,,1 not sharing/ not using,,Excluded,Excluded,1

Successful implementation of a data-driven instruction initiative depends highly on the support and acceptance of the instructors. Yet, our understanding of instructors' perspectives regarding the process of data-driven instruction, especially with reference to MOOC teaching, is still limited. Hence, this study was set to characterize MOOC instructors' interest in educational data and their perceived barriers to data use for decision-making. Taking a qualitative approach, data were collected via semi-structured interviews with higher education MOOC instructors from four public universities in Israel. Findings indicated that the instructors showed great interest mostly in data about social interactions between learners and about problems with the MOOC educational resources. The main reported barriers for using educational data for decision-making were lack of customized data, real-time access, data literacy, and institutional support. The results highlight the need to provide MOOC instructors with professional development opportunities for the proper use of educational data for skilled decision-making.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using",10.1007/s10956-022-09984-x     EA AUG 2022,DATA LITERACY;MOOC,,,1 not sharing/ not using,,Excluded,Excluded,1

A comprehensive resource of socio-economic data is the Census, which is undertaken every five years by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) for the whole of Australia. Unfortunately there are qualitative and quantitative issues stemming from the use of ABS census data maps for NRM decision-making, as they are at a different scale to and the boundaries do not coincide with biophysical information. These issues include the variable shape of collection districts, the use of enumerated data for population-based statistics, the large size of collection districts in low populated areas, and the averaging of socio-economic information over the collection districts. Examples highlight these issues and show a way forwards in improving data integration, which includes simple spatial overlay methods and regression modelling.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using",10.1111/j.1745-5871.2007.00476.x,SCALE;QUEENSLAND;ECONOMICS;Health Resources,,,1 not sharing/ not using,,Excluded,Excluded,1

This paper investigates if MPC affects known antecedents for data sharing decisions: control, trust, and risks. Through 23 qualitative interviews in the automotive industry, we find that MPC (1) enables new ways of technology-based control, (2) reduces the need for interorganizational trust, and (3) prevents losing competitive advantage due to data leakage. However, MPC also creates the need to trust technology and introduces new risks of data misuse. These impacts arise if firms perceive benefits from sharing data, have high organizational readiness, and perceive data as non-sensitive. Our findings show that known antecedents of data sharing should be specified differently with MPC in place.

Methods This secondary data analysis used data collected from a literature review to identify randomized controlled pharmacotherapy trials for AUD. Treatment outcomes were selected into abstinence and no heavy drinking. Target effect sizes were calculated for each outcome and a meta-regression was conducted to test the effects of required pre-trial abstinence, required pre-trial AUD diagnosis, and their interaction on effect sizes. A sub-analysis was conducted on trials, which included FDA-approved medications for AUD. Results In total, 118 studies testing 19 medications representing 21,032 treated participants were included in the meta-regression analysis.

We review the nascent literature on this topic, characterize current data management practices, and examine how expanding access to data and data sharing are likely to provide value and pose risks to key stakeholders: end users of electricity, microutilities, macroutilities, governments, development institutions, and researchers. We identify the key opportunities and tensions and provide recommendations for the design and implementation of new data-sharing practices and platforms. Our review and analysis suggest that although a common and open platform for sharing technical data can mitigate risks and enable efficiency, fewer benefits are likely to be realized from sharing detailed financial data. We also recommend codesigning practices with each stakeholder group, increasing legal protections for end users of electricity and using deep qualitative data in addition to quantitative metrics.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 _not_human_observation_response_data",10.1109/JPROC.2019.2919306,MOBILE PHONES;ENERGY;SYSTEMS;Information Dissemination;Privacy,,,3 _not_human_observation_response_data,,Excluded,Excluded,1

This study sought to explore relevant experiences, contextual, and subjective explanations around the topic to provide a rich and detailed presentation of what it means to different stakeholders and contexts to share data and how that can guide practice and ethical guidance. A qualitative design involving interviews was undertaken with professionals working in public health institutions endowed with data (HDSS), ethics committees, and advisory agencies which help shape health research in Africa. A descriptive form of thematic analysis was used to summarize results into six key themes: (1) The role of HDSSs in research using public health data and data-sharing; (2) Ownership and funding are critical factors influencing data-sharing; (3) Other factors discourage data-sharing; (4) Promoting and sustaining data-sharing; (5) Ethical guidance structures; and (6) Establishing effective guidance. The themes reveal factors regarding the willingness or not to share and an intricate ethical system that current discourse could reflect.

Compared to other methods, the RST approach has the advantage of combining both qualitative and quantitative information in the decision analysis, which is extremely important for CRM. Automated decision support for CRM has been proposed in recent years. However, little work has been devoted to the development of computer-based systems to support CRM in rule induction. This paper presents a novel rough set based algorithm for automated decision support for CRM. Particularly, the approach is capable to handle real numbers instead of integer numbers through introduction of converted numbers involving tolerances. Being unique and useful in solving CRM problems, an alternative rule extraction algorithm (AREA) is presented for discovering preference-based rules according to the reducts which contain the maximum of strength index (SI) in the same case, where the data with tolerance. The empirical data set associated with CRM has proven the validity and reliability of these approaches. This research thus contributes to developing and validating a useful approach to automated decision support for CRM.

Design/methodology/approach This paper is based on a qualitative study of 105 researchers from three disciplinary communities: quantitative social science, archaeology and zoology. The study focused on researchers' most recent data reuse experience, particularly what they needed when deciding whether to reuse data. Findings Findings show that researchers mentioned 12 types of context information across three broad categories: data production information (data collection, specimen and artifact, data producer, data analysis, missing data, and research objectives); repository information (provenance, reputation and history, curation and digitization); and data reuse information (prior reuse, advice on reuse and terms of use). Originality/value This paper extends digital curation conversations to include the preservation of context as well as content to facilitate data reuse. When compared to prior research, findings show that there is some generalizability with respect to the types of context needed across different disciplines and data sharing and reuse environments. It also introduces several new context types. Relying on the perspective of researchers offers a more nuanced view that shows the importance of the different context types for each discipline and the ways disciplinary members thought about them. Both data producers and curators can benefit from knowing what to capture and manage during data collection and deposit into a repository.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Included"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Included""""}",10.1108/JD-08-2018-0133,KNOWLEDGE;METADATA,,,,,Included,Included,1

The goal of this mixed-methods study is to understand how knowledge sharing and brokerage regarding data use and an educational problem changed over time. Social network data were collected twice at eight schools. These data were used to analyse (1) how well team members were connected with each other (density), (2) whether team members' relationships were mutual (reciprocity) and (3) whether all team members were equally important for the data team network (centralisation). Moreover, different types of knowledge brokering (inward, outward and forward) were examined to further understand knowledge exchange between data team members and their colleagues. Qualitative data were analysed to triangulate these findings for four particular cases. Among other things, findings illustrated that while knowledge sharing and knowledge brokerage both changed over time, there were considerable differences between teams in the extent and direction of change. It appeared that the dissemination of knowledge within the organisation requires more explicit attention.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using,4_not_prerequisites_barriers_facilitators_",10.1080/02671522.2017.1286682,TEACHER COLLABORATION;DISTRICT;IMPROVEMENT;LEADERS;POLICY,,,"1 not sharing/ not using,4_not_prerequisites_barriers_facilitators_",,Excluded,Excluded,1

The classification of discrete functional zones and qualitative recognition of UFZs have been well studied, but the precise recognition of UFZs with explicit depictions of socioeconomic urban functions has seldom been addressed. Thus, we propose a novel open-source data-guided semantic urban function recognition (OSD-SFR) framework to analyze UFZs and quantitatively link open-source data (OSD) with the Chinese national urban function classification code. The spatial relationship between the combined semantic database and the segmented urban zones data set was measured, graded, and categorized. Kernel density and statistical methods based on a single data source of points-of interest were used for comparative experiments. The results indicate that OSD-SFR yields more fine-grained delineations between urban functions and achieves more accurate recognition. Critical semantic information from different OSD sources is deeply integrated. This study provides a realistic reference, including detailed descriptions of the spatial distribution and morphological structure of UFZs, to support long-term city planning.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 _not_human_observation_response_data",10.1111/tgis.12736     EA JUN 2021,VOLUNTEERED GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION;SOCIAL MEDIA DATA;MOBILE PHONE;REGIONS;URBANIZATION;SEGMENTATION;LANDSCAPE;NETWORK;IMAGERY;POINTS;Semantics,,,3 _not_human_observation_response_data,,Excluded,Excluded,1

However, the existence of systemic contradictions hinders the sharing of health data and such collectivist endeavor. Therefore, this qualitative study explores these systemic barriers to a fair sharing of health data from the perspectives of Swiss stakeholders.        Methods: Purposive and snowball sampling were used to recruit 48 experts active in the Swiss healthcare domain, from the research/policy-making field and those having a high position in a health data enterprise (e.g., health register, hospital IT data infrastructure or a national health data initiative). Semi-structured interviews were then conducted, audio-recorded, verbatim transcribed with identifying information removed to guarantee the anonymity of participants. A theoretical thematic analysis was then carried out to identify themes and subthemes related to the topic of systemic fairness for sharing health data.        Results: Two themes related to the topic of systemic fairness for sharing health data were identified, namely (i) the hypercompetitive environment and (ii) the legal uncertainty blocking data sharing. The theme, hypercompetitive environment was further divided into two subthemes, (i) systemic contradictions to fair data sharing and the (ii) need of fair systemic attribution mechanisms.        Discussion: From the perspectives of Swiss stakeholders, hypercompetition in the Swiss academic system is hindering the sharing of health data for secondary research purposes, with the downside effect of influencing researchers to embrace individualism for career opportunities, thereby opposing the data sharing movement. In addition, there was a perceived sense of legal uncertainty from legislations governing the sharing of health data, which adds unreasonable burdens on individual researchers, who are often unequipped to deal with such facets of their data sharing activities.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health",10.3389/fpubh.2021.669463,INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE,,,5_adresses_government_health,,Excluded,Excluded,1

Nevertheless, the lack of potable water in some regions and the continuous degradation of farmable lands call for intervention through effective policy formulation and implementation. In this work, we present a conceptual workflow as a strategic step towards developing a framework for a data-driven soil and water resources management policy. A review of the current legal and policy framework and selected scientific literature on soil and water resources in Nigeria is presented. Analysis of the National Water Resources Bill proposed in 2018 is used to highlight existing gaps between policy, scientific data and reality. Modern field techniques and project-based examples for soil and aquifer characterization that can be adapted for local use are presented.

Design/methodology/approach The study employed 10 semi-structured interviews with data managers at a state geological survey and qualitative analysis of the interview transcripts. Findings The Designated Community for a collection in this data repository has evolved from petroleum industry users to include academic researchers and the public. This change was accompanied by significant user interaction changes from in-person, reference interview-style conversations to anonymous digital, automated interactions. The main factors driving these changes were developments in technology which allowed the data managers to shift data discovery and access into the online environment. The online data portal has seen increasing non-expert use, driving the data team to develop additional services for these new communities. Repository data team participants varied in their familiarity with the FAIR Principles and their perceptions of the FAIRness of the data in the repository.

A system dynamics (SD)-based decision support system (DSS) is developed and analysed for this purpose. System dynamics was used as the modelling tool because of its rigorous approach in capturing interrelationships among variables and in handling dynamic aspects of the system behaviour. A qualitative model is first formulated to understand the present state of the DW diffusion. The quantitative model is then formulated to simulate seven management policies. Findings unearth two dominant policies of 'increase level of training' and 'decrease training delay' that will speed up the diffusion significantly. None of the policies, however, achieve the bank's target diffusion level within a specified time period. Sensitivity analyses reveal various combinations of the dominant policies that the management can adopt. The analyses act as an eye-opener for the bank executives as they understand what can be feasibly achieved given a number of constraints.

However, among Congolese women aged 15-49, the prevalence of MC use is low. Research suggests that women's general participation in decision-making is important in increasing MC use. However, little is known about the specific role of women's decision-making power over their own health care and how it relates to MC use. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the relationship between women's decision-making power over their own health care and use of MC. Methods A cross-sectional secondary data analysis was conducted using the most recent data from the 2013-2014 Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) Demographic and Health Survey. Women who were considered in need of contraception based on their family planning preferences were included in the study population (N = 6422). Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine whether women's decision-making power over their own health care was associated with the use of MC. Results Only one in ten women reported using a modern method of contraception. Logistic regression showed that women who made decisions alone regarding their own health care were more likely to use MC than women who had no say in these decisions, even after controlling for important covariates (OR 1.48; 95% CI 1.00, 2.17). Conclusion The results of this study lend further support that promoting women's autonomy and right to independently make decisions regarding their own health may be important in increasing the use of MC in the DRC. However, in order to effectively empower women to negotiate for the use of MC, qualitative research is needed to further assess the relationship between decision-making power and MC use.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health",10.1186/s12905-021-01450-x,EPIDEMIOLOGY;AUTONOMY;Cesarean Section,,,5_adresses_government_health,,Excluded,Excluded,1

Methods: A semi-qualitative cross-sectional study was used which entailed analysing miners' personal health records from 2014 to 2018. Data were accessed from the audiometry medical surveillance database (n = 480), the hearing screening database (n = 24,321), and the occupational hygiene database (n = 15,769). Ethical principles were applied to demonstrate big data protection and sharing. Results: Some audiometry screening and occupational hygiene records were incomplete and/or inaccurate (N = 4675). The database containing medical disease and treatment records could not be accessed. Ethical challenges included a lack of clarity regarding permission rights when sharing big data, and no policy governing the divulgence of miners' personal and medical records for research. Conclusion: This case study illustrates how research can be effectively, although not maliciously, obstructed by the strict protection of employee medical data.

Given the inefficiencies and biases of traditional manual, static and qualitative risk management practices, research has progressed to using data analytics to objectively and dynamically manage risks. However, the variety of operational risks, techniques and objectives researched is not well mapped across industries. This paper thoroughly reviews the emerging research area applying data analytics to operational risk management (ORM) within financial services (FS) and energy and natural resources (ENR). A systematic literature search resulted in 2,538 publications, from which detailed bibliometric and content analyses are performed on 191 studies of relevance. The literature is classified using a novel multi-layered framework, informing critical analyses of the analytics techniques and data employed. Five core themes emerge, relevant to practitioners, researchers, educators and students across any sector: risk identification, causal factors, risk quantification, risk prediction and risk decision-making. Generally, ENR studies focus on identifying causal factors and predicting specific incidents, whereas FS applications are more mature surrounding risk quantification. To conclude, the comprehensive review reveals areas where further research is needed to advance ORM within and beyond FS and ENR, in pursuit of improved decision-making.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using",10.1080/01605682.2022.2041373     EA FEB 2022,ORGANIZATIONAL-FACTORS;MINING TECHNIQUES;HUMAN ERROR;ACCIDENTS;MODELS;OIL;Risk Management,,,1 not sharing/ not using,,Excluded,Excluded,1

Shawn","",English,EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,"750 FIRST ST, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA","Numerous studies have demonstrated that regularly playing action video games (AVGPs) is associated with increased cognitive performance. Individuals who play role-playing video games (RPGs) have usually been excluded from these studies. This is because RPGs traditionally contained no action components and were thus not expected to influence cognitive performance. However, modern RPGs increasingly include numerous action-like components. We therefore examined whether current RPG players (RPGPs) perform similar to action video game players (AVGPs) or nonvideo game players (NVGPs) on two cognitive tasks. Self-identified AVGPs (N = 76), NVGPs (N = 77), and RPGPs (N = 23) completed two online cognitive tasks: A useful field of view (UFOV) task and a multiple-object tracking task (MOT). The UFOV task measures the ability to deploy visuospatial attention over a large field of view while dividing one's attention between a central and a peripheral task. The MOT task measures the ability to use attentional control to dynamically refresh information in working memory. RPGPs performed similar to AVGPs and better than NVGPs on both tasks. However, patterns of covariation (e.g., gender and age) presented obstacles to interpretation in some cases. Our study is the first to demonstrate that RPGPs show similar cognitive performance to AVGPs. These findings suggest that regularly playing modern RPGs may enhance visuospatial abilities. However, because the current study was purely cross-sectional, intervention studies will be needed to assess causation. We discuss the implications of this finding, as well as considerations for how gamers are classified going forward.        Public Policy Relevance Statement        We investigate whether individuals who play action video games that are mostly first- or third-person shooter games, as well as individuals who play action role-playing games, differ in their cognitive abilities as compared with nonvideo game players. We demonstrate that both action and role-playing gamers outperform nongamers on two attentionally demanding tasks and perform similarly to each other, suggesting that games other than those traditionally placed in the """"action"""" genre may be beneficial for cognitive performance.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using",10.1037/ppm0000237,MULTIPLE-OBJECT TRACKING;SHORT-TERM-MEMORY;ATTENTIONAL CONTROL;SPATIAL SKILLS;VISUAL-SEARCH;PERFORMANCE;EXPERIENCE;TASK;AGE;REPRESENTATION;Cognition,,,1 not sharing/ not using,,Excluded,Excluded,1

The approach offers a way to capture motion adapted from the film industry in which markers placed on the skin of the face can be tracked with a pattern-matching algorithm. The method records and postprocesses raw facial movement data (coordinates per frame) of distinctly placed markers and is intended for use in facial expression research (e.g., microexpressions) in laboratory settings. Due to the explicit use of specifically placed, artificial markers, the procedure offers the simultaneous measurement of several emotionally relevant markers in a (psychometrically) objective and artifact-free way, even for facial regions without natural landmarks (e.g., the cheeks). In addition, the proposed procedure is fully based on open-source software and is transparent at every step of data processing. Two worked examples demonstrate the practicability of the proposed procedure: In Study 1(N=39), the participants were instructed to show the emotions happiness, sadness, disgust, and anger, and in Study 2 (N=113), they were asked to present both a neutral face and the emotions happiness, disgust, and fear. Study 2 involved the simultaneous tracking of 14 markers for approximately 12 min per participant with a time resolution of 33 ms. The measured facial movements corresponded closely to the assumptions of established measurement instruments (EMFACS, FACSAID, Friesen & Ekman, 1983; Ekman & Hager, 2002). In addition, the measurement was found to be very precise with sub-second, sub-pixel, and sub-millimeter accuracy.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 _not_qualitative/_video_data_",10.3758/s13428-018-1085-9,RECOGNITION;DELIBERATE;FACES;LIES;Software,,,2 _not_qualitative/_video_data_,,Excluded,Excluded,1

Specifically, it studies how privacy literacy influences privacy-related risk perceptions concerning the usage of personal information on social networks, and the relationship between the user's privacy concerns and their sharing behavior on social media. The privacy paradox concept is evaluated in this context with respect to the ambiguous values and perceptions that social network users have, wherein they experience concerns regarding their privacy in specific environments but continue to share their information and personal content via these channels regardless. The research adopts a qualitative exploratory approach using semi-structured interviews and content analysis, with Facebook as the focal social network. Four categorical headlines are identified, supporting specific findings that indicate that risk perceptions concerning privacy do impact users' privacy concerns, but do not influence individuals to reduce sharing data. Thus, although some users perceive risks involved in these practices, they continue to share data, ignoring the fact that this may be to their detriment and instead focusing on characteristics that support their sharing. The findings indicate that social interaction benefits obtained from social, hedonic and utilitarian elements provided via the social network lead users to take risks regarding online self-exposure based on their desires and social values.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using",10.1093/iwc/iwad027     EA MAR 2023,INFORMATION DISCLOSURE;CONSUMPTION EXPERIENCE;SELF-DISCLOSURE;PARADOX;FACEBOOK;ANTECEDENTS;ATTITUDES;CALCULUS;BEHAVIOR;SITES;Social Support;Information Dissemination;Privacy,,,1 not sharing/ not using,,Excluded,Excluded,1

Up to now, such video stimuli have been mostly controlled only for some of the technical aspects of the video material (e.g., duration of clips, encoding, framerate, etc.), leaving open the possibility that systematic differences in video stimulus materials may be concealed in the actual motion properties of the actor's movements. Computer vision methods such as OpenPose enable the fitting of body-pose models to the consecutive frames of a video clip and thereby make it possible to recover the movements performed by the actor in a particular video clip without the use of a point-based or markerless motion-tracking system during recording. The OpenPoseR package provides a straightforward and reproducible way of working with these body-pose model data extracted from video clips using OpenPose, allowing researchers in the fields of sign language and gesture studies to quantify the amount of motion (velocity and acceleration) pertaining only to the movements performed by the actor in a video clip. These quantitative measures can be used for controlling differences in the movements of an actor in stimulus video clips or, for example, between different conditions of an experiment.

However, sharing is based on the assumption that the donor has given consent to a given use of her or his simple. Biobanking stakeholders, therefore, must choose 1 of 3 options: obtain general consent enabling multiple future uses before taking a sample from the donor, try to obtain consent again before sharing a previously obtained sample, or look for a legally endorsed way to share a sample without the donor's consent. In this study, we present the results of 36 semistructured qualitative interviews with Swiss biobanking stakeholders regarding these options and the role of ethics committees in the process of authorizing sharing. Our results show that despite a lack of legal or guideline-based barriers to general consent, some stakeholders and ethics committees have reservations about this method of consent. In most cases, however, a general consent form is already in use. Many interviewees describe processes involving the ethics committees as time-consuming and cumbersome and their requirements as too demanding for donors/patients. Greater awareness of donors' opinions and preferences and the content of guidelines and recommendations could therefore be helpful for a better justified perspective of biobanking stakeholders and ethical committee members, equally. Finally, it may be necessary to differentiate between procedures governing future samples, where general consent is clearly desirable, and the use of old yet still relevant samples, where the option of using them without consent can be highly beneficial for research.

This question is pressing as technologies transform children's lives into data which is recorded, tracked, aggregated, analysed and monetized. This article takes a child-centred, qualitative approach to charting the nature and limits of children's understanding of privacy in digital contexts. We conducted focus group interviews with 169 UK children aged 11-16 to explore their understanding of privacy in three distinct digital contexts-interpersonal, institutional and commercial. We find, first, that children primarily conceptualize privacy in relation to interpersonal contexts, conceiving of personal information as something they have agency and control over as regards deciding when and with whom to share it, even if they do not always exercise such control. This leads them to some misapprehensions about how personal data is collected, inferred and used by organizations, be these public institutions such as their schools or commercial businesses. Children's expectation of agency in interpersonal contexts, and their tendency to trust familiar institutions such as their schools, make for a doubly problematic orientation towards data and privacy online in commercial contexts, leading to a mix of frustration, misapprehension and risk. We argue that, since the complexity of the digital environment challenges teachers' capacity to address children's knowledge gaps, businesses, educators, parents and the state must exercise a shared responsibility to create a legible, transparent and privacy-respecting digital environment in which children can exercise genuine choice and agency.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using",10.17645/mac.v8i4.3407,Only Child;Child;Privacy,,,1 not sharing/ not using,,Excluded,Excluded,1

Objective: We sought to design a system to support the fidelity of intervention delivery and efficient capture of qualitative and quantitative process data for a telephone-delivered behavioral counseling intervention to increase physical activity and function after total knee replacement surgery.        Methods: A tailored system was designed to prompt the intervention coach in the delivery of a 5 step counseling protocol to support intervention fidelity across patients. System features included structured data components, automated data exchange functions, user-friendly data capture screens, and real-time surveillance reporting. The system structured the capture of patient goals and open-ended conversation.        Results: The system recorded intervention process data from each of 12 sessions held with the 92 intervention patients. During the trial, 992 telephone sessions were conducted, and more than 97% (4816/4960) of intervention process data fields were completed in the system.

Accordingly, more research is necessary to prove the validity of the approach and to assure its larger replicability.        Practical implications - Implications for the agenda of organizations and destinations' makers for designing and implementing knowledge-based services and products arise.        Originality/value - Elements of originality reside into the adoption of CKM as framework to analyze Big Data in the tourism industry.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health",10.1108/K-07-2017-0273,GROUNDED THEORY;SOCIAL MEDIA;ANALYTICS;DESTINATION;TECHNOLOGY;CHALLENGES;INNOVATION;IMPACT;OPPORTUNITIES;INTELLIGENCE,,,5_adresses_government_health,,Excluded,Excluded,1

Thirty-six consumers were given a list of 11 products and asked to think-aloud while selecting (i) a product they usually buy and (ii) a product they use for weight management. After the consecutive shopping tasks, the subjects were interviewed and asked to answer a nutrition knowledge questionnaire. The subjects were categorized by the difference in the energy contents of their selections and the food selection criteria. The energy contents of the selections for weight management were reduced by 10-46%. Ten subjects with the greatest difference between the energy contents of their selections had higher level in nutrition knowledge and mentioned less nutritional issues during the selections than ten subjects with the smallest such differences. Taste was an important product selection criterion by the former group, while the latter focused primarily on price. Nutrition knowledge is interrelated with personal factors and selection goals.

To describe the frequency of pressure ulcer risk assessment in pediatric patients and pressure ulcer prevention intervention use overall and by hospital unit type, a descriptive secondary analysis was performed of data submitted to the National Database for Nursing Quality Indicators ((R)) (NDNQI((R))) for at least 3 of the 4 quarters in 2012. Relevant data on pressure ulcer risk from 271 hospitals across the United States extracted from the NDNQI database included patient skin and pressure ulcer risk assessment on admission, time since the last pressure ulcer risk assessment, method used to assess pressure ulcer risk, and risk status. Extracted data on pressure ulcer prevention included skin assessment, pressure-redistribution surface use, routine repositioning, nutritional support, and moisture management. These data were organized by unit type and merged with data on hospital characteristics for the analysis. The sample included 39 984 patients ages 1 day to 18 years on 678 pediatric acute care units (general pediatrics, pediatric critical care units, neonatal intensive care units, pediatric step-down units, and pediatric rehabilitation units). Descriptive statistics were used to analyze study data. Most of the pediatric patients (33 644; 89.2%) were assessed for pressure ulcer risk within 24 hours of admission. The Braden Q Scale was frequently used to assess risk on general pediatrics units (75.4%), pediatric step-down units (85.5%), pediatric critical care units (81.3%), and pediatric rehabilitation units (56.1%). In the neonatal intensive care units, another scale or method was used more often (55% to 60%) to assess pressure ulcer risk. Of the 11 203 pediatric patients (39%) determined to be at risk for pressure ulcers, the majority (10 741, 95.8%) received some kind of pressure ulcer prevention intervention during the 24 hours preceding the NDNQI pressure ulcer survey. The frequency of prevention intervention use among those at risk ranged from 99.2% for skin assessment to 70.7% for redistribution surface use. Most pediatric patients are being assessed for pressure ulcer risk, but the implementation of interventions to prevent pressure ulcers among children needs to be improved. Future qualitative research should be conducted to determine how and when clinical judgment is used to assess pressure ulcer risk and the type of pressure-redistribution surfaces used among younger pediatric patients.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health","","INTENSIVE-CARE;Pressure Ulcer;Quality Indicators, Health Care",,,5_adresses_government_health,,Excluded,Excluded,1

This paper therefore provides a consolidated overview of the open data arena that allows readers to identify well-established topics, trends, and open research issues. Additionally, we provide an extensive qualitative discussion of the most interesting findings to pave the way for future research. Our first identification phase resulted in 893 relevant peer-reviewed articles, published between 2006 and 2019 in a wide variety of venues. Analysis of the results shows that open data research grew slowly from 2006 but increased significantly as from 2009. In 2019, research interest in open data from a technological perspective overall decreased. This fact could indicate that research is beginning to stabilise, i.e., the open data research hype is over, and the research field is reaching maturity. Main findings are (i) increasing effort in researching on Semantic Web technologies as a mechanism to publish and reuse linked open data, (ii) software systems are proposed to solve open data technical problems; and (iii) considering technological aspects of legislation and standardization is needed to widely introduce open data in society. Finally, we provide complementary insights regarding open data innovation projects, with special emphasis on publication (e.g., open data portals) and consumption (e.g., open data as business enabler) of open data.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health,2 _not_qualitative/_video_data_",10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3052025,"",,,"5_adresses_government_health,2 _not_qualitative/_video_data_",,Excluded,Excluded,1

The data contained in primary care records are uniquely comprehensive.        Aim To explore the knowledge and attitudes of patients and members of the primary healthcare team regarding the sharing of data held in primary care records, with particular reference to data sharing for research and the impact that this may have on trust between patients and health professionals.        Design of study Qualitative study using quota sampled, semi-structured interviews.        Setting Five general practices in Leicestershire, UK.        Method Grounded theory and framework methodology were used. Interviews were transcribed and analysed thematically.        Results Twenty patients and 15 healthcare professionals and managers were interviewed. Patients had limited knowledge of the type of information held in their general practice records and the ways in which these data are shared, but appeared ready to form preliminary views on issues such as data sharing for audit and disease registration. In this climate of limited awareness, there was no suggestion that concern about data sharing for research adversely affects patient trust or leads patients to withhold relevant information from health professionals in primary care. Interviews carried out with staff suggested a lack of clear practice policies regarding data sharing.        Conclusions General practices may need to develop policies on data sharing, bring these to the attention of their patient population and improve patient awareness about the nature of the data contained in their records. Researchers should ensure that patients are adequately informed about the nature of data contained in patient records when seeking consent for data extraction.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health","",INFORMED-CONSENT;CONFIDENTIALITY;INFORMATION;STRATEGIES;REGISTRY;RECORDS;DEBATE;THREAT;Privacy,,,5_adresses_government_health,,Excluded,Excluded,1

Accurate interpretation of quantitative and qualitative compliance data is critical for determining which compliance activities contribute to specific management outcomes. To demonstrate the value of enforcement data in effective MPA management, more than 5000 enforcement actions from 2007 to 2013 from five New South Wales (NSW) Marine Parks were analysed. Specifically, it was tested whether through time: (i) the number of enforcement actions standardised by surveillance effort declined-indicating that 'general deterrence' was being achieved; (ii) the number of repeat offenders decreased-indicating that 'specific deterrence' was being achieved; (iii) the number of 'local community' enforcement actions standardised by surveillance effort declined-indicating growing support for marine parks was being achieved at the community level; and (iv) the percentage of young offenders (<25 yr) had declined-indicating that education programs targeting young adults were successful. Results indicated that general deterrence was not being achieved, with offence rates being relatively stable between years. In contrast, compliance measures were achieving individual deterrence, with the percentage of repeat offenders being very low (0.13-0.83%). Although compliance strategies may be making some progress in improving local compliance in some marine parks, the overall offence rate of local communities was concerning. The data suggested that there were major differences in compliance rates among age groups of offenders over time, although the percentage of young offenders declined over time in three marine parks. Over the six-year data collection period, there was no discernable improvement in compliance rates in most NSW Marine Parks. Overall, the significant value of collecting and analysing information on enforcement activities for MPAs was demonstrated, an often neglected aspect of their management world-wide.

While the performance of OGD initiatives (POI) in some agencies has been impressive, for others it has been less so. To understand the underlying factors that influence OGD initiatives and drawing on the technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework, we propose a model that incorporates seven context-specific TOE variables. The model was tested with two complementary methods applied to responses in 198 surveys completed by Australian government agency employees. In the first stage, structural equation modeling detected that quality of data, management leadership, skilled operational professionals, political commitment, and external pressure significantly contribute to POI. However, the concept of the TOE framework fundamentally implies a joint effect, suggesting a configuration rather than independent effect of TOE variables. Therefore, in the second stage, we investigated the model using fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), which is new to information systems research and appropriate for configuration analyses. The fsQCA results suggested complex configurational trade-off effects among the variables. Specifically, quality of data and metadata, management leadership, skilled operational professionals, and political commitment were found to drive POI. Inhibitors of POI included lack of skilled staff, lack of technology infrastructure, lack of political commitment, and external pressure. Our findings contribute to the information systems literature and managerial practice by providing strategic insight to improve OGD initiatives.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health",10.1080/10919392.2021.2018258     EA JAN 2022,OF-THE-ART;USER ACCEPTANCE;ADOPTION;QUALITY;TRANSPARENCY;DETERMINANTS;TECHNOLOGY;INNOVATION;USABILITY;DIFFUSION;Fibrinogen,,,5_adresses_government_health,,Excluded,Excluded,1

Data were collected from April 21 to August 7, 2017, using 24-question online survey (5 demographic, 19 content questions (single/multiple choice and Likert scale type). Bivariate (ANOVA) and multivariate methods (clustering) were used. Findings The authors identified three perception-related and four behavior-related connections; this gave three clusters per area. First, perceptions - skeptical group, mainly social (SocS) and natural sciences (NatS): no clear RDM and ethical issues standpoints, do not agree that every university needs a data management plan (DMP). Careful group, again including mainly SocS and NatS: RDM is problematic and linked to ethical dilemmas, positive toward institutional DMPs. Convinced group, mainly from humanities (HUM), NatS, engineering (ENG) and medicine and health sciences (MedHeS): no problems regarding RDM, agrees this is an ethical question, is positive toward institutional DMP's. Second, behaviors - sparse group, mainly from MedHeS, NatS and HUM, some agricultural scientists (AgS), and some SocS and ENG: do not tag data sets with metadata, do not use file-naming conventions/standards. Frequent group - many ENG, SocS, moderate numbers of NatS, very few AgS and only a few MedHeS and HUM: often use file-naming conventions/standards, version-control systems, have experience with public-domain data, are reluctant to use metadata with their RD. Slender group, mainly from AgS and NatS, moderate numbers of ENG, SocS and HUM, but no MedHeS: often use public-domain data, other three activities are rare. Research limitations/implications Research could be expanded to a wider population, include other stakeholders and use qualitative methods. Practical implications Results are useful for international comparisons but also give foundations and recommendations on institutional and national RDM and RDL policies, implementations, and how to bring academic libraries into the picture. Identified differences suggest that different educational, awareness-raising and participatory approaches are needed for each group.

Software documentation for these libraries is crucial in helping programmers/analysts know what libraries are available and how to use them. Yet documentation for open source software libraries is widely considered low-quality. This article is a collaboration between CSCW researchers and contributors to data analytics OSS libraries, based on ethnographic fieldwork and qualitative interviews. We examine several issues around the formats, practices, and challenges around documentation in these largely volunteer-based projects. There are many different kinds and formats of documentation that exist around such libraries, which play a variety of educational, promotional, and organizational roles. The work behind documentation is similarly multifaceted, including writing, reviewing, maintaining, and organizing documentation. Different aspects of documentation work require contributors to have different sets of skills and overcome various social and technical barriers. Finally, most of our interviewees do not report high levels of intrinsic enjoyment for doing documentation work (compared to writing code). Their motivation is affected by personal and project-specific factors, such as the perceived level of credit for doing documentation work versus more 'technical' tasks like adding new features or fixing bugs. In studying documentation work for data analytics OSS libraries, we gain a new window into the changing practices of data-intensive research, as well as help practitioners better understand how to support this often invisible and infrastructural work in their projects.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 _not_human_observation_response_data",10.1007/s10606-018-9333-1,ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS;WORK;Software,,,3 _not_human_observation_response_data,,Excluded,Excluded,1

Vast quantities of born-digital data are being produced in a wide variety of forms at a rapid rate in universities. This paper analyses the contribution of academic libraries to research data management (RDM) in the wider institutional context. In particular it: examines the roles and relationships involved in RDM, identifies the main components of an RDM programme, evaluates the major drivers for RDM activities, and analyses the key factors influencing the shape of RDM developments. The study is written from the perspective of library professionals, analysing data from 26 semi-structured interviews of library staff from different UK institutions. This is an early qualitative contribution to the topic complementing existing quantitative and case study approaches. Results show that although libraries are playing a significant role in RDM, there is uncertainty and variation in the relationship with other stakeholders such as ITservices and research support offices. Current emphases in RDM programmes are on developments of policies and guidelines, with some early work on technology infrastructures and support services. Drivers for developments include storage, security, quality, compliance, preservation, and sharing with libraries associated most closely with the last three. The paper also highlights a 'jurisdictional' driver in which libraries are claiming a role in this space. A wide range of factors, including governance, resourcing and skills, are identified as influencing ongoing developments. From the analysis, a model is constructed designed to capture the main aspects of an institutional RDM programme. This model helps to clarify the different issues involved in RDM, identifying layers of activity, multiple stakeholders and drivers, and a large number of factors influencing the implementation of any initiative. Institutions may usefully benchmark their activities against the data and model in order to inform ongoing RDM activity.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 4_not_prerequisites_barriers_facilitators_",10.1371/journal.pone.0114734,SERVICES,,,4_not_prerequisites_barriers_facilitators_,,Excluded,Excluded,1

Design/methodology/approach This study is based on the qualitative approach and uses a single case (in-depth investigation approach) study to come up with a data-driven theory, which is usable in the context of organizational change management and organizational ambidexterity (OA). Besides, in-depth interviews of change management practitioners, this study uses various sources of secondary information. Findings The study finds that owing to the reactive, ad hoc, and discontinuous nature of change often triggered by external factors or internal crisis within the organization, an organization need to continually engage with the existing data. The outcome must be driven toward preparing for the change through data engagement, implementation and reinforcement. The authors found that in order to be successful it is essential to have a strategy, set-up the right operating model, be clear on the scope of the change management work-stream and continuously monitor the progress through defined milestones and acceptance criteria. For companies targeting to achieve competitive differentiation through ambidexterity, a well-grounded change management program is the key for the success. Originality/value The study suggests that there is little work combining organizational change management and OA from a practitioner's point of view. Accordingly, the authors propose a new data-driven organizational change management theory, which the authors term as the tripod theory for organizational change management. A practitioner's perspective on the topic using a case study of an insurance company's data transformation and a framework for structuring the change management program makes a meaningful contribution to the existing literature.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 _not_human_observation_response_data",10.1108/MD-07-2018-0841,BIG DATA;EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE;PERFORMANCE;EXPLORATION;EXPLOITATION;TECHNOLOGY;EXPERIENCE;INNOVATION;EFFICIENCY;FRAMEWORK;Organizational Innovation;Functional Laterality,,,3 _not_human_observation_response_data,,Excluded,Excluded,1

This article asks: (1) who is using municipal open government data resources and for what purposes? and (2) what impact are municipal open government data having in cities where they have been implemented? We performed a qualitative analysis of 26 semi-structured telephone interviews conducted with government staff, civic technologists, and private sector stakeholders in nine cities around the United States. Each of these 30 to 45-minute telephone interviews were transcribed and analyzed to distill insights regarding the use and impact of municipal open government data in the nine cities considered. We find that the array of actors within open government data ecosystems at the local level is expanding as distinctions between the public and private sectors becomes increasingly blurred and that the demands of managing and sustaining these initiatives has led to changes in the services offered by local government, as well as in the duties of government staff. The impact of these data resources has been primarily felt within local government itself, although the lack of monitoring mechanisms makes it difficult to systematically evaluate their broader effects. We conclude that open government data initiatives should be coordinated and better integrated with digital equity and digital inclusion efforts in order to advance their political and social goals.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health",10.1016/j.tele.2020.101526,OPEN GOVERNMENT DATA;OPEN DATA PORTALS;CITIES;AGE,,,5_adresses_government_health,,Excluded,Excluded,1

Unfortunately, errors cannot be completely prevented and 100% safety can never be achieved. Therefore, in addition to error reduction strategies, health care organisations could also implement strategies that promote timely error detection and correction. Reporting and analysis of so-called near misses - usually defined as incidents without adverse consequences for patients - are necessary to gather information about successful error recovery mechanisms. This study establishes the need for a clearer and more consistent definition of near misses to enable large-scale reporting and analysis in order to obtain such information. Qualitative incident reports and interviews were collected on four units of two Dutch general hospitals. Analysis of the 143 accompanying error handling processes demonstrated that different incident types each provide unique information about error handling. Specifically, error handling processes underlying incidents that did not reach the patient differed significantly from those of incidents that reached the patient, irrespective of harm, because of successful countermeasures that had been taken after error detection. We put forward two possible definitions of near misses and argue that, from a practical point of view, the optimal definition may be contingent on organisational context. Both proposed definitions could yield large-scale reporting of near misses. Subsequent analysis could enable health care organisations to improve the safety and quality of care proactively by (1) eliminating failure factors before real accidents occur, (2) enhancing their ability to intercept errors in time, and (3) improving their safety culture.

However, no systematic literature reviews (SLRs) focus on this topic. This SLR aims to gather evidence on the impact of the aforementioned system, also known as a patient data management system (PDMS) on both organizational and clinical outcomes.        Materials and Methods: A literature search was performed using the databases Medline/PubMed and CINHAL for English articles published between January 2000 and December 2012. A quality assessment was performed on articles deemed relevant for the SLR.        Results: Eighteen articles were included in the SLR. Sixteen articles investigated the impact of a PDMS on the organizational outcomes, comprising descriptive, quantitative and qualitative studies. A PDMS was found to reduce the charting time, increase the time spent on direct patient care and reduce the occurrence of errors. Only two articles investigated the clinical impact of a PDMS. Both reported an improvement in clinical outcomes when a PDMS was integrated with a clinical decision support system (CDSS).        Conclusions: A PDMS has shown to offer many advantages in both the efficiency and the quality of care delivered to the patient. In addition, a PDMS integrated to a CDSS may improve clinical outcomes, although further studies are required for validation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Design: Exploratory, mixed-methods.        Setting and Participants: We conducted a secondary analysis of data from a national survey of nursing home administrative leaders (n = 815) representing every state in the United States. Next, semi-structured interviews were used to elicit rich contextual information from (n = 12) administrators from nursing homes with varying data-sharing capabilities.        Methods: We used descriptive statistics along with Rao-Scott chi-square and logistic regression models to examine the relationship between health dataesharing capabilities and nursing home characteristics such as location, bed size, and type of ownership. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis.        Results: Of the 815 nursing homes completing the survey, 95% had computerized (electronic) medical records, and 46% had some capability for health information exchange. Nursing homes located in metropolitan areas had 2.53 (95% confidence interval = 1.53, 4.18) times greater odds for having health information exchange capability compared with nursing homes in small towns. Perceived challenges to health data sharing with residents and family members and external clinical partners include variance in systems and software, privacy and security concerns, and organizational factors slowing uptake of technology. Perceived benefits of health data sharing included improved communication, improved care planning, and anticipating future demand.        Conclusions and Implications: As health data sharing becomes more ubiquitous in acute care settings, policy makers, nursing home leaders, and other stakeholders should prepare by working to mitigate barriers and capitalize on potential benefits of implementing this technology in nursing homes.

The data collected from these key informants were then analysed using the qualitative data analysis software ATLAS.ti. Findings Value creation through big data is an important factor for enhancing performance. It has a positive impact on both tangible (organisational performance) and intangible (societal) aspects depending on the context. Oil and gas companies understand the importance of big data to creating value in their operations. However, implementing and using big data has been problematic. In this study, a framework was developed to show that factors such as the shortage of data experts, poor data quality, the risk of cyber-attacks and unsupportive organisational cultures impede its implementation and utilisation. Originality/value This study contributes to the value creation literature in the big data context.

Subjects were recruited via an e-mail list representing a wide range of academic biomedical researchers in the Pacific Northwest.        Measurements: The results from 286 survey respondents were used to provide triangulation of the qualitative analysis of data gathered from 15 semi-structured in-depth interviews.        Results: Three major themes were identified: 1) there continues to be widespread use of basic general-purpose applications for core data management; 2) there is broad perceived need for additional support in managing and analyzing large datasets; and 3) the barriers to acquiring currently available tools are most commonly related to financial burdens on small labs and unmet expectations of institutional support.        Conclusion: Themes identified in this study suggest that at least some common data management needs will best be served by improving access to basic level tools such that researchers can solve their own problems. Additionally, institutions and informaticians should focus on three components: 1) facilitate and encourage the use of modern data exchange models and standards, enabling researchers to leverage a common layer of interoperability and analysis; 2) improve the ability of researchers to maintain provenance of data and models as they evolve over time though tools and the leveraging of standards; and 3) develop and support information management service cores that could assist in these previous components while providing researchers with unique data analysis and information design support within a spectrum of informatics capabilities.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health,3 _not_human_observation_response_data",10.1197/jamia.M2114,INFORMATICS;BEHAVIOR,,,"5_adresses_government_health,3 _not_human_observation_response_data",,Excluded,Excluded,1

For this reason, experts should agree on, prioritize and identify key topics for a medium-term strategy of the German Network for Health Services Research and classify the general development of digital health in the context of health services research. Methods Between April and September 2018, the working groups """"Digital Health"""" and """"Validation and Linkage of Secondary Data"""" of the German Network for Health Services Research were asked to submit their expertise online using the methodological approach of a Delphi study. For this purpose, a multi-stage modified Delphi method with quantitative and qualitative approaches was chosen. Initially, a list of theses was drawn from the network's published position papers on digital health applications and medical apps. A total of 131 statements were formulated. The final survey instrument included questions on the biographical background of the participants, 42 developed items (33 statements and 8 open-ended questions), and one free-text field to add further aspects. Items were evaluated with a five-point Likert scale. A statement was accepted if the agreement rate was 75% or higher. Results Of the 110 potential participants, 50 (46%) took part in the first round and 39 (36%) in the second round of the Delphi survey.

In parallel, the diffusion of Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) that are interactive and easy to use have provided a way forward in facing extreme climatic events and the threatening hazards resulting from those. The combination of these two trends is referred to as ICT-enabled 'citizen observatories' of the environment. Nevertheless, the success of these citizen observatories hinges on the continued involvement of citizens as central actors of these initiatives. Developing strategies to (further) engage citizens requires in-depth understanding of the behavioral determinants that encourage or impede individuals to collect and share environment-related data. This paper takes the case of citizen-sensed weather data using Personal Weather Stations (PWSs) and looks at the drivers and barriers for sharing such data via online amateur weather networks. This is done employing a behavioral science lens that considers data sharing a decision and systematically investigates the influential factors that affect this decision. The analysis and findings are based on qualitative empirical research carried out in the Netherlands, United Kingdom and Italy. Subsequently, a model was developed that depicts the main drivers and barriers for citizen participation in weather observatories. This resulting model can be utilized as a tool to develop strategies for further enhancing ICT-enabled citizen participation in climatic observations and, consequently, in environmental management.

Two new models were developed to provide the framework for this knowledge repository. A design artifact, Constructivist Unifying Baccalaureate Epistemology (CUBE), was developed and tested and incorporates these models. This CUBE artifact incorporates a Semantic Web ontology and a W3C Resource Description Framework to create a concept space that offers a unified view of the discipline. The Knowledge Repository was modeled as an organic structure with the ability to evolve over time by incorporating a ranking/voting feature which enables students and faculty to add content to the knowledge base and collectively evaluate the relative weights of conceptual threads. Conceptual Clustering was used to create a concept map for traversing the Knowledge Repository. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the Knowledge Repository, a triangulated research approach was used, which cross checked results with multiple data sources and utilized qualitative and quantitative methods to validate the test instruments. The analyses included: focus groups, semistructured interviews, a questionnaire, and a quantitative exam that measured knowledge spanning multiple courses. Four classes participated during two semesters with four faculty members, using control and treatment groups. The research contrasted conventional single course instruction versus an Integrated Knowledge Repository (IKR) approach to learning. There was an average increase of 25 points in scores on a comprehensive exam for students who used the Knowledge Repository.

These wearables often come equipped with highly sophisticated biometric data (e.g. heart rate) functionalities that make the capture and sharing of such biometric data increasingly common practice. A few research studies have considered the effect that sharing biometric data has on those individuals sharing this data. However, little is known regarding the social impact of sharing this data in real-time and online. In this study, we investigate whether there is value in sharing heart rate data within social applications and whether sharing this data influences the behavior of those seeing this data.        We do so by conducting a study where the heart rate data of runners competing in a 5-km road race is shared in real-time with 140 online spectators. We collect rich quantitative data of user interaction though server logs, and a qualitative data set through interviews and online users' comments.        We then compare and contrast the behavior of online spectators who are presented with heart rate data together with contextual data, and those who are only presented with contextual data, for example, location. We also examine whether this difference is dependent on the social relation between the athletes and the spectators. Results indicate that spectators who are presented with the runners' heart rate data support the athletes more and rate the presented system more positively. These effects are dependent on the social tie between the athletes and spectators. This is one of the first studies to carry out an empirical investigation in the wild on the effects of sharing heart rate data in an online social context. In this light, in addition to supporting earlier literature, the outcomes present new insights and research directions within the sporting context.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health,4_not_prerequisites_barriers_facilitators_",10.1016/j.ijhcs.2017.03.008,CONTEXT;Sports;Information Dissemination,,,"5_adresses_government_health,4_not_prerequisites_barriers_facilitators_",,Excluded,Excluded,1

Due to structural and psychological similarities with gambling, there are fears that loot box purchasing may be associated with problematic gambling. Whilst monthly expenditure is typically modest (i.e. < $20), the distribution is highly skewed, with a small number of high-level spenders, sometimes referred to as """"whales"""". It is not known what proportion of industry profits are derived from such players, and whether they are typically wealthy individuals and/or problem gamblers. Methods: We used structured literature searches to identify surveys of gamers with open-access loot box data. The resulting datasets were aggregated, and correlations between loot box expenditure, problem gambling and earnings investigated using Spearman's rho correlations.        Results: The combined open-access data comprised 7,767 loot box purchasers (5,933 with self-report earnings). Secondary analysis of this self-report data confirmed that disproportionate revenue appears to be generated from high-level spenders: the top 5% of spenders (> $100/month) represent half of loot box revenue. Previously reported correlations between problem gambling and loot box expenditure were confirmed, with an aggregate correlation of rho = 0.34, p < .001. In contrast, there was no significant correlation between loot box spend and earnings rho = 0.02, p = .10.        Conclusion: Our secondary analysis suggests that games developers (unwittingly or not) are disproportionately profiting from moderate and high-risk gamblers, rather than high earning customers. Such patterns of spending mirror those observed with gambling revenues, and have implications for harm minimisation and ongoing policy debates around loot boxes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 4_not_prerequisites_barriers_facilitators_",10.1016/j.addbeh.2021.106851     EA FEB 2021,CONVERGENCE;INDUSTRY,,,4_not_prerequisites_barriers_facilitators_,,Excluded,Excluded,1

In the area of safety management, the concept of vertical alignment has been followed through the introduction of hierarchical structures and bidirectional communication, but horizontal alignment has been given little attention. The principal goal of this study was the assessment of horizontal alignment within an aviation organization with the use of data from safety investigations, audits and meetings in order to explore the extent to which (1) causal factors recorded in safety investigation reports comprised topics discussed by safety committees and focus areas of internal safety auditors, and (2) the agendas of safety committees include weak points revealed during safety audits. The study employed qualitative and quantitative analysis of data collected over a 6 years' period at three organizational levels. The results suggested a low horizontal alignment across the three pairs of the corresponding safety management activities within each organizational level. The findings were attributed to the inadequacy of procedures and lack of a safety information database for consistently sharing safety information, cultural factors and lack of planning for the coordination of safety management activities. The current research comprises a contribution to the literature and practice and introduces a technique to assess the intra-alignment of safety management initiatives within various organizational levels.

The research question the authors addressed is: How do logistics firms improve the supply chain performance in COVID-19 through big data and supply chain integration (SCI)? Design/methodology/approach The authors used a mixed-method approach with four rounds of data collection. A three-round survey of 323 logistics firms in 26 countries in Europe, America, and Asia was first conducted. The authors then conducted in-depth interviews with 55 logistics firms. Findings In the first quantitative study, the authors find mediational mechanisms through which big data analytics technology capability (BDATC) and SCI influence supply chain performance. In particular, BDATC and SCI are two second-order capabilities that help firms develop three first-order capabilities (i.e. proactive capabilities, reactive capabilities, and resource reconfiguration) and eventually lead to innovation capability and disaster immunity that allow firms to survive in COVID-19 and improve supply chain performance. The results of the follow-up qualitative analysis not only confirm the inferences from the quantitative analysis but also provide complementary insights into organizational culture and the institutional environment.

This paper attempts to determine important transport and socio-economic indicators from 151 urban areas and 51 countries, based on comparable, directly observable open-source data such as OpenstreetMap (OSM) and the TomTom database.AnalysisThis is the first, systematic indicator-analysis using recent, open source data from different urban areas around the world. The indicator road kilometers per person, sometimes cited as infrastructure accessibility is calculated by processing OSM data. Information on congestion levels have been taken from the TomTom database and socio-economic data from various, publicly accessible databases. Relations between indicators are identified through correlations and regression models are calibrated, quantifying the relation between transport infrastructure and performance indicators. Three sub-categories of cities with different population sizes (small cities, large cities and metropolises) are defined and studied individually. In addition, a qualitative analysis is performed, putting five different indicators into relation.Results & ConclusionsThe main results reconfirm previous findings but with a larger sample size and more comparable data. Good correlation values between infrastructure accessibility, socio-economic indicators, and congestion levels are demonstrated. It is shown that cities with higher GDP have generally built more infrastructure which in turn reduces their congestion levels. In particular, for cities with low population density (above approximately 1500 inh. Per sq.km), more roads per inhabitant lead to lower congestion levels; cities with high population density have in general lower congestion levels if the rail infrastructure per person ratio is high. Furthermore, these cities increasing railways per person is more effective in reducing congestions than increasing road length per person.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 _not_human_observation_response_data",10.1186/s12544-018-0334-4,LAND-USE;TRAFFIC CONGESTION;RAIL;EXPANSION;IMPACTS,,,3 _not_human_observation_response_data,,Excluded,Excluded,1

However, it seems that data sharing is a not fully adopted behavior among researchers. The theory of planned behavior was repeatedly applied to explain drivers of data sharing from the perspective of data donors (researchers). However, data sharing can be viewed from another perspective as well: survey participants. The research questions (RQs) for this study were as follows: 1 Does data sharing increase participant's nonresponse? 2 Does data sharing influence participant's response behavior? The purpose of this paper is to address these issues.Design/methodology/approachTo answer the RQs, a mixed methods approach was applied, consisting of a qualitative prestudy and a quantitative survey including an experimental component. The latter was a two-group setup with an intervention group (A) and a control group (B). A list-based recruiting of members of the Medical Faculty of the University of Freiburg was applied for 15 days. For exploratory data analysis of dropouts and nonresponse, we used Fisher's exact tests and binary logistic regressions.FindingsIn sum, we recorded 197 cases for Group A and 198 cases for Group B. We found no systematic group differences regarding response bias or dropout. Furthermore, we gained insights into the experiences our sample made with data sharing: half of our sample already requested data of other researchers or shared data on request of other researchers. Data repositories, however, were used less frequently: 28% of our respondents used data from repositories and 19% stored data in a repository.Originality/valueTo the authors' knowledge, their study is the first study that includes researchers as survey subjects investigating the effect of data sharing on their response patterns.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health,2 _not_qualitative/_video_data_",10.1108/JD-06-2022-0135     EA NOV 2022,ATTITUDES;PARTICIPANTS;RESEARCHERS;BEHAVIORS;SCIENCE;MAIL;Patient Dropouts;Information Dissemination,,,"5_adresses_government_health,2 _not_qualitative/_video_data_",,Excluded,Excluded,1

Failure of recent data sharing initiatives indicates an urgent need to invest in societal trust in researchers and institutions. Key to an informed understanding of such a 'social license' is identifying the views patients and the public may hold with regard to data sharing for health research. Methods We performed a narrative review of the empirical evidence addressing patients' and public views and attitudes towards the use of health data for research purposes. The literature databases PubMed (MEDLINE), Embase, Scopus and Google Scholar were searched in April 2019 to identify relevant publications. Patients' and public attitudes were extracted from selected references and thematically categorised. Results Twenty-seven papers were included for review, including both qualitative and quantitative studies and systematic reviews. Results suggest widespread-though conditional-support among patients and the public for data sharing for health research. Despite the fact that participants recognise actual or potential benefits of data research, they expressed concerns about breaches of confidentiality and potential abuses of the data. Studies showed agreement on the following conditions: value, privacy, risk minimisation, data security, transparency, control, information, trust, responsibility and accountability. Conclusions Our results indicate that a social license for data-intensive health research cannot simply be presumed. To strengthen the social license, identified conditions ought to be operationalised in a governance framework that incorporates the diverse patient and public values, needs and interests.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health",10.1136/medethics-2019-105651,SOCIAL LICENSE;PARTICIPANTS;GENOMICS;CONSENT,,,5_adresses_government_health,,Excluded,Excluded,1

In Guatemala, acute food insecurity reaches alarming levels when the usual dry period during the bimodal rainy seasons is extended or starts earlier than expected. Drought has a slow-onset which theoretically leaves sufficient lead-time for addressing impacts on food security. In practice, emergency response to drought is often reactive and arrives late, starting when the crisis is already evolving. Climate services and food security information systems are key ingredients for integrated climate risk and food security management worldwide. In Guatemala, stakeholders broadly agree on the usefulness of this type of information for decision-making and direct significant efforts towards improving information availability and quality. But the impact of agro-climatic and food security information on decisions is ad hoc or not systematic. Through a mix of qualitative, ethnographic, and participatory methods, we investigated why this situation occurs. We found that different aspects lead to this phenomenon: the impact of drought on food security is mediated by different socio-economic, political, and institutional factors that tend to differ strongly between regions or even communities across the country. This puts special requirements on information provision for decision-making. Information use patterns can be explained by technical, data-related aspects as reliability, timeliness, or accessibility. But only by considering the institutional and organizational context we get a complete understanding on what frames the information-use patterns in climate and food security management in Guatemala. Our research shows that investments in technical aspects of data provision and infrastructure for increased climate and food security management need to address institutional and organizational challenges in order to be effective.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using",10.1016/j.crm.2020.100248,DECISION-SUPPORT;DROUGHT;FORECASTS;SYSTEMS;WEATHER;Food,,,1 not sharing/ not using,,Excluded,Excluded,1

Qualitative data regarding the acceptability of these reports at participating cancer centers (CCs) are also provided.        Data were collected from 2226 patients treated at 16 CCs via mailed/Web questionnaires. Twelve items assessing patient perceptions of symptom management-pain, fatigue, emotional distress-served as key quality indicators. Medico-demographic variables suitable for case-mix adjustment were selected using an index score combining predictive power and heterogeneity across CCs. SMQI reports were designed with staff feedback and produced for each CC, providing crude and adjusted CC-specific rates, along with study-wide rates for comparison purposes.        Cancer type and participant educational level were selected for case-mix adjustment based upon high index scores. The Kendall rank correlation coefficient showed that case-mix adjustments changed the ranking of CCs on the key quality indicators (% Delta rank range: 5-22 %). The key quality indicators varied across CCs (all p < 0.02). SMQI reports were well received by CC staff, who described plans to share them with key personnel (e.g., cancer committee, navigator).        This paper provides one method for creating hospital-level SMQI reports, including case-mix adjustment. Variation between CCs on key quality indicators, even after adjustment, suggested room for improvement. SMQI reports based on patient-reported data can inform and motivate efforts to improve care through professional/patient education and applying standards of care.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health",10.1007/s11136-016-1305-7,PROPENSITY SCORE METHODS;CANCER CENTERS PROGRAM;CASE-MIX ADJUSTMENT;IMPROVING QUALITY;PERFORMANCE;CARE;IMPACT,,,5_adresses_government_health,,Excluded,Excluded,1

This can be described as a tools and techniques perspective, which assumes that software project management success is dependent on having the right instruments available, rather than on the individual qualities of the project manager or the cumulative qualities and skills of the software organisation. Surprisingly, little is known about how (or whether) these tools techniques are used in practice. This study, in contrast, uses a qualitative grounded theory approach to develop the basis for an alternative theoretical perspective: that of competence. A competence approach to understanding software project management places the responsibility for success firmly on the shoulders of the people involved, project members, project leaders, managers. The competence approach is developed through an investigation of the experiences of project managers in a medium sized software development company (WM-data) in Denmark. Starting with a simple model relating project conditions, project management competences and desired project outcomes, we collected data through interviews, focus groups and one large plenary meeting with most of the company's project managers. Data analysis employed content analysis for concept (variable) development and causal mapping to trace relationships between variables. In this way we were able to build up a picture of the competences project managers use in their daily work at WM-data, which we argue is also partly generalisable to theory. The discrepancy between the two perspectives is discussed, particularly in regard to the current orientation of the software engineering field. The study provides many methodological and theoretical starting points for researchers wishing to develop a more detailed competence perspective of software project managers' work.

The relevant government agencies for school land reuse in Taiwan, such as the Ministry of Education and municipal governments, mostly provide subjective regulations or revitalization provisions for the sustainable development of school resources; however, no specific scientific assessment or a planning procedure has been proposed to revitalize school land. Therefore, constructing a scientific, quantitative, and objective planning framework and procedure is necessary for the adaptive reuse of school land based on the needs of overall society and urban development in order to replace the existing and outdated planning philosophy and to correct prominent shortcomings of past planning operations that were solely in accordance with the qualitative judgment and decision making of official agencies. In this study, we mainly adopted the analytic network process (ANP) and big data, including demographics, facility usage, and social welfare indicators, to assist the Taipei City government to construct or reform land reuse strategies for junior high and elementary schools facing immediate or future closure, consolidation, or downsizing. To take a more realistic approach to improve final decision making, the investigation of expert questionnaires through the ANP was based on the consideration of future trends that were objectively evaluated by big datasets. The novel planning philosophy and concise decision framework for reuse strategies we designed are expected to improve public decision-making transparency, adaptive reuse effectiveness, and quality of urban life. Ultimately, our proposed strategies and suggestions can not only assist local public sectors to promote the policy of adaptive reuse of surplus school lands but also serve as an appropriate blueprint of urban sustainability for the central government in the near future.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health",10.1007/s11205-018-1951-y,URBAN REGENERATION;SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT;DECISION-MAKING;ANP        PRIORITIES;CITY;HIERARCHY;MODEL;REAL;OPPORTUNITIES;DEPENDENCE,,,5_adresses_government_health,,Excluded,Excluded,1

Property valuation, as one of the main functions of land administration systems, is influenced by locational, physical, legal, and economic factors. Despite the importance of property valuation to economic development, there are often no standardized rules or strict data requirements for property valuation for taxation in developing contexts, such as Rwanda. This study aims at assessing different remote sensing data in support of developing a new approach for property valuation for taxation in Rwanda; one that aligns with the FFPLA philosophy. Three different remote sensing technologies, (i) aerial images acquired with a digital camera, (ii) WorldView2 satellite images, and (iii) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images obtained with a DJI Phantom 2 Vision Plus quadcopter, are compared and analyzed in terms of their fitness to fulfil the requirements for valuation for taxation purposes. Quantitative and qualitative methods are applied for the comparative analysis. Prior to the field visit, the fundamental concepts of property valuation for taxation and remote sensing were reviewed. In the field, reference data using high precision GNSS (Leica) was collected and used for quantitative assessment. Primary data was further collected via semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions. The results show that UAVs have the highest potential for collecting data to support property valuation for taxation. The main reasons are the prime need for accurate-enough and up-to-date information. The comparison of the different remote sensing techniques and the provided new approach can support land valuers and professionals in the field in bottom-up activities following the FFPLA principles and maintaining the temporal quality of data needed for fair taxation.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 _not_human_observation_response_data",10.3390/rs13183563,UAV,,,3 _not_human_observation_response_data,,Excluded,Excluded,1

Despite recent trends claiming that anyone can create and use data, cities remain marked by persistently uneven access and usage of digital technologies. This is the case as well within the emergent phenomenon of the 'smart city,' where open data are a key strategy for achieving 'smartness,' and increasingly constitute a fundamental dimension of urban life, governance, economic activity, and epistemology. The digital ethnography has extended traditional ethnographic research practices into such digital realms, yet its applicability within open data and smart cities is unclear. The method has tended to overlook the important roles of particular digital artifacts such as the database in structuring and producing knowledge. In this paper, we develop the database ethnography as a rich methodological resource for open data research. This approach centers the database as a key site for the production and materialization of social meaning. The database ethnography draws attention to the ways digital choices and practices-around database design, schema, data models, and so on-leave traces through time. From these traces, we may infer lessons about how phenomena come to be encoded as data and acted upon in urban contexts. Open databases are, in other words, key ways in which knowledges about the smart city are framed, delimited, and represented. More specifically, we argue that open databases limit data types, categorize and classify data to align with technical specifications, reflect the database designer's episteme, and (re)produce conceptions of the world. We substantiate these claims through a database ethnography of the open data portal for the city of Calgary, in Western Canada.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 _not_qualitative/_video_data_,3 _not_human_observation_response_data",10.1177/1468794119885040     EA NOV 2019,ONLINE;KNOWLEDGE;POLITICS;SCIENCE,,,"2 _not_qualitative/_video_data_,3 _not_human_observation_response_data",,Excluded,Excluded,1

The complexity of HIV care and associated comorbidities drives the need for medical and psychosocial care coordination, which may be achieved through health information exchange (HIE) systems. However, the use of HIE has not been well studied in the context of HIV services. The purpose of this descriptive qualitative study is to explore factors influencing case managers' adoption of electronic clinical data (ECD) summaries as an HIE strategy in HIV care through application of the """"fit between individuals, task and technology"""" (FITT) framework.        Methods: Focus group methodology was used to gather perceptions from 48 participants who provided direct case management services for PLWH in New York City. Questions addressed current quality and efficiency challenges to HIE utilization in the context of case management of PLWH as well as barriers and enablers to use of an ECD summary. Analysis of the data was guided by the FITT framework.        Results: Major themes by interaction type were: (1) task-technology fit - resources, time and workflow; (2) individual-task fit - training and technical support; and 3) individual-technology fit - ECD summary functionality, technical difficulties and the need of a computer for each end-user.        Conclusions: Our findings provide evidence for the applicability of the FITT framework to explore case managers' perceptions of factors influencing the adoption of ECD summary systems for HIV care prior to actual implementation.

The paper provides insights into how managers within the hotel sector both manage and use the data as a core tool in discussions with finance managers/directors during negotiation on critical marketing investments.        Design/methodology/approach The research design followed a multiple-case study design of five market-orientated hotels, which were selected as high performing data and dashboard users. Across each case company multiple informants were interviewed and shadowed, including marketing managers, general managers and finance managers/directors. There was also an in-depth investigation of the collection, dissemination and particularly use of traditional market research data and online data from social media sites, web sites and web and mobile analytics. This was augmented by a study of the customized, off site managed interactive databases, in use in all case companies.        Findings This paper identifies managerial challenges experienced by general managers, marketing and financial managers using digital customer data. It investigated the power of the customer voice internally and found that unstructured qualitative data had greater visibility and usage once supported by a financial imperative. It also found that the use of interactive dashboards were a powerful manifestation of data technology use and increased marketing's visibility, power and accountability within the firm.        Research limitations/implications The paper provided a limited hotel perspective which impacts on generalizability. The findings should be tested quantitatively to ascertain their validity across a wider sector of businesses and operations. Though multiple site and cross-functional research adds value, one site might have provided more depth.        Practical implications This paper reveals that managers need support in terms of time, resources and personnel to manage the flood of information into their organizations. It also suggested that general and marketing managers need to develop the skills to interpret the data for decision-making, so that the financial implications are understand.        Originality/value Most social media studies within the hotel sector focus on the impact of social media reviews on consumer purchasing processes and/or on how managers communicate online with consumers. This paper takes an internal managerial perspective on data use for decision-making. This paper expands our understanding of marketing strategic decision-making through an in-depth exploration into how cross-functional decision-making uses contemporary customer data.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using,3 _not_human_observation_response_data",10.1108/TR-03-2017-0064,SOCIAL MEDIA;TOURISM;TECHNOLOGIES;PERFORMANCE;INFORMATION;MANAGEMENT;ANALYTICS;BEHAVIOR;MODEL,,,"1 not sharing/ not using,3 _not_human_observation_response_data",,Excluded,Excluded,1

However, incorporating data management practices into an organization is not a simple task. The purpose of this paper is to provide a new understanding of the challenges in establishing and developing the MDM function within an organization.        Design/methodology/approach - This papers report an ethnographic study within a municipality. The data were collected from two consecutive MDM development projects over the time period of 32 months by observing MDM-related activities and interviewing appropriate actors. Observations, interviews, and impressions were documented to a diary that was later qualitatively analyzed. Various project documentation were also used.        Findings - In total 15 challenges were identified. Seven of these were not identified earlier in the literature. New challenges included legislation-driven challenges, mutual understanding of master data domains, and the level of granularity for those domains. Eight issues, such as data owner and data definitions, were MDM specific, others being more generic. All of the issues were identified as preconditions or as affecting factors for the others. Three of the issues were identified as pivotal. The issues emphasize strong alignment between the complex concept of MDM and the organization adopting it.        Research limitations/implications - This research was based on a single qualitative case study, and caution should be exercised with regard to generalizations. The findings increase understanding about the complex organizational phenomena. The study offers public sector and private sector practitioners insights of the organizational issues that establishing a MDM function can encounter.        Originality/value - The issues discovered in the research shed light on the strong alignment between the complex concept of MDM and the organization. The results of this study assist researchers in their endeavor to understand the organizational aspects of MDM, and to build theoretical models, frameworks, practices, and explanations.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using,3 _not_human_observation_response_data",10.1108/JEIM-07-2015-0070,QUALITY;BARRIERS,,,"1 not sharing/ not using,3 _not_human_observation_response_data",,Excluded,Excluded,1

Talk about medicine taking was contextualized to the demands of the interaction. Strategies included avoiding direct reference to findings; collectively aligning with medical perspectives; and using stories to carry opinions. Participants also expressed moral discourses around managing asthma in everyday life. These discursive variations strengthened assertions of the role of morality in participants' talk and highlighted advantages in engaging with participants' strategies in focus groups.

The modification and reinterpretation of economic functions are the primary focus of the innovation in government administration style under the wave of economic globalisation. The effectiveness of the government's economic administration determines the general level of public administration at the federal level. An essential issue of national public administration that has a significant impact on the political growth of many nations is the performance evaluation of government economic administration. The people are the subject of government economic administration performance evaluation, and the people adjudicate the outcomes. An essential method of assessing the productivity of various departments is through performance review. The nation is currently in the process of switching from its long-standing planned economic system to a market economic system. The internal and external environments of governmental organisations are continually changing in addition to the strong trend of economic globalisation. Determining and advancing the national government's economic administration model is so crucial. The article offers a multidimensional data mining-based optimum design scheme for the thorough assessment of government economic administration performance. The fuzzy comprehensive evaluation rule is an effective method for quantifying the qualitative indicators when the quantitative indicators in the evaluation index system are difficult to measure. It is relatively simple, reasonable, and simple to operate in practise, which is conducive to the thorough and scientific performance evaluation of the government economic administration's science and technology administration functions. Following an assessment of the system's performance using association rule data mining technologies, a simulation test analysis is completed. The accuracy of the proposed arithmetic, which is 8.26% higher than the conventional arithmetic, is demonstrated by simulation results. The development of an evaluation model that incorporates both subjective and objective criteria, as well as the thorough assessment of the effectiveness of government economic administration based on data mining technologies, has excellent application prospects and practical value.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",10.1155/2022/4265125,FOREST;ENERGY;HEALTH,,,"1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",,Excluded,Excluded,1

In Belgium, five paediatric liaison teams (PLTs) deliver palliative care. A Royal Decree issued in 2010 provides the legal framework that defines the PLTs' missions, as ensuring continuity of curative and palliative care between the hospital and home for children diagnosed with life-limiting conditions. This national study describes how PLTs ensure continuity of care by describing their activities and the characteristics of the children they cared for from 2010 to 2014.        Methods: Thematic analysis of open-ended questions was performed and descriptive statistics of aggregated data issued from annual reports, collected by the Belgian Ministry of Public Health through the Cancer Plan was used. A review panel of PLT members discussed the results and contributed to their interpretation.        Results: Between 2010 and 2014, 3607 children and young adults (0-21 years) were cared for by the 5 Belgian PLTs (mean of 721/per year). Of these children, 50% were diagnosed with an oncological disease, 27% with a neurological or metabolic disease. Four hundred and twenty eight (428) children had died. For 51% of them, death took place at home. PLT activities include coordination; communication; curative and palliative care; education; research and fundraising. Different perceptions of what constitutes a palliative stage, heterogeneity in reporting diagnosis and the current lack of specific valid indicators to report PPC activities were found.        Conclusion: PLTs are offering highly individualised, flexible and integrated care from diagnosis to bereavement in all care settings. Improvements in data registration and implementation of outcome measures are foreseen.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",10.1186/s12904-018-0324-2,LIFE-LIMITING CONDITIONS;QUALITATIVE-ANALYSIS;CHILDREN;HOSPICE;COMMUNITY;FAMILIES;CANCER;RECOMMENDATIONS;CONTINUITY;SERVICES;Palliative Care;Belgium;Statistics as Topic,,,"1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",,Excluded,Excluded,1

For PRO data to be useful at either level, we need to understand their clinical relevance. Purpose: To provide clarity on whether and how methods historically developed to interpret group-based PRO research results might be applied in clinical settings to enable PRO data from individual patients to inform their clinical management and decision-making. Methods: We first differentiate PRO-based decision-making required at group versus individual levels. We then summarize established group-based approaches to interpretation (anchor-based and distribution based), and more recent methods that draw on item calibrations and qualitative research methods. We then assess the applicability of these methods to individual patient data and individual-level decision-making. Findings: Group-based methods provide a range of thresholds that are useful in clinical care: some provide screening thresholds for patients who need additional clinical assessment and/or intervention, some provide thresholds for classifying an individual's level of severity of symptoms or problems with function, and others provide thresholds for meaningful change when monitoring symptoms and functioning over time during or after interventions. Availability of established cut-points for screening and symptom severity, and normative/reference values, may play into choice of PRO measures for use in clinical care. Translatability of thresholds for meaningful change is more problematic because of the greater reliability needed at the individual-level versus group-level, but group-based methods may provide lower bound estimates. Caution is needed to set thresholds above bounds of measurement error to avoid """"false-positive changes"""" triggering unwarranted alerts and action in clinic. Conclusions: While there are some challenges in applying available methods for interpreting group-based PRO results to individual patient data and clinical care-including myriad contextual factors that may influence an individual patient's management and decision-making-they provide a useful starting point, and should be used pragmatically.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",10.1097/MLR.0000000000001111,QUALITY-OF-LIFE;MINIMALLY IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES;HEALTH-STATUS;STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE;INTRAINDIVIDUAL CHANGES;CLINICAL-PRACTICE;SCORES;IMPROVE;CARE;RESPONSIVENESS,,,"1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",,Excluded,Excluded,1

Methods This paper presents the results of a citizen forum that included 73 participants. A research tool titled """"the mechanics of consent"""" was designed for this study. This tool is a table encouraging participants to reflect on social and research actors, types of data, and desired levels of control while sharing different types of data with different actors. Participants' discussion that led to the completion of each table were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis. Results The results are a compilation of responses from the mechanics of consent tool divided into two sections; the first presents quantitative results of collective responses regarding attitudes to consent to donate their data. The second section present qualitative findings emerged from the discussion amongst participants. Discussion Choice and control of personal data is crucial for the public to be able to decide who and how to trust. Key information to be disclosed to potential research participants shall include information about potential risks and benefits; who will be accessing and using their data; as well as assurances that their choice will be respected. Furthermore, researchers ought to make sure they are trustworthy, by acting in a competent, reliable, and honest manner. Governance systems ought to be better equipped to address ethical issues raise by the growing presence of non-traditional research actors, consent of exchanges of data via digital devices and online activity such as social media and fairness of data trading.

This article reports on qualitative one-to-one interviews with adults in families (n = 32), one mother/father dyad interview (n = 2) and focus groups with practitioners (n = 47) in five local authority areas in North East England receiving or providing Early Help support. We explored experiences of providing consent to share personal information and consider the usefulness of a digital health data system when providing Early Help support to families. Communication Privacy Management theory was used as a framework to analyse the data. Key themes in participants' accounts include the degree of need for help and support; the importance of trusting relationships; stronger and structured joint working practices; and understanding how information is shared. This work provides insights into current information sharing practices for some of the most vulnerable families and the wider social contexts. It has implications for the usefulness of a digital data system that shares GP health data with Early Help services and suggests the role this could have in the parent-practitioner relationship.        Early Help support can be provided to children and their families as soon as a problem emerges, to help them overcome the challenges they face. This support is voluntary and for practitioners to share information about a family's circumstances with another organisation, parents are required to give their permission for this to happen. There are several factors that can influence if and how information sharing happens. These factors should be considered when designing new ways of sharing information such as digital data sharing systems.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health",10.1093/bjsw/bcab167     EA AUG 2021,CRITICAL REALISM;HEALTH;SERVICES;NEEDS,,,5_adresses_government_health,,Excluded,Excluded,1

Data quality assessments (DQA) afford the opportunity to collect information about health service data. Through its Rapid Access Expansion Programme (RAcE), the World Health Organization (WHO) funded non-governmental organizations (NGO) to support Ministries of Health (MOH) in implementing integrated community case management (iCCM) programs in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Malawi, Mozambique, Niger and Nigeria. WHO contracted ICF to support grantee monitoring and evaluation efforts, part of which was to conduct DQAs to enhance program monitoring and decision making. The contribution of DQAs to data-driven decision making has been documented and the purpose of this paper is to describe how DQAs contributed to health management information system (HMIS) strengthening and the findings of subsequent DQAs in those areas.        Methods ICF created a mixed-methods DQA for iCCM data, comprising a review of the data collection and management system, a data tracing component and key informant interviews. The DQA was applied twice in each RAcE site, which enables a general comparison of system-level attributes before and after the first DQA application. For this qualitative assessment, we reviewed DQA reports to collate information about DQA recommendations and how they were addressed before a subsequent DQA, along with the findings of the second DQA.        Results Findings from the first DQA in each RAcE site stimulated NGO and MOH efforts to strengthen different aspects of the HMIS in each country, including modifying data collection tools in the Democratic Republic of Congo; training community health workers (CHWs) and supervisors in Malawi; strengthening supervision in Mozambique; improving CHW registers and strengthening staff capacity at all levels to report data in Niger; establishing a data review system in Abia State, Nigeria; and, establishing processes to improve data use and quality in Niger State, Nigeria.        Conclusion Data quality assessments stimulated context-specific efforts by NGOs and MOHs to improve iCCM data quality. DQAs can serve as a collaborative and evidence-based activity to influence discussions of data quality and stimulate HMIS strengthening efforts.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",10.7189/jogh.09.010806,Research Design;Information Systems,,,"1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",,Excluded,Excluded,1

Birth cohorts (BC) involve longitudinal designs, significant sample sizes and rich and deep datasets. Data sharing benefits include more analyses, greater research complexity, increased opportunities for collaboration, amplification of public contributions, and reduced respondent burdens. Sharing BC data involves significant challenges including consent, privacy, access policies, communication, and vulnerability of the child. Research on these issues is available for biological data, but these findings may not extend to BC data. We lack consensus on how best to approach these challenges in consent, privacy, communication and autonomy when sharing BC data. We require more stakeholder engagement to understand perspectives and generate consensus.MethodsParents participating in longitudinal birth cohorts completed a web-based survey investigating consent preferences for sharing their, and their child's, non-biological research data. Results from a previous qualitative inquiry informed survey development, and cognitive interviewing methods (n=9) were used to improve the question quality and comprehension. Recruitment was via personalized email, with email and phone reminders during the 14-day window for survey completion.ResultsThree hundred and forty-six of 569 parents completed the survey in September 2014 (60.8%). Participants preferred consent processes for data sharing in future independent research that were less-active (i.e. no consent or opt-out). Parents' consent preferences are associated with their communication preferences. Twenty percent (20.2%) of parents generally agreed that their child should provide consent to continue participating in research at age 12, while 25.6% felt decision-making on sharing non-biological research data should begin at age 18.ConclusionsThese finding reflect the parenting population's preference for less project-specific permission when research data is non-biological and de-identified and when governance practices are highly detailed and rigourous. Parents recognize that children should become involved in consent for secondary data use, but there is variability regarding when and how involvement occurs. These findings emphasize governance processes and participant notification rather than project-specific consent for secondary use of de-identified, non-biological data. Ultimately, parents prefer general consent processes for sharing de-identified, non-biological research data with ultimate involvement of the child.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health,2 _not_qualitative/_video_data_",10.1186/s12911-018-0683-x,WOMENS ATTITUDES;EMPIRICAL-DATA;BIOBANKS;CHILDREN;PRIVACY;PARTICIPATION;RETURN;Cross-Sectional Studies;Cesarean Section,,,"5_adresses_government_health,2 _not_qualitative/_video_data_",,Excluded,Excluded,1

This study evaluated the suitability of semi-outdoor space in four aspects including environmental measurements, physiological measurements, subjective measurements and cognitive performance tests. However, the manual processing and analysis of such multidimensional data can be time-consuming and error-prone. Hence, the objective of this study was to develop a semi-automatic method to manage and analyze the data from different instruments and platforms and two open-source applications (a stroop color and word test and a digit span test) for cognitive performance tests. These codes were critical to the success of the project, providing an effective framework for data extraction, data pre-processing, data analysis and performance tests. Eighty-nine people participated in the experiment of evaluation of thermal comfort, cognitive performance, physiological performance and environmental parameters in semi-outdoor spaces in a tropical setting. Each participant received cognitive tests to assess their selective attention, short-term memory, concentration and creativity quotient. Concurrently, qualitative measurements were conducted to assess thermal sensation, thermal comfort and thermal acceptability. The heart rate, skin temperature, and skin conductance of participants were measured throughout the experiments. Microclimatic variables such as illuminance, noise levels, dry-bulb air temperature, global temperature, relative humidity, air speed, and air direction were monitored simultaneously. To understand the effects of semi-outdoor spaces on participant performance, this study recorded participant performance in different environments through controlled experiments. Data related to participants in different settings include those shared (e.g., environmental measurement), and data unique to each participant (e.g., physiological performance). The results revealed that the subjects' cognitive and physiological performance did not change significantly after switching to the semi-outdoor space due to the availability of natural and mechanical ventilation, suggesting that short-term office activities in the semi-outdoor space are feasible in the tropics.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health,3 _not_human_observation_response_data",10.3390/su15010183,TEMPERATURE;Cognition,,,"5_adresses_government_health,3 _not_human_observation_response_data",,Excluded,Excluded,1

Twelve mid-level managers from large-scale Indian organizations that have extensively adopted data science tools and techniques participated in a semi-structured and in-depth interview process. Findings Our findings unfolded several perspectives gained from their experiences, leading thereby to two emergent person-job (mis)fit process models. (1) Managers, who perceived demands-abilities misfit (D-A misfit) as a growth-alignment opportunity vis a vis their corresponding actions, which effectively trapped them into a vicious cycle; and (2) the managers, who considered D-A misfit as a psychological strain vis a vis their corresponding actions, which engaged them into a benevolent cycle. Research limitations/implications The present paper has major theoretical and managerial implications in the field of human resource management and business analytics. Practical implications The findings advise managers that the focus should be on developing an organizational learning eco-system, which would enable mid-level managers to gain their confidence and control over their job and work environment in the context of data science disruptions. Importantly, organizations should facilitate integrated workplace learning (both formal and informal) with an appropriate ecosystem to help mid-level managers to adapt to the data-science disruptions. Originality/value The present study offers two emergent cyclic models to the existing person-job fit literature in the context of data science disruptions. A scant attention of the earlier researchers on how individual employees actually experience disruption, and the corresponding IPA method used in the present study may add significant value to the extant literature. Further, it opens a timely and relevant future research avenues in the context of data science disruptions.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",10.1108/MD-01-2020-0099     EA NOV 2020,PERSON-ENVIRONMENT FIT;BIG DATA ANALYTICS;STRESS;KNOWLEDGE;CONSEQUENCES;ANTECEDENTS;ORIENTATION;VERSIONS;TIME;Independent Practice Associations,,,"1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",,Excluded,Excluded,1

Some solutions may be offered by ecosystem-based fisheries and conservation management. However, understanding their effectiveness relies on the availability of good quality data on the size distributions and abundance of fish populations and assemblages, collected at appropriate temporal and spatial scales. Since the early 2000s, baited remote underwater video systems (BRUVs) have become a popular tool for collecting data on fish assemblages across a range of depths and habitats. In Australia, this technique has been adopted by many different agencies and institutions, creating a unique opportunity to compile a continental-scale synthesis of fish data using a standardised sampling technique. Key Australian researchers and managers were invited to contribute to a synthesis workshop on baited underwater video in Albany, Western Australia between the 4th and 8th of February 2018. Data from 19,939 BRUVs deployments, collected between 2000 and 2017 around Australia, were compiled using GlobalArchive (globalarchive.org). The workshop identified and prioritised several key research themes that would contribute to the conservation and sustainable management of focal species and broad assemblages. Our goal is to describe where and when the data were collected, the type of equipment used and how the imagery was analysed. We also discuss the types of questions that can be addressed by analysing these standardised datasets and the potential benefits to conservation and fisheries management.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using",10.1016/j.marpol.2021.104430     EA FEB 2021,STEREO-VIDEO;REEF FISHES;TEMPERATE;ASSEMBLAGES;BEHAVIOR;Australia,,,1 not sharing/ not using,,Excluded,Excluded,1

Good quality data is essential for health policy and planning decisions yet, little is known on whether and how broad health systems strengthening programmes affect quality of data. This paper explores the effects of the SURE-P/MCH on completeness of MCH data in the National HMIS. Methods: This mixed-methods study was undertaken in Anambra state, southeast Nigeria. A standardized proforma was used to collect facility-level data from the facility registers on MCH services to assess the completeness of data from 2 interventions and one control clusters. The facility data was collected to cover before, during, and after the SURE-P intervention activities. Qualitative in-depth interviews were conducted with purposefully-identified health facility workers to identify their views and experiences of changes in data quality throughout the above 3 periods.Results: Quantitative analysis of the facility data showed that data completeness improved substantially, starting before SURE-P and continuing during SURE-P but across all clusters (ie, including the control). Also health workers felt data completeness were improved during the SURE-P, but declined with the cessation of the programme. We also found that challenges to data completeness are dependent on many variables including a high burden on providers for data collection, many variables to be filled in the data collection tools, and lack of health worker incentives. Conclusion: Quantitative analysis showed improved data completeness and health workers believed the SURE-P/MCH had contributed to the improvement. The functioning of national HMIS are inevitably linked with other health systems components. While health systems strengthening programmes have a great potential for improved overall systems performance, a more granular understanding of their implications on the specific components such as the resultant quality of HMIS data, is needed.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",10.34172/ijhpm.2020.226     EA DEC 2020,DATA QUALITY;Child Health Services;Information Systems;Nigeria,,,"1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",,Excluded,Excluded,1

This study compared dental students' self-report of course video viewing with LMS data.        Methods Dental students in a 2018 flipped pediatric dentistry course were given a questionnaire after course completion that captured self-reported course video viewing. Student data and time spent on videos were extracted from the LMS and matched to the questionnaire. McNemar's test evaluated differences between self-reported and matching LMS data.        Results Of the 109 enrolled students, 99 (91%) completed the questionnaire. Most students self-reported that they watched more than half of the videos (71%), re-watched at least once (89%), and watched at times other than 8 a.m.-5 p.m. (80%). Of the 104 students with data from the LMS, 40% of students watched more than half of the videos, 49% re-watched at least one video, and 60% watched between 8 a.m.-5 p.m. LMS data showed 14 (13%) students did not watch any videos. Significant differences were found between self-reported video viewing and matched LMS video data in (1) percentage of videos watched, (2) number of times videos were re-watched, and (3) most frequent time for watching the videos (p < 0.001 for all).

This increase in the secondary uses of health data has led to increased interest in what the public thinks about data sharing, in particular, the possibilities of sharing with the private sector for research and development. Although international evidence demonstrates broad public support for the secondary use of health data, this support does not extend to sharing health data with the private sector. If governments intend to share health data with the private sector, knowing what the public thinks will be important. This paper reports a national survey to explore public attitudes in Australia toward sharing health data with private companies for research on and development of therapeutic drugs and medical devices.        Objective: This study aims to explore public attitudes in Australia toward sharing government health data with the private sector.        Methods: A web-based survey tool was developed to assess attitudes about sharing government health data with the private sector. A market research company was employed to administer the web-based survey in June 2019.        Results: The survey was completed by 2537 individuals residing in Australia. Between 51.8% and 57.98% of all participants were willing to share their data, with slightly fewer in favor of sharing to improve health services (51.99%) and a slightly higher proportion in favor of sharing for research and development (57.98%). There was a preference for opt-in consent (53.44%) and broad support for placing conditions on sharing health information with private companies (62% to 91.99%). Wide variability was also observed in participants' views about the extent to which the private sector could be trusted and how well they would behave if entrusted with people's health information. In their qualitative responses, the participants noted concerns about private sector corporate interests, corruption, and profit making and expressed doubt about the Australian government's capacity to manage data sharing safely. The percentages presented are adjusted against the Australian population.        Conclusions: This nationally representative survey provides preliminary evidence that Australians are uncertain about sharing their health data with the private sector. Although just over half of all the respondents supported sharing health data with the private sector, there was also strong support for strict conditions on sharing data and for opt-in consent and significant concerns about how well the private sector would manage government health data. Addressing public concern about sharing government health data with the private sector will require more and better engagement to build community understanding about how agencies can collect, share, protect, and use their personal data.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health",10.2196/24200,PERSPECTIVES;PUBLICATION;INFORMATION;CONSENT;VIEWS;BIAS,,,5_adresses_government_health,,Excluded,Excluded,1

Public involvement is essential to building locally responsive research policies, including on data sharing, but little research has involved stakeholders from low-to-middle income countries.        Methods Between January and June 2014, a qualitative study was conducted in Kenya involving sixty stakeholders with varying experiences of research in a deliberative process to explore views on benefits and challenges in research data sharing. In-depth interviews and extended small group discussions based on information sharing and facilitated debate were used to collect data. Data were analysed using Framework Analysis, and charting flow and dynamics in debates.        Findings The findings highlight both the opportunities and challenges of communicating about this complex and relatively novel topic for many stakeholders. For more and less research-experienced stakeholders, ethical research data sharing is likely to rest on the development and implementation of appropriate trust-building processes, linked to local perceptions of benefits and challenges. The central nature of trust is underpinned by uncertainties around who might request what data, for what purpose and when. Key benefits perceived in this consultation were concerned with the promotion of public health through science, with legitimate beneficiaries defined differently by different groups. Important challenges were risks to the interests of study participants, communities and originating researchers through stigmatisation, loss of privacy, impacting autonomy and unfair competition, including through forms of intentional and unintentional 'misuse' of data. Risks were also seen for science.        Discussion Given background structural inequities in much international research, building trust in this low-to-middle income setting includes ensuring that the interests of study participants, primary communities and originating researchers will be promoted as far as possible, as well as protected. Important ways of building trust in data sharing include involving the public in policy development and implementation, promoting scientific collaborations around data sharing and building close partnerships between researchers and government health authorities to provide checks and balances on data sharing, and promote near and long-term translational benefits.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: research | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health | USER-NOTES: {""""Jürgen""""=>[""""health""""]}",10.1371/journal.pone.0135545,EXPERIENCES;PERSPECTIVE;ISSUES;Kenya;Information Dissemination,,,5_adresses_government_health |,research,Excluded,Excluded,1

Considering the stigma and confidentiality issues historically associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease, we examine how trust-in technology, processes, and people-influenced the acceptability of data sharing among stakeholders prior to implementation of six HIEs intended to improve HIV care in parts of the United States. Our analyses identify the kinds of concerns expressed by stakeholders about electronic data sharing and focus on the factors that ultimately facilitated acceptability of the new exchanges.        Methods: We conducted 549 surveys with patients and 66 semi-structured interviews with providers and other stakeholders prior to implementation of the HIEs to assess concerns about confidentiality in the electronic sharing of patient data. The patient quantitative data were analyzed using SAS 9.2 to yield sample descriptive statistics. The analysis of the qualitative interviews with providers and other stakeholders followed an open-coding process, and convergent and divergent perspectives emerging from those data were examined within and across the HIEs.        Results: We found widespread acceptability for electronic sharing of HIV-related patient data through HIEs. This acceptability appeared to be driven by growing comfort with information technologies, confidence in the security protocols utilized to protect data, trust in the providers and institutions who use the technologies, belief in the benefits to the patients, and awareness that electronic exchange represents an enhancement of data sharing already taking place by other means. HIE acceptability depended both on preexisting trust among patients, providers, and institutions and on building consensus and trust in the HIEs as part of preparation for implementation. The process of HIE development also resulted in forging shared vision among institutions.        Conclusions: Patients and providers are willing to accept the electronic sharing of HIV patient data to improve care for a disease historically seen as highly stigmatized. Acceptability depends on the effort expended to understand and address potential concerns related to data sharing and confidentiality, and on the trust established among stakeholders in terms of the nature of the systems and how they will be used.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health",10.1186/1748-5908-7-34,ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD;PATIENTS ATTITUDES;PRIVACY;CARE;TECHNOLOGY;MANAGEMENT;EXPERIENCES;PHYSICIANS;IMPROVE;QUALITY,,,5_adresses_government_health,,Excluded,Excluded,1

A multidimensional evaluative approach is needed.        Objective: This paper discusses one important dimension of Web evaluation-usage data. In particular, we discuss the collection and analysis of external data on website usage in order to develop a better understanding of the health information (and related US government information) market space, and to estimate the market share or relative levels of usage for National Library of Medicine (NLM) and National Institutes of Health (NIH) websites compared to other health information providers.        Methods: The primary method presented is Internet audience measurement based on Web usage by external panels of users and assembled by private vendors-in this case, comScore. A secondary method discussed is Web usage based on Web log software data. The principle metrics for both methods are unique visitors and total pages downloaded per month.        Results: NLM websites (primarily MedlinePlus and PubMed) account for 55% to 80% of total NIH website usage depending on the metric used. In turn, NIH.gov top-level domain usage (inclusive of NLM) ranks second only behind WebMD in the US domestic home health information market and ranks first on a global basis. NIH.gov consistently ranks among the top three or four US government top-level domains based on global Web usage. On a site-specific basis, the top health information websites in terms of global usage appear to be WebMD, MSN Health, PubMed, Yahoo! Health, AOL Health, and MedlinePlus. Based on MedlinePlus Web log data and external Internet audience measurement data, the three most heavily used cancer-centric websites appear to be www.cancer.gov (National Cancer Institute), www.cancer.org (American Cancer Society), and www.breastcancer.org (non-profit organization).        Conclusions: Internet audience measurement has proven useful to NLM, with significant advantages compared to sole reliance on usage data from Web log software. Internet audience data has helped NLM better understand the relative usage of NLM and NIH websites in the intersection of the health information and US government information market sectors, which is the primary market intersector for NLM and NIH. However important, Web usage is only one dimension of a complete Web evaluation framework, and other primary research methods, such as online user surveys, usability tests, and focus groups, are also important for comprehensive evaluation that includes qualitative elements, such as user satisfaction and user friendliness, as well as quantitative indicators of website usage.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",10.2196/jmir.7.3.e31,Information Services;Internet,,,"1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",,Excluded,Excluded,1

Laboratory and simulation studies have demonstrated that, when engaging in a secondary task, drivers adopt strategies to interrupt, delay and resume the secondary task in order to manage their workload and risk. However, there is very little knowledge of the time-sharing strategies that drivers adopt for interweaving their attention across multiple tasks in real-world driving. This study examined the nature of observable visual and/or manual secondary task interruptions in real-word driving using naturalistic driving data. Video of 186 randomly selected trips from the Australian Naturalistic Driving Study were viewed to identify a range of secondary tasks and whether, when and why drivers interrupted engagement in these secondary tasks. It was found that under everyday naturalistic driving conditions, drivers interrupt (or temporarily disengage from) only a small percentage (13.5%) of the secondary tasks engaged in, with 87 percent of these tasks interrupted to re-engage in the driving task. The number of interruptions made to secondary tasks was found to differ according to a number of task characteristics, including task duration and visual load, with tasks of longer duration and higher visual load more likely to be interrupted. The results have a range of practical implications, particularly for the design of invehicle devices that better support drivers to break down long tasks into a series of sub-tasks, so that they can more easily disengage when driving demands necessitate.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using,3 _not_human_observation_response_data",10.1016/j.ssci.2020.104841,DISTRACTION;DECISION;BEHAVIOR,,,"1 not sharing/ not using,3 _not_human_observation_response_data",,Excluded,Excluded,1

Willingness to participate (WTP) in biomedical research is a function of trust in the scientific team, which is closely tied to the source of funding and institutional connections.        OBJECTIVE To determine whether WTP and willingness to share social media data are associated with the type of research team and online recruitment platform.        DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This mixed-methods longitudinal survey and qualitative study was conducted over 2 points (T1 and T2) using Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) platform. Participants were US adults aged 18 years or older who use at least 1 social media platform. Recruitment was stratified to match race/ethnicity proportions of the 2010 US Census. The volunteer sample consisted of 914 participants at T1, and 655 participants completed the follow-up survey 5 months later (T2).        MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Outcomes were (1) past experience with online research and sharing social media data for research; (2) WTP in research advertised online; (3) WTP in a study sponsored by a pharmaceutical company, a university, or a federal agency; and (4) willingness to share social media data. Opinions were solicited regarding the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation statute, which came into effect between T1 and T2.        RESULTS Of 914 participants completing the first survey (T1), 604 (66.1%) were aged 18 to 39 years and 494 (54.0%) were female. Of these, 655 participants (71.7%) responded at T2. While 680 participants (74.4%) indicated WTP in biomedical research, only 454 (49.3%) were willing to share their social media data. Participants were significantly less likely to participate in federally sponsored (odds ratio [OR], 0.58; 95% CI, 0.51-0.64; P <.001) or pharmaceutical company (OR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.53-0.66; P <.001) research than university-led studies. They were also less likely to share their social medial data for federal (OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.58-0.72; P <.001) or pharmaceutical company (OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.44-0.56; P <.001) research compared with academic studies. Willingness to participate in pharmaceutical company-led research decreased 11.89% from T1 to T2 (OR for T2, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.54-0.77; P <.001). Reasons for WTP were interest in furthering science, financial incentives, trust in the organization, and data security. While 63.0% of respondents reported seeing new privacy policy emails related to the General Data Protection Regulation law, only 27.1% indicated this positively influenced their WTP. Thematic analysis of responses indicated that WTP may improve with stronger data security measures.        CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study suggests that researchers may see reduced online research participation and data sharing, particularly for research conducted outside academia.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health,3 _not_human_observation_response_data",10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2019.15717,SAMPLE,,,"5_adresses_government_health,3 _not_human_observation_response_data",,Excluded,Excluded,1

Digital technologies enable patients to perform tasks traditionally carried out by health care professionals in a more convenient way, at lower costs, and without compromising quality. Patients may also share real-world data with other stakeholders to promote individual and population health. However, there is a need for legal frameworks that enable patient privacy and control in such sharing of real-world data. We believe that this need could be met by the conceptualization of patient-controlled real-world data as knowledge commons, which is a resource shared by a group of people.        Objective: This study aimed to propose a conceptual model that describes how patient-controlled real-world data can be shared effectively in chronic care management, in a way that supports individual and population health, while respecting personal data privacy and control.        Methods: An action research approach was used to develop a solution to enable patients, in a self-determined way, to share patient-controlled data to other settings. We chose the context of cystic fibrosis (CF) care in Sweden, where coproduction between patients, their families, and health care professionals is critical in the introduction of new drugs. The first author, who is a lawyer and parent of children with CF, was a driver in the change process. All coauthors collaborated in the analysis. We collected primary and secondary data reflecting changes during the time period from 2012 to 2020, and performed a qualitative content analysis guided by the knowledge commons framework.        Results: Through a series of changes, a national system for enabling patients to share patient-controlled real-world data to different stakeholders in CF care was implemented. The case analysis resulted in a conceptual model consisting of the following three knowledge commons arenas that contributed to patient-controlled real-world data collection, use, and sharing: (1) patient world arena involving the private sphere of patients and families; (2) clinical microsystem arena involving the professional sphere at frontline health care clinics; and (3) round table arena involving multiple stakeholders from different settings. Based on the specification of property rights, as presented in our model, the patient can keep control over personal health information and may grant use rights to other stakeholders.        Conclusions: Health information exchanges for sharing patient-controlled real-world data are pivotal to enable patients, health care professionals, health care funders, researchers, authorities, and the industry to coproduce high-quality care and to introduce and follow-up novel health technologies. Our model proposes how technical and legal structures that protect the integrity and self-determination of patients can be implemented, which may be applicable in other chronic care settings as well.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health",10.2196/16842,CENTERED CARE;HEALTH-CARE;CYSTIC-FIBROSIS;COPRODUCTION;Health Services Research,,,5_adresses_government_health,,Excluded,Excluded,1

Most studies investigating pedestrian-vehicle interactions at non-signalized intersections have focused on interactions at the crosswalk on the same approach where the vehicle is coming from, which are referred to as primary interactions in this study. However, secondary interactions, defined as interactions between vehicles exiting the intersection and crossing pedestrians, have not been adequately studied. Second interactions can pose more dangers to pedestrians due to the driver's unclear knowledge of right-of-way, acceleration attempts to recover the speed, and the complex situation the driver faces in the intersection. This paper aims at studying the safety issue of secondary pedestrian-vehicle interactions at non-signalized intersections. For that purpose, a methodology is proposed based on surrogate measures of safety and behavioral measures derived from vision-based trajectories. This methodology is implemented through a case study involving ten all-way stop intersections from Montreal, Canada. Road user trajectory data are automatically extracted from the videos. Different measures are used in the study: from the interaction analysis that determines vehicle-pedestrian interactions based on a Distance-Velocity (DV) model, average crossing speeds and vehicle approaching behaviors in terms of speed and acceleration. Computer tools are developed to extract these measures from the trajectory data. Based on these measures, a comparative analysis is carried out between primary and secondary interactions. Results show that secondary interactions are more dangerous than primary interactions. Among the three secondary interaction types, secondary through interactions are the most dangerous.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using",10.1016/j.trc.2019.06.001,SURROGATE SAFETY;ROAD SAFETY;CROSSWALKS;PREDICTION;BEHAVIOR;EVALUATE;BICYCLE;SPEED,,,1 not sharing/ not using,,Excluded,Excluded,1

We interpret findings from our interviews using theory that highlights the importance of dynamic interactions between people and their environments, which include the prevailing rules (e.g., regulatory guidance). Our findings contribute to the accounting literature and practice by revealing three areas of conflict emerging from stakeholders' disparate preferences for data analytics. First, we uncover growing tensions between managers and audit partners regarding audit fees. Second, we find that managers and auditors believe the lack of accounting regulation specific to data analytics causes confusion and frustration. Finally, auditors report that they strategically leverage data analytics to provide clients with business-related insights. However, regulators voice concerns that this practice might impair auditor independence and reduce audit quality. These areas of conflict suggest a need to revisit key tensions surrounding the audit function in a contemporary context characterized with significant technological shift.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",10.1111/1911-3846.12680     EA JUN 2021,"BIG DATA;QUALITATIVE RESEARCH;FIRMS;TRANSITION;SYSTEMS;ISSUES;OPPORTUNITIES;ACCOUNTANTS;INNOVATION;DYNAMICS;Social Control, Informal;Social Control, Formal",,,"1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",,Excluded,Excluded,1

While such a behavior might generally be considered as rather safe, it could be argued that the associated diversion of attention away from the road still leads to a reduction of situational awareness, which might increase collision risk once the car regains motion. This is especially relevant for texting, which is associated with considerable eyes-off-the-road-time. Nonetheless, it seems that previous research has barely addressed the actual engagement in secondary tasks while waiting at a red light (as compared to just addressing the tasks' mere prevalence). Objective: The present study investigated secondary task engagement while stopped at a red light using European naturalistic driving data collected through the UDRIVE project. Attention was given to the whole engagement process, including simple prevalence and the tasks' relation (in terms of start/end) to the red light period. Moreover, given that texting is one of the most problematic forms of distraction, it was characterized in more detail regarding glance behavior. Method: Videos of 804 red light episodes from 159 drivers were annotated. Glance behavior was also coded for a sub-set of 75 texting events and their matched baselines. Results, conclusions and practical applications: Drivers engaged in at least one secondary task across almost half of the annotated red light episodes. Drivers who texted while stopped spent most of the time looking at their cell phone. Consequently, drivers might not have been prepared for potentially unexpected events once the light turned green. Further, drivers concluded texting a considerable number of times well after the red light period, which has potential implications for traffic safety.

Video recordings of in-vehicle and external scenes were coded for precisely defined categories of secondary tasks and related contextual variables. The findings indicated that nearly one-quarter of the total driving time at intersections was spent on secondary activities and that lower engagement occurred within intersections compared to phases immediately upstream or downstream. Drivers were less likely to occupy themselves with secondary tasks when their vehicles were moving than when they were stationary. Elderly drivers showed less inclination to perform secondary tasks than did younger drivers. Lastly, drivers tended to perform secondary tasks less frequently at intersections managed by traffic signs than those controlled by traffic lights, when they did not have priority compared to when they had priority, and in adverse weather conditions compared to fine weather conditions. In conclusion, drivers appeared to self-regulate secondary task engagement in response to roadway and environmental conditions. Specifically, they exercised self-regulation by reducing their secondary task engagement when the driving task was more challenging. The findings from this study provide preliminary evidence for targeting the education and training of drivers and media campaigns related to safe driving strategies and managing distractions.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using,3 _not_human_observation_response_data",10.1016/j.aap.2020.105464,DISTRACTION;INATTENTION;BEHAVIOR;CRASHES,,,"1 not sharing/ not using,3 _not_human_observation_response_data",,Excluded,Excluded,1

We begin by comparing features of topic modeling to related techniques (content analysis, grounded theorizing, and natural language processing). We then walk through the steps of rendering with topic modeling and apply rendering to management articles that draw on topic modeling. Doing so enables us to identify and discuss how topic modeling has advanced management theory in five areas: detecting novelty and emergence, developing inductive classification systems, understanding online audiences and products, analyzing frames and social movements, and understanding cultural dynamics.

The RELY (Reliable disabilityEvaLuation in psychiatrY)-studies introduced semi-structured functional interviews in real-life assessments of claimants with mental disorders for evaluating their self-perceived health-related limitations and for investigating the reproducibility of work capacity (WC) estimates. Functional interviews elicit claimants' self-perceptions about their work-related limitations and capacities in the labour market. This secondary data analysis explored the coverage of work-related key topics in these interviews and investigated whether interviews with high coverage (versus low coverage) of work-related topics resulted in better reproducibility of WC estimates among experts. Methods Thirty video-taped RELY-assessments underwent a content analysis along a predefined framework for functional interviewing, including the claimant's self-perceived work limitations and work-related health complaints as centrepieces of functional interviewing. Following transcription, interviews were segmented into coding units. Coding units were allocated to the five steps with 19 key topics of the framework. Enquiry into key topics was ascertained by summing the functional coding units per key topic. Median split grouped the interviews into high and low coverage of functional topics and compared them for inter-rater reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC) and inter-rater agreement (standard error of measurement, SEM). Results Interviews were broken down in 40,010 coding units, 31% of which addressed functional topics. Enquiries in self-perceived work limitations and work-related health complaints were sparse (coding units median(psychiatrist)between 0 and 1.5, median(patients)between 0 and 9.5). High coverage interviews enquired on more functional topics (68% vs. 42%, chi(2)(1, N = 38) = 5.32, p = 0.021) and in more depth (36% vs. 16% of functional coding units, chi(2)(1, N = 1,314) = 141.15, p < 0.001). Interviews with higher functional coverage reached significantly higher inter-rater agreement in WC ratings among experts (mean difference in SEM, low-high coverage, 7.5% WC, 95% CI 0.2 to 15.1%WC). Inter-rater reliability was low in both groups (ICC, 0.38 versus 0.40). Conclusions Content analysis showed little enquiry by experts on claimants' self-perceived activity limitations and work-related capacity. The association between interviews with higher functional coverage and better expert agreement on the claimants' remaining WC requires confirmation in prospective studies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00621,INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION;SOCIAL-SECURITY;HEALTH FUNCTION;RELIABILITY;ASSESSMENTS;Disability Evaluation,,,"1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",,Excluded,Excluded,1

Sensors can reduce respondent burden by eliminating survey questions and improve measurement accuracy by replacing/augmenting self-reports. However, if respondents who are not willing to collect sensor data differ on critical attributes from those who are, the results can be biased. Research on the mechanisms of willingness to collect sensor data mostly comes from (nonprobability) online panels and is hypothetical (i.e., asks participants about the likelihood of participation in a sensor-based study). In a cross-sectional general population randomized experiment, we investigate how features of the request and respondent characteristics influence willingness to share (WTS) and actually sharing smartphone-sensor data. We manipulate the request to either mention or not mention (1) how participation will benefit the participant, (2) participants' autonomy over data collection, and (3) that data will be kept confidential. We assess nonparticipation bias using the administrative records. WTS and actually sharing varies by sensor task, participants' autonomy over data sharing, their smartphone skills, level of privacy concerns, and attitudes toward surveys.

Some nonresponse and nonparticipation biases are substantial and make each other worse, but others jointly reduce the overall bias.

These agencies use data on asset conditions to make decisions regarding the timing of maintenance activities, the type of treatment, and the resources to employ. To collect and record these data, agencies often utilize trained evaluators who assess the asset either on site or by analyzing photos and/or videos. These visual assessments are widely used to evaluate conditions of various assets, including pavement surface distresses. This paper describes a Data Quality Assessment & Improvement Framework (DQAIF) to measure and improve the performance of multiple evaluators of pavement distresses by controlling for subjective judgment by the individual evaluators. The DQAIF is based on a continuous quality improvement cyclic process that is based on the following main components: (1)assessment of the consistency over timeperformed using linear regression analysis; (2)assessment of the agreement between evaluatorsperformed using inter-rater agreement analysis; and (3)implementation of management practices to improve the results shown by the assessments. A large and comprehensive case study was employed to describe, refine, and validate the framework. When the DQAIF is applied to pavement distress data collected on site by different evaluators, the results show that it is an effective method for quickly identifying and solving data collection issues. The benefit of this framework is that the analyses employed produce performance measures during the data collection process, thus minimizing the risk of subjectivity and suggesting timely corrective actions. The DQAIF can be used as part of an asset management program, or in any engineering program in which the data collected are subjected to the judgment of the individuals performing the evaluation. The process could also be adapted for assessing performance of automated distress data acquisition systems.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using,3 _not_human_observation_response_data",10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000427,MANUAL PAVEMENT DISTRESS,,,"1 not sharing/ not using,3 _not_human_observation_response_data",,Excluded,Excluded,1

Findings KSB on new media platform could be enhanced by richer knowledge content of the video posted and the attribute of the platform users directly. Platform users could affect the trustworthiness of the knowledge shared, thus influence the knowledge sharing. On the early stage of the COVID-19, the richer content of the knowledge released by users could effectively enhance the KSB. On the early stage of the emergency events, the official users could play a significant role on KS. During the mitigation stage of COVID-19, the KSB of the knowledge shared by unofficial users with richer content could be enhanced and the moderation effect is relatively stronger. Originality/value The research extends the social exchange theory to a disaster management context. The authors provide an effective reference for future governments to effectively cope with the epidemic and spread public knowledge in an emergency response context.

Las agencias gubernamentales de transporte administran este capital y utilizan la informacion de las condiciones de este para decidir la programacion y tipo de mantenimiento y recursos a ejercer. Para recolectar la informacion pertinente, las agencias emplean evaluadores adiestrados para evaluar la infraestructura, ya sea en sitio o analizando fotografias y/o videos. Las evaluaciones visuales son empleadas para inspeccionar las condiciones de la infraestructura, incluyendo el desgaste de la superficie de los caminos y carreteras. Este articulo describe un Data Quality Assessment & Improvement Framework (DQAIF) (Sistema de Evaluacion y Mejora de la Calidad de la Informacion) para medir y controlar los datos de los evaluadores del deterioro de carreteras, al controlar el criterio de estos. El DQAIF es en un proceso ciclico de Mejora Continua de Calidad compuesto por: a)la evaluacion del nivel de acuerdo entre evaluadores -por medio del analisis estadistico (inter-rater agreement analysis), b)la evaluacion de la consistencia a traves del tiempo -mediante analisis de regresion lineal, y c)la implementacion de practicas gerenciales para mejorar los resultados mostrados en las evaluaciones anteriores.

Moreover, in the anesthetic process, the conditions change rapidly and the task is frequently interrupted. Several studies (Gaba, 1994; Xiao, Milgram, & Doyle, 1997a, b) have demonstrated the importance of preoperative preparation tasks. In the present study, we focused on preliminary planning activities by studying the strategies for information gathering and the notation of the selected data. ne anesthetists' major aim during this preoperative phase is to assess the risks of the anesthesia for the patient and to anticipate for potential problems. During the consultation, the anesthetists exhaustively scan the patient's medical framework via the medical interview and the clinical examination, and the data collected are written down on a one-page paper sheet, which is Part of the anesthetic record. According to French new legal recommendations, this anesthetic record should be typewritten. To deal with this requirement, several types of software have been developed to handle medical information gathering and recording during the preoperative phase. We used such a prototype, named Anesthesia Mobile System (AMS). We then compared the anesthetists' strategies for collecting relevant medical information in the two situations : one-page paper sheet and AMS. All the consultations were videotaped and we performed autofacing interviews. We recorded the duration of the consultations, the fields and domains investigated and completed, the data collected and recorded, the type of notation used. We then described the patient/anesthetist dialogs via diagrams connecting the anesthetists' questions, the patients' answers and the resulting recorded data.        The results suggest that the anesthetists can use three strategies to gather information (i) they can question the patient following the standard order set by the paper file; (ii) from an information given by the patient, they can identify some significant pattern and rely on this inference to seek further specific information, and (iii) sometimes, they allow the patient to """"tell his/her story"""". ne anesthetists can alternate those strategies during the consultation, each one weighing more or less depending on the complexity of the medical case. The mixed utilization of these three strategies plays one main function : It allows the anesthetists to elaborate a proper representation of the medical case, via an of """"opportunistic"""" information gathering. Among the information provided by the patients, the anesthetists select relevant data allowing them to characterize and categorize the medical case and to ground the decision for the anesthesia itself. The recorded data can be either raw information or interpreted items which contain elements for planning the anesthetic process and information allowing the assessment of the plan and its adjustment during the surgery, according to the patient's physiological status. The comparison of data gathering and recording with the paper file and with the computer shows important differences : With the computerized record, the consultation lasts six times longer, more data are recorded but some of these data are less relevant and, conversely, some essential data are not present. Due to some characteristics of the AMS, interface, the alternation of strategies for information gathering becomes impossible, and the users are constrained to adopt the systematic order set by the interface, which is close to the structure of the paper sheet. This constraint stiffens the dialog patient/anesthetist, that becomes very,formal, and interferes with the elaboration of the representation of the medical case. This negative interference is reinforced by the fact that the anesthetists cannot have before their eyes all the information already recorded while they go on with the medical interview. The results are discussed and particularly for their implications on the specification of software to handle medical information gathering","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",10.3917/th.651.0059,BEHAVIOR;ERRORS;Referral and Consultation,,,"1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",,Excluded,Excluded,1

According to the third-party doctrine, the government can access all such information without a warrant or without infringing on Fourth Amendment privacy protections. This exposure of vast amounts of highly personal data to government intrusion is permissible because the Supreme Court has interpreted the third-party doctrine as a per se rule. However, that interpretation rests on an improper understanding of the reasonable expectation of privacy standard developed in Katz v. United States.        There is a solution. A close reading of Katz's logic can reorient third-party analysis from a per se rule to a tailored test of the knowledge of the sharer and the nature of the recipient, asking whether the sharer (1) knowingly exposed information (2) to the public.

There are several issues regarding informed consent in emergency neurologic trials, including a shared decision-making process with the patient or a legally authorized representative about overall risks, benefits, and alternative treatments.        Methods: To evaluate the informed consent process, we collected best and worst informed consent practice information from a National Institutes of Health trial and used this in medical simulation videos to educate investigators at multiple sites to improve the consent process. Clot Lysis: Evaluating Accelerated Resolution of Intraventricular Hemorrhage Phase III (CLEAR III) (clinicaltrials.gov, NCT00784134) studied the effect of intraventricular alteplase (n = 251) versus saline (placebo) injections (n = 249) for intraventricular hemorrhage reduction. Reasons for ineligibility (including refusing to consent) for all screen failures were analyzed. The broadcasted presentation outlined best practices for doctor-patient interactions during the consenting process, as well as anecdotal, study-specific reasons for consent refusal. Best and worst consent elements were then incorporated into a simulation video to enhance the informed consent process. This video was disseminated to trial sites as a webinar around the midpoint of the trial to improve the consent process. Pre- and post-intervention consent refusals were compared.        Results: During the trial, 10,538 patients were screened for eligibility, of which only three were excluded due to trial timing. Pre-intervention, 77 of 5686 (1.40%) screen eligible patients or their proxies refused consent. Post-intervention, 55 of 4849 (1.10%) refused consent, which was not significantly different from pre-intervention (P = 0.312).

A hedonic survey was administered to 74 alcohol dependent patients treated for an average of 3.5 years with nearly continuous month-long intramuscular XR-NTX. The paper-and-pencil, one-time survey asked patients about the degree of pleasure they experienced in the past 90 days with drinking alcohol, sex, exercise and other daily activities. The data revealed lower pleasure ratings for alcohol than for sex, exercise and 10 other common activities. Mean responses to drinking alcohol and gambling were significantly lower than to listening to music, sex, reading, being with friends, eating good food, eating spicy food, and playing video/card games. This effect was independent of XR-NTX dose or duration. Although this exploratory study lacked baseline data, a comparison group or control for the impact of patient discontinuation, the data indicate the feasibility of examining long-term hedonic response in recovery. The differential hedonic ratings suggest that, in patients who persist with long-term continuous therapy, XR-NTX may selectively inhibit the pleasure associated with drinking alcohol, compared to a variety of other activities.

In the Consortium for Research in Electroconvulsive Therapy (CORE) trial, depressed patients recently remitted with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) were randomly assigned to receive continuation therapy with either ECT or medications. The purpose of this article is to describe the design characteristics and challenges of the trial and of our method of dealing with the lack of double-blind outcome assessment.        Methods: The primary outcome measure was time to relapse of depression in the continuation phase. We developed a method to achieve partial blinding of depressive severity assessment. This consisted of videotaping the structured interviews, having the videotapes co-rated by personnel not involved in the patient's care, and a videotape-tracking maneuver so that the assessor of the videotapes could be blinded to phase and type of treatment.        Results: We enrolled 624 patients into the initial treatment phase of the trial. Of these, 201 met criteria for randomization into the second, continuation phase. Our videotape-tracking maneuver to reduce bias in outcome assessment worked well during the trial.        Conclusions: The CORE study is the first multicenter, randomized controlled trial of continuation ECT in the relapse prevention of major depressive episodes. We successfully recruited a large number of severely depressed patients into a 6 month trial and used a method of reducing bias that might result from lack of blinding.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",10.1097/yct.0b013e31814515d6,MAJOR DEPRESSION;REMISSION;ECT;PHARMACOTHERAPY;Recurrence;Electroconvulsive Therapy,,,"1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",,Excluded,Excluded,1

The goal of this study was to assess the willingness of people living with chronic pain to share personal identifiers on the web for the linkage of medico-administrative and patient-reported data.        Methods This methodological investigation was achieved in the context of the implementation of the chronic pain treatment (COPE) cohort. A web-based recruitment initiative targeting adults living with chronic pain was conducted in the province of Quebec (Canada).        Results A total of 1935 participants completed the questionnaire (mean age: 49.86 +/- 13.27; females: 83.69%), 921 (47.60%) of which agreed to data linkage and shared their personal identifiers (name, date of birth, health insurance number online). The most common reasons for refusal were: (1) concerns regarding data security/privacy (25.71%) and (2) the belief that the requested data were too personal/intrusive (13.52%). Some participants did not understand the relevance of data linkage (11.81%). Participants from the COPE cohort and those from the subsample who agreed to data linkage were comparable to other random samples of chronic pain individuals in terms of age and pain characteristics.        Conclusions Although approximately half of the participants refused data linkage, our approach allowed for the implementation of a data platform that contains a diverse and substantial sample. This investigation has also led to the formulation of recommendations for web-based data linkage, including placing items designed to assess willingness to share personal identifiers at the end of the questionnaire, adding explanatory videos, and using a mixed-mode questionnaire.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",10.1002/pds.5255     EA MAY 2021,CLINICAL-TRIALS;PREVALENCE;IMPACT;DATABASES;SERVICES;LINKING;RECORDS;TRENDS,,,"1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",,Excluded,Excluded,1

To assess the risk of PM exposure to a car driver more realistically, we measure the exposure to PM in a car cabin with a mobile aerosol spectrometer in Frankfurt am Main under different settings (local variations, opened versus a closed window) and compare it with data from stationary measurement. A video camera monitored the surroundings for potential PM source detection. In-cabin concentrations peaked at 508 mu g m(-3) for PM10, 133.9 mu g m(-3) for PM2.5, and 401.3 mu g m(-3) for coarse particles, and strongly depended on PM size and PM concentration in ambient air. The concentration of smaller particles showed low fluctuations, but the concentration of coarse particles showed high fluctuations with maximum values on busy roads. Several of these concentration peaks were assigned to the corresponding sources with characteristic particle size distribution profiles. The closure of the car window reduced the exposure to PM, and in particular to coarse particles. The mobile measured PM values differed significantly from stationary PM measures, although good correlations were computed for finer particles.

To identify available sources of publicly available data specific to Hawai'i, REL Pacific researchers solicited recommendations from 2013 Annual Hawaii Partnership for Educational Research Consortium (HPERC) Symposium attendees. REL Pacific researchers examined the list provided by the symposium attendees to identify data sources that were publicly available, Hawai'i-specific, and address at least one of HPERC's nine research priority areas (see Appendix A for the methods used to vet the data sources for inclusion in this document). The nine HPERC priority areas are: (1) Teacher training; (2) Technology-supported curriculum/use of technology in the classroom; (3) English language learner services and support; (4) Teacher evaluation; (5) Graduation rate; (6) Model schools/best practices; (7) NCLB requirement waivers/redefining school success; (8) Instructional time; and (9) Special education services. The data sources included in this document are divided into state and national data sources. Of the 11 state data sources, the Hawaii State Department of Education maintains four, Kamehameha Schools houses three, and the University of Hawai'i (UH) manages four. For the national data sources, the Department of Education maintains two data sources, Department of Health and Human Services houses two data sources, the Department of Labor maintains one data source, the National Science Foundation maintains one data source, and the U.S. Census Bureau houses one data source, totaling seven national data sources. In total, in-depth information on 18 publicly available, Hawai'i-specific data sources that can be used by education researchers to address at least one of HPERC's nine research priority areas is provided in this document. The following are appended: (1) Methodology; (2) Data Source Table; (3) Accountability Data Center; (4) College and Career Readiness Indicators Reports; (5) Hawaii Public Schools Reports for IDEA Part B; (6) Strive HI Performance System; (7) After Graduation Plan for KS Class of 2006; (8) Native Hawaiian Educational Attainment Charts; (9) No Child Left Behind, 2004; (10) Center on the Family Data Center; (11) Hawai'i School Health Survey: Youth Risk Behavior Survey; (12) Institutional Research and Analysis Office; (13) KIDS COUNT Data Center; (14) State Education Data Profiles (Common Core of Data); (15) 2009-10 \& 2011-12 District or School Reports (Civil Rights Data Collection); (16) Detailed Data Tables (Civil Rights Data Collection); (17) State and National Estimations (Civil Rights Data Collection); (18) National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs; (19) National Survey of Children's Health; (20) Special Tabulations of U.S. Census Data--Limited English Proficiency; (21) Science and Engineering Indicators 2014 State Data Tool; and (22) U.S. Census Bureau's 2008-2012 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health","",Academic Degrees;Access to Information;Accountability;Career Readiness;Census Figures;Child Health;College Readiness;Community Surveys;Data;Early Childhood Education;Educational Attainment;Educational Indicators;Educational Legislation;Elementary Secondary Education;Engineering Education;Enrollment;Federal Legislation;Federal Programs;Hawaiians;High School Graduates;Information Sources;Institutional Characteristics;Limited English Speaking;National Competency Tests;National Surveys;Public Agencies;Public Schools;School Districts;School Effectiveness;Schools;Science Education;Social Indicators;Special Education;State Departments of Education;State Surveys;Universities,,,5_adresses_government_health,,Excluded,Excluded,1
rayyan-1093358080,Student {{Data Privacy Communications Toolkit}},2016,,"","","",,,"","","","","","","Parents expect school districts and schools to keep their children safe while they are in school. That expectation of safety and security also extends to the protection of their children's learning data. Therefore, it is critical that school districts and schools are open and transparent about their student data privacy practices, and that those efforts are clearly communicated to parents and other stakeholder groups. By sharing information on the types of student data collected, the purpose and benefits of collecting this information and the ways in which it is protected, school districts and schools can help dispel misperceptions about student data use and assuage concerns. This student data privacy toolkit provides school districts and schools with recommendations on how to most effectively communicate with parents and other stakeholder groups about student data privacy, as well as a host of communications tools that can be used in these communications efforts. All toolkit resources are generalized for blanket use, so areas in which customized district-specific information are required are in brackets and highlighted in yellow. Districts also need to be sure that their policies, practices and procedures match the recommendations implied throughout the toolkit. Those instances will be noted as well. Be sure to have appropriate school or school district personnel review and approve any communications or materials prior to releasing. This could include, but is not be limited to, the school or school district general counsel and privacy officer. Additionally, while the focus of this toolkit is communicating data privacy practices and plans, demonstrating the value to data to parents is also important. When equipped with the right skills and tools, everyone who plays a role in education can have a strong impact on students and their communities. Parents can be their child's champion along the path to success. Teachers can be sure that their students are really learning what they are teaching. Principals and district administrators can use data to manage schools, allocate resources, and communicate with their communities. Policymakers can create the conditions for success in states and throughout the country. Education data are a powerful tool, but only if they are securely in the hands of the people who need the data, when they need the data. For more resources from Data Quality Campaign (DQC) and others to communicate the power of data to improve a child's education visit the Additional Resources section of this toolkit.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using","",Access to Information;Child Safety;Childrens Rights;Crisis Management;Data Collection;Educational Legislation;Electronic Mail;Guidelines;Information Dissemination;Information Security;Information Utilization;Letters (Correspondence);Newspapers;Organizational Communication;Parent Materials;Parent Rights;Parent School Relationship;Planning;Privacy;School Policy;Social Media;Student Records;Student Rights,,,1 not sharing/ not using,,Excluded,Excluded,1

School leaders in this context included leaders at the district, school, and classroom levels. An extensive literature review provided the framework for this study including Brunner, Fasca, Heinze, Honey, Light, Mardinach, and Wexler (2005), Knapp, Swinnerton, Copland, and Monpas-Huber (2006), Mandinach, Honey, Light, Heinze, and Nudell (2005), Mandinach, Honey, and Light (2006), Marsh, Pane, and Hamilton (2006), National Education Technology Trends Survey (2005, 2007), among others. Though data-informed decision-making is not a new concept in industry or education, the data-reporting demands of the No Child Left Behind Act has fueled districts' investments in technology and data analysis tools. The case study employed a mixed data collection approach. Qualitative data were collected through interviews of 12 leaders (1 superintendent, 1 technology leader, 2 principals, 2 curriculum coordinators, 2 instructional specialists, and 4 lead teachers), and review of district documents. Quantitative data were collected through an online survey of the teachers in the district to validate or triangulate portions of the interview data. Qualitative data were analyzed at various levels of descriptive analyses, in which codes were generated, organized, and grouped into analytical categories. Findings showed that leaders used various forms of data to make various types of decisions. The district provided the tools and training. In addition, leaders' organizational roles or levels impacted the forms of data they used and the types of decisions made. Organizational roles also impacted leaders' perceptions of which environmental factors (political, economic, cultural, and technological) influenced their use of student data to make decisions. A culture of data use was more prevalent among accountability workgroups such as English, math, and science teachers--evidence that political forces influence teachers' data use. Cultural and human resource capacities were developed through professional learning communities and early release days. Teachers had time but wanted more time. District Y is modeled after best practices. Recommendations were made for all stakeholders as well as the government and schools of education.

Analysis of data revealed three themes that exposed differences in the use of data by teachers and administrators: the challenges of data use, the """"levels"""" at which data are viewed (micro and macro lenses), and the value placed on formal and informal data. Findings suggest that by understanding the differences between teachers' and administrators' perspectives on data use and recognizing the common ground that unites their perspectives, schools can create data cultures that foster shared expectations, collaboration, and trust between teachers and administrators.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using","",Administrator Attitudes;Barriers;Data Use;Decision Making;Elementary School Teachers;Expectation;Leadership Training;Principals;Public Schools;School Culture;Secondary School Teachers;Teacher Administrator Relationship;Teacher Attitudes;Time Management;Trust (Psychology),,,1 not sharing/ not using,,Excluded,Excluded,1
rayyan-1093358085,Risk-{{Based Models}} for {{Managing Data Privacy}} in {{Healthcare}},2011,,"","","",,,"","AL Faresi, Ahmed","","","","","Current research in health care lacks a systematic investigation to identify and classify various sources of threats to information privacy when sharing health data. Identifying and classifying such threats would enable the development of effective information security risk monitoring and management policies. In this research I put the first step towards identifying and classifying privacy threats from a selection of health data exchange scenarios. Specifically I investigate data sharing scenarios that occur within a health care organization, between a health organization and a research group, and between patients and online social networks. I first derive the privacy requirements from legislative laws for protecting patient privacy in the U.S., namely the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Using the derived requirements I develop methods to enforce them in the data sharing scenarios specified. I use risk modeling to quantify the privacy threat in each sharing scenario and I incorporate that risk intelligence to develop security solutions to counteract the vulnerabilities found.    I found that sharing health data within a care entity is vulnerable to breaches by authorized users. I developed a risk-scoring model, that profiles authorized healthcare employees based on their tendency to commit privacy breaches. I also found that current access control models that handle health data lack the necessary conditions to enforce HIPAA rules and to involve patients in the management of data. In response I designed an access control framework that enforces HIPAA rules and preserves data privacy when it is shared among authorized users. The access control model makes use of automated object policies that allows patients to set their privacy preferences regarding how data is disclosed and shared.    I identified a privacy vulnerability when genomic data is shared for secondary usage using a real case study. The vulnerability allows the re-identification of contributors to genomic studies by combining information from publicly available data with the geographical location of the study participants. Knowledge of location can be explicitly stated in published results or implicitly inferred from the collection point (i.e. requesting data from a known location). In response I proposed a security protocol to anonymously share medical sequencing data and demonstrated that the risk of re-identification can be reduced with the proposed technique while keeping the fidelity of the data intact.    Finally I identified a privacy vulnerability when patients share data on health social networks, by exploiting the fact that they reuse their pseudonyms in other social networks that contain identifying information about them. A Bayesian model was used to estimate risk, and the method of re-identification was demonstrated empirically. I propose a set of heuristics to reduce the risk of this privacy vulnerability.

Dramatic advances in information and communication technology have opened up unprecedented opportunities for broad public access, innovative research, and citizen engagement, but this potential can be realized only if data are properly managed and exposed over time. New U.S. government requirements for exposing and managing federally funded research data add urgency to the call for curating data so that they can be used, re-used, and exploited by future generations. These new requirements have significant implications for cultural heritage institutions in addressing the current deficit in the capacity to support the re-use of data over time and across generations of technology (digital curation) and in enabling collaboration based on shared infrastructure. Cultural heritage encompasses various types of artifacts (analog or digital), as well as attributes and behaviors that groups or societies maintain over time to preserve connections to the past, present, and future. Cultural heritage institutions have a mission to support, perpetuate, and provide access to essential elements of culture as a whole. There are many different types of cultural heritage institutions, but three of the most commonly recognized are libraries, archives, and museums. Materials in their care are vital to the ongoing advancement and perpetuation of the sciences, social sciences, arts, and humanities. This report presents the implications for the cultural heritage community of the recent focus on creating public access to data and publications resulting from federal funding, and our recommendations for relevant stakeholders. The recommendations are based on a review of federal agencies' responses to new government requirements, case studies of seven digital curation projects, and an investigation of the current professional capacity for the long-term management of cultural heritage digital content, including data.

The key factors examined in this study are risk management, governance, access control, privacy protection, integrity, availability, reliability, and usability. The researcher endeavored to determine how the effectiveness of the factors of effectiveness is impacted when the IA frameworks are applied to a big-data environment within the context of the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) Model. The multiple-case study approached the issue from the perspective of three operational groups, senior decision makers, information assurance professionals, and information security practitioners across three organizations. Data was gathered by face-to-face interview, direct observation, and historic documentation review. Gathered data was processed and evaluated by use of the NVivo 10 software process. The data gathered and analyzed during the multiple-case study leads one to infer that traditional IA control frameworks are engineered to take advantage of the foundational controls of a traditional network-centric data base environment. In a traditional data base environment, the data base management software provides controls such as read/write, content type, and audit logging which are the foundation for the keys of effectiveness. In a big data environment, those foundational controls must be provided by intention through policy, structure, or performance agreement, as opposed to by implementation. Thus, while the key factors of traditional controls are perceived as structurally sound and effective, to remain effective in a big data environment traditional controls and their associated key factors require some level of re-engineering. Or, as in the case of training, greater application is required to gain the perception of trust in a big data environment.

One important prerequisite for scientific thinking is procedural understanding. Procedural understanding is the knowledge about specific steps in scientific inquiry (e.g. formulating hypotheses, measuring dependent and varying independent variables, repeating measurements), and why they are essential (regarding objectivity, reliability, and validity). We present two studies exploring students' ideas about procedural understanding in scientific inquiry using Concept Cartoons. Concept Cartoons are cartoon-like drawings of different characters who have different views about a concept. They are to activate students' ideas about the specific concept and/or make them discuss them. Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to survey students' ideas of procedural understanding and identify core ideas of procedural understanding that are central for understanding scientific inquiry. Design and methods: In the first study, we asked 47 students about reasons for different steps in inquiry work via an open-ended questionnaire using eight Concept Cartoons as triggers (e.g. about the question why one would need hypotheses). The qualitative analysis of answers revealed 42 ideas of procedural understanding (3-8 per Cartoon). We used these ideas to formulate a closed-ended questionnaire that contained the same Concept Cartoons, followed by statements with Likert-scales to measure agreement. In a second study, 64 students answered the second questionnaire as well as a multiple-choice test on procedural understanding. Results: Using methods from educational data mining, we identified five central statements, all emphasizing the concept of confounding variables: (1) One needs alternative hypotheses, because there may be other variables worth considering as cause. (2) The planning helps to take into account confounding variables or external circumstances. (3) Confounding variables should be controlled since they influence the experiment/the dependent variable. (4) Confounding variables should be controlled since the omission may lead to inconclusive results. (5) Confounding variables should be controlled to ensure accurate measurement. Conclusions We discuss these ideas in terms of functioning as core ideas of procedural understanding. We hypothesize that these core-ideas could facilitate the teaching and learning of procedural understanding about experiments, which should be investigated in further studies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using","",Active Learning;Cartoons;Concept Formation;Data Analysis;Educational Research;Hypothesis Testing;Inquiry;Knowledge Level;Science Education;Science Experiments;Science Instruction;Science Process Skills;Scientific Concepts;Teaching Methods,,,1 not sharing/ not using,,Excluded,Excluded,1

In September of 1971, the San Francisco Unified School District desegregated its elementary schools. That it was able to open these schools in semi-normal fashion was due in large part to the services provided by the District's Data Processing Department. This report is intended to serve as a guidebook for Data Processing personnel in other school districts who may be faced with a similar situation. One fundamental change which is made necessary by school desegregation is the evaluation and development of new student assignments to schools based on the racial/ethnic distribution of students. The desegregation plan which had been developed  during the spring of 1971 and accepted by the Court in July organized the City into seven geographic areas or """"zones."""" School assignments are made by Census block. The close to 100 elementary schools which had been previously organized as kindergarten through grade six now were converted to """"primary"""" (i.e., kindergarten to grade three) or """"intermediate"""" (grades four to six.). This required the re-evaluation of school sites and their suitability for primary and intermediate grade levels. The advantage to changing grade level designation is that most children can be assigned to their local school for at least part of their elementary school years.

Unique to the field, a critical component of this study is an emphasis on educators' development of """"data literacy"""" as a knowledge base necessary to the successful education of students in today's classrooms. Study 1 documents the development and validation of a new survey instrument, the """"Perceptions, Knowledge, and Interpretation of Reading Assessment"""" (PKIRA) survey, to assess the perceptions and knowledge of current educators of reading/language arts in grades PK-12. The final version of the PKIRA consists of five sections and/or subscales; (1) demographics, participants' general experience and perceived instructional preparedness section; (2) teacher perception of reading assessment and instruction subscale; (3) teacher reading assessment knowledge and data literacy subscale; (4) teacher knowledge of language structure subscale; and (5) the teacher ability to use data to drive instruction open ended response section. The reliability and validity of this new instrument were analyzed using exploratory factor analysis, item response theory and inter-item correlations. Results indicate the PKIRA is a reliable and valid instrument to measure the knowledge and perceptions of inservice reading teachers. The purpose of Study 2 was to collect data on the knowledge and perceptions from a unique group of inservice reading educators to further validate the PKIRA and determine which aspects of teacher training or experience were associated with reading content knowledge, reading assessment knowledge and data literacy knowledge. Cronbach's alpha, confirmatory factor analysis, item response theory, and ANOVA were used to analyze the data collected. Results provide further support for instrument validation. Results also indicate participants' certification and master's degree status have no statistically significant differences on their mean knowledge score. However, differences in mean knowledge score were found to be associated with teachers' total years teaching and more strongly with, their total years teaching reading. The value of these studies lies in the creation and validation of a reliable new survey instrument that can be used to support the growth and development of data literacy in current educators nationwide. As the PKIRA can provide extensive data on teacher knowledge and perceptions of reading and reading assessment, those who prepare or supervise educators could use the tool to better differentiate and align their instruction to the ever changing needs of the classroom teachers of today.

While the need for information that informs evaluation is important (particularly with the No Child Left Behind Act), Education's data gathering has heretofore presented some problems. It has been burdensome to states because there are multiple and redundant requests administered by a number of offices. In addition, the resulting data supplied by states has not been accurate, timely, or conducive to assessing program performance. To improve the information by which it evaluates such programs and also to ease states' reporting burden, Education in 2002 initiated an ambitious, multi-year plan to consolidate elementary and secondary data collections into a single, department-wide system focused on performance. Given its importance, a study, under the authority of the Comptroller General, to provide Congress with information on its progress was prepared. Through its Performance-Based Data Management Initiative (PBDMI), Education has consolidated and defined much of the data it anticipates collecting under a unified system. Education reports that many data definitions have been agreed-to and data redundancies eliminated. PBDMI officials also said that to date, however, it has not been able to resolve all remaining differences among the program offices that manage many of the different data collections. PBDMI officials have conducted extensive outreach to the states to advance the initiative. The outreach to states involved regional conferences, two rounds of site visits, and according to officials, \$100,000 in grants to most states to help offset their costs. State data providers responding to our survey expressed general satisfaction with the department's outreach, but some were not optimistic that the initiative would ease their reporting burden or enhance their own analytic capacity. The states were not able to produce enough data during test submissions in 2003 and 2004 to enable data quality verification or phasing out the department's multiple data collections. With regard to the lack of sufficient data from many states, Education officials said some lack the technical capacity needed to produce new performance data requirements. State data providers reported having competing demands for their time and resources, given other federal initiatives. Education officials have decided to proceed with the undertaking and have developed a draft interim strategy for moving forward. But they currently have no formal plan for how they would overcome obstacles such as the lack of state data and other technical and training delays to the initiative. Appended are: (1) Scope and Methodology; (2) Comments from the Department of Education; and (3) GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using","",Data Analysis;Data Collection;Elementary Secondary Education;Federal Legislation;Federal Programs;Outreach Programs;Program Effectiveness;Program Evaluation;State Departments of Education,,,1 not sharing/ not using,,Excluded,Excluded,1

Data collected assist the researcher to answer the research questions and address the research problem. The collection, treatment, analysis and interpretation of both secondary and primary data combine to make the researcher produce a report.

In this study, we explored data-driven decision-making processes of K-12 teachers (N = 302) at times of emergency remote teaching, as experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in Israel. Using both quantitative and qualitative methodologies, and a within-subject design, we studied how teachers' data use had changed during COVID-19~days, and which data they would like to receive for improving their decision-making. We based our analysis of the data on the Universal Design of Learning (UDL) model that characterizes the diverse ways of adapting teaching and learning to different learners as a means of understanding teachers' use of data. Overall, we found a decline in data use, regardless of age or teaching experience. Interestingly, we found an increase in data use for optimizing students' access to technology and for enabling them to manage their own learning, two aspects that are strongly connected to remote learning in times of emergency. Notably, teachers wished to receive a host of data about their students' academic progress, social-emotional state, and familial situations.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using","",Change;COVID-19;Data Use;Decision Making;Elementary School Teachers;Emergency Programs;Foreign Countries;Pandemics;Secondary School Teachers;Student Needs;Teacher Attitudes;Emergencies,,,1 not sharing/ not using,,Excluded,Excluded,1

Most current remedial mathematics curricula provide students with a plethora of problems like those traditionally found on the state test. This approach is not working. Finding better ways to teach our urban students may help close this achievement gap. This study examined whether a problem/project-based data analysis unit incorporating the document features of the TI-Nspire would help students master data analysis concepts. The study used a quasi-experimental pre/Post-test design enhanced by a qualitative component. A four-week problem/project based data analysis unit served as the curriculum for the intervention treatment. Students were assigned either the TI-84 or the TI-Nspire calculator. Twelve sections of ninth grade students were divided into four basic study groups: (Intervention (TI-84), Traditional (TI-84), Intervention (TI-Nspire), and Traditional (TI-Nspire)).    The quantitative component of the study analyzed differences between students' pre/post-Total, Multiple-choice, Open-ended mean scores and quantified attitudinal responses. The analysis showed students in the TI-Nspire groups improved more on the Total test and Multiple-choice questions while students in the TI-84 group performed better on Open-ended questions. The Intervention Curriculum was more effective for Multiple-choice questions, Traditional Curriculum for Open-ended questions and Total scores. Student interviews revealed they didn't like taking notes and answering questions on the TI-Nspire. Some students liked referring to the information in the calculator while others felt that accessing information was too time consuming. The merits of the TI-Nspire document feature needs further exploration. Analysis of the quantified attitudinal survey showed an increase in the positive attitudes of students using the TI-Nspire.    Both qualitative and quantitative evidence showed the Traditional TI-84 group had fewer changes in attitude and content knowledge than everyone else combined, suggesting the need to change how we teach data analysis. Problem/project-based learning, if introduced gradually, may prove to be an effective teaching/learning educational practice.    Further exploration needs to match students' technological and data analysis proficiencies when determining readiness for student-centered learning that expects students to be calculator proficient and comfortable with basic quantitative procedures such as finding measures of central tendency and variation.

In this methodological essay, we first distinguish big data from big qual. We define big qual as data sets containing either primary or secondary qualitative data from at least 100 participants analyzed by teams of researchers, often funded by a government agency or private foundation, conducted either as a stand-alone project or in conjunction with a large quantitative study. We then present a broad debate about the extent to which big qual may be transforming some forms of qualitative inquiry. We present three questions, which examine the extent to which large qualitative data sets offer both constraints and opportunities for innovation related to funded research, sampling strategies, team-based analysis, and computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software (CAQDAS). The debate is framed by four related trends to which we attribute the rise of big qual: the rise of big quantitative data, the growing legitimacy of qualitative and mixed methods work in the research community, technological advances in CAQDAS, and the willingness of government and private foundations to fund large qualitative projects.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health,4_not_prerequisites_barriers_facilitators_","",Barriers;Change;Computer Use;Data;Data Analysis;Educational Research;Financial Support;Innovation;Mixed Methods Research;Opportunities;Qualitative Research;Remedial Instruction;Sampling;State Colleges;Statistical Analysis;Technological Advancement,,,"5_adresses_government_health,4_not_prerequisites_barriers_facilitators_",,Excluded,Excluded,1

Video of teacher practice collected in four Victorian government schools was used as the basis for developing the framework. This footage was initially coded using Studiocode, a software tool that has been employed to analyse teacher practice in classrooms across the world, including by the International Centre for Classroom Research (ICCR), but not as far as we know used to analyse teacher practice in NGLEs through a human geographic or spatial lens. The paper describes the research methodology, the data collection methods and the analysis framework that was developed to represent data about the 'intersections' between people, space, practice and time i.e. the complex spatialized pedagogic practice of teachers in NGLEs. The practical dilemmas and hurdles that were encountered during the process of developing a simple coding system and visual tool that could represent teacher practice in NGLEs are discussed, along with the final analysis framework and representational tool that arose from the empirical data.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health","",Educational Research;Elementary Secondary Education;Foreign Countries;Research Methodology;Teaching Methods;Video Technology,,,"1 not sharing/ not using,5_adresses_government_health",,Excluded,Excluded,1

They no longer just manage their schools but must now be instructional leaders charged with observing and conferencing with teachers, leading professional development aligned to data, and measuring results. Classroom walkthroughs have become a way of assisting with these tasks while supporting the mission of each school. The purpose of this research was to describe how walkthroughs operate in practice and how they were experienced by school administration, teacher leaders, and teachers at two schools within the same suburban district. Interviews illustrated that experiences were varied using the classroom walkthrough protocol. Continued professional development needed to occur with administrators and teachers. Participants shared their thoughts on implementation and usage, as well as made recommendations to schools and/or districts considering implementing classroom walkthroughs. Results also indicated a great deal of attention paid to the collection of data within the schools but there was less consensus on the analysis and use of the collected data. There was also confusion with teachers as to the vision, purpose, and goals of using classroom walkthroughs. Changes in leadership during the five years since implementation and young administrators, who were relatively new in their positions, helped shape school experiences. Recommendations to schools and/or districts considering implementation focused on support from the district office, a need for help with data collection and analysis, and a clear vision for the use of the protocol. Interviewees mentioned it would benefit districts and schools to develop a shared vocabulary for instructional engagement, alignment, and rigor, as well as a focus for professional development. They also shared the view that calibration conferences and conversations, centered on instruction, provided a focus for teaching and learning within a school and/or district.

Research suggests that both data use and teacher collaboration are important ingredients in the school improvement process. Existing studies also reveal the complexities of teacher collaboration and the importance of context in shaping teachers' collaborative work, especially with data. Yet, the intersection of teacher collaboration and data use has been understudied. The purpose of this paper is to examine the affordances and constraints that exist in the context of established teacher collaboration time for the purposes of data-driven decision making. Design/methodology/approach: The paper draws upon qualitative case study data gathered in six schools that structured teacher time for collaboration on data use. Findings: An analysis of the data revealed that a variety of leadership activities and organizational conditions shaped teachers' collaborative work with data. These included leadership focused on thoughtful use of data and the framing of data-driven decision making in terms of collective responsibility; the establishment of norms for teacher collaboration; the implementation of data discussion protocols; and teacher groupings and subject matter subcultures. Originality/value: Knowing how and when a leadership activity or organizational condition becomes either an affordance or a constraint to teacher collaboration around data use has important implications for leadership and educational change. The findings of this study also help to lay the groundwork for future research regarding teacher collaboration around data use.

We discuss data use practices that influence equity goals: (1) accountability-driven data use and data use for continuous improvement; (2) using data to confirm assumptions and using data to challenge beliefs, and (3) tracking and flexible grouping to promote student growth. Along each of these dimensions, there are active decision makers, complex processes of data use at play, and a great deal of variation both within and across contexts. Ultimately, educators and policymakers are faced with critical choices regarding data use that can profoundly affect students' daily educational experiences and trajectories.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using,4_not_prerequisites_barriers_facilitators_","",Accountability;Data;Educational Improvement;Equal Education;Outcomes of Education;Qualitative Research,,,"1 not sharing/ not using,4_not_prerequisites_barriers_facilitators_",,Excluded,Excluded,1

In the United Kingdom, the National Health Service England launched an initiative in 2016, 'STopping Over-Medication of People with learning disabilities, autism or both (STOMP)', to address this concern. STOMP is supposed to encourage psychiatrists in the United Kingdom and elsewhere to rationalise psychotropic medication use in people with intellectual disabilities. The current study aims to gather UK psychiatrists' views and experience of implementing the STOMP initiative. Methods: An online questionnaire was sent to all UK psychiatrists working in the field of intellectual disabilities (estimated 225). Two open-ended questions allowed participants to write comments in response to these questions in the free text boxes. One question asked about the challenges psychiatrists faced locally to implement STOMP, and the other asked for examples of successes and positive experiences from the process. The free text data were analysed using a qualitative method with the help of the NVivo 12 plus software. Results: Eighty-eight (estimated 39\%) psychiatrists returned the completed questionnaire. The qualitative analysis of free-text data has shown variation within services in the experience and views of the psychiatrists. In areas with good support for STOMP implementation provided through adequate resources, psychiatrists reported satisfaction in the process with successful antipsychotic rationalisation, better local multi-disciplinary and multi-agency working, and increased awareness of STOMP issues among the stakeholders such as people with intellectual disabilities and their caregivers and multidisciplinary teams, and improved quality of life caused by reduced medication-related adverse events in people with intellectual disabilities. However, where resource utilisation is not optimum, psychiatrists seemed dissatisfied with the process with little success in medication rationalisation. Conclusions: Whereas some psychiatrists are successful and enthusiastic about rationalising antipsychotics, others still face barriers and challenges. Much work is needed to achieve a uniformly positive outcome throughout the United Kingdom.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health","",Adults;Drug Therapy;Experience;Federal Programs;Foreign Countries;Government Role;Intellectual Disability;Program Implementation;Psychiatry;Questionnaires;Antipsychotic Agents;Statistics as Topic,,,5_adresses_government_health,,Excluded,Excluded,1

These practices included identifying suitable physical training programmes, dyke monitoring, and the calibration of measurement instruments. The question addressed in this study is: How does a teaching and learning strategy based on authentic practices support students in making statistical inferences about authentic problems with the help of correlation and linear regression? To respond to this question we used video-recordings of lessons, audio-taped interviews, classroom field notes, and student work from a teaching experiment with 12 Dutch students (aged 16-17 years). The analysis provided insights into how the teaching and learning strategies based on authentic practices supported them to draw inferences about authentic problems using correlated data. The evidence illustrates how an understanding of the authentic problem being solved, collecting their own data to become acquainted with the situation, and learning to coordinate individual and aggregate views on data sets seemed to support these students in learning to draw inferences that make sense in the context.

According to conceptual change theory, learners sometimes hold knowledge, feelings, and beliefs that may be counterproductive to acquiring new knowledge, as a result addressing those variables is crucial to the learning process. Research on teachers suggests they often hold views that make them reluctant to learn more about or engage in DDDM (e.g.), but by tailoring instruction to address teacher concerns, they may become more open to DDDM (Airola \& Dunn, 2011). Our qualitative analysis and findings indicated our sample of preservice teachers did overwhelmingly hold initially negative views of DDDM, but our persuasive instructional unit created a cognitive shift away from this negativity and towards openness to and interest in DDDM.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using","",Attitude Change;Beliefs;Data Use;Educational Psychology;Instructional Effectiveness;Knowledge Base for Teaching;Misconceptions;Persuasive Discourse;Preservice Teachers;Professional Identity;Public Education;Student Attitudes;Decision Making,,,1 not sharing/ not using,,Excluded,Excluded,1

This article addresses this gap by examining how two types of education systems--school districts and charter management organizations (CMOs)--use data and allocate their organizational resources to this end. Methods: Data were collected from six secondary schools in two districts and two CMOs during the 2010-2011 school year. Over 70 interviews were conducted with teachers and school and system leaders. Patterns from within and across school systems are presented. Findings: Key contextual differences had a strong influence on data-use efforts: Accountability pressures shaped the patterns in data use, whereas other organizational conditions--structure and decision-making rights, size and growth trajectory, financial resources, and degree of regulation--restricted or facilitated the systems' mobilization of resources for these efforts. Implications: This study suggests that the school systems as a whole play a critical role in supporting schools and educators in using data, regardless of whether that system is district or charter. As this article is one of the first to offer a comparative look at data use between school districts and CMOs, it lays the groundwork for diffusion of promising practices across these systems for school and system leaders.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using","",Accountability;Administrative Organization;Case Studies;Charter Schools;Comparative Analysis;Data;Decision Making;Differences;Instructional Improvement;Qualitative Research;School Administration;School Districts;Secondary Schools;Semi Structured Interviews,,,1 not sharing/ not using,,Excluded,Excluded,1

However, health information exchange has not shared that same foundation in health care and related secondary uses, especially when the information is used for something other than diagnosis, treatment, or payment. This case study provides an in-depth examination of successful health data sharing for disability determination between three organizations: the US Social Security Administration (SSA), MedVirginia (a Health Information Exchange (HIE)), and the Office of the National Coordinator (ONC). In this case, use of SSA's MEGAHIT application (Medical Evidence Gathering and Analysis through Health Information Technology) and ONC's Nationwide Health Information Network (NwHIN) facilitated the electronic health data sharing from MedVirginia's electronic health records (EHRs). A Blended Value Collaboration Enactment Framework was used to understand the overall value proposition (answering the organizational question: """"What's in it for me?"""") from both social and economic perspectives along technical, organizational, and governance dimensions. This qualitative study consisted of 41 interviews and document analyses across the three organizations over a six-week period from July 2010-September 2010. Primary findings revealed that social motivations were prevalent in the original collaboration and a blend of social and economic motivations sustained the collaboration. Further findings showed that, as compared to previous medical evidence development methods, the use of MEGAHIT resulted in a 33\% time savings from disability application to SSA benefit approval. Such SSA benefits led to \$1.9 million in uncompensated care cost recovery for the provider. Supporting findings revealed that regular and consistent communication and structured governance are essential for creating a sustainable health information exchange collaboration. The findings illuminate the dynamic nature of social and economic blended value such that early motivations in health information exchange may not be the sustaining motivations; at some point in time a shift toward economic value occurs.

To document the effectiveness of the program, a follow-up survey was conducted in 1998 with an emphasis on the program's impact on students with disabilities, other teachers, and school districts. Surveys were returned from 29 former and current TREK participants. Results indicate that a significant number of participants had achieved an advanced degree or additional certification in some area of special education. A majority of respondents who indicated a job change felt that the change was due to their completion of the TREK course. On a scale  of 1 (not useful) to 5 (very useful), the range of scores across all courses was 4.4. Components of the three delivery formats--on-site, satellite, and compressed video--were rated, with the satellite and combination approach tying for preferred format, followed by compressed video and on-site. A greater percentage of participants were implementing best practices for children with disabilities after taking TREK courses, and a majority of these participants shared information about the practices with other adults. Nineteen respondents reported that systemic changes in their places of employment resulted from the knowledge they gained in the TREK program.

In order to meet this objective, the following questions framed this research: (1) How do individual teachers make meaning of the epistemological and dialogic aspects of their PLC's inquiry stance toward student data? (2) How do teachers interpret the influence of their personal inquiry stance toward student data on the stance of their PLC? and (3) How do teachers interpret the influence of external supports and constraints on their PLC's inquiry stance toward student data? The site of this research was a mid-sized Midwestern high school. The school had used the PLC structure for several years prior to this research. However, a new principal and assistant principal were hired for the 2016-2017 school year, which brought changes to the school's PLC processes. Eight teachers from five PLCs participated in qualitative, semi-structured interviews. Each participant was interviewed two times over the course of the second semester of the 2016-2017 school year. In addition, three PLCs were observed in meetings during the same time period. Finally, district, school and PLC documents were analyzed. Findings revealed that participants believed in an optimistic premise that professional collaboration had the potential to improve instruction and student learning. However, differences in the approach to knowledge and practice between individual teachers and their colleagues in the PLC, as well as constraints specific to the school context prevented participants from engaging in inquiry based on student-learning data to the degree desired. Participants experienced their PLC's epistemological and dialogic inquiry stance toward student-learning data as a proving stance. Much of their PLC work centered around the development of student learning goals aligned to the Common Core curriculum. When student data was discussed in the PLC, participants experienced the data process as proving the effectiveness of past instruction and generalizing student understanding of past instruction. In addition to spending the majority of the PLC time on the development of student learning goals, participants described much of their conversation centering around task completion, with the PLC agenda directing the work. Differences in participants' experiences of stance toward knowledge and practice emerged from this research. Tension existed in how knowledge was privileged. Participant responses demonstrated a belief that a set of best practices for professional collaboration existed, and the teachers felt they were expected to learn these best practices and implement the practices in their work. Participants also placed value in knowledge gained through classroom experience, and some participants expressed concern that the knowledge gained through experience was not valued in the school system. The tension between formal knowledge in the form of best practices and knowledge gained through experience was described as a concern or frustration specific to the context of the school that made inquiry in PLC work much more difficult than anticipated. The frustration with the difficulty of implementation of PLC work and the tension between different stances toward knowledge and practice resulted in tangible negative effects on the participants in this study. Social relationships were damaged. Some teachers sought compliance with perceived directives and mandates. Other teachers decided to question those same perceptions. Still others remained committed to collaboration and waited for teachers they considered to be resistant to leave the school so that replacements could be hired with compatible beliefs. Despite the difficulties and concerns expressed, all the participants expressed a belief that collaboration with colleagues was important to them socially and professionally. Their concerns were with the nature of implementation not the nature of collaboration. Through purposeful discussions on data processes and the ways in which differing stances toward knowledge and practice influence perception, it remains possible for teachers to experience an increasing sense of collective efficacy in their collaborative work. The results of this study revealed four practical strategies for school leaders to promote collaborative inquiry in schools. These strategies include developing structures that support collaborative inquiry, developing a shared vision that supports collaborative inquiry, developing data processes that support authentic collaborative inquiry, and promoting political and social conditions that support collaborative inquiry. This study also revealed two implications for teachers who participate in PLCs. The strategies for teachers include on-going reflection on images of knowledge and practice and on-going engagement in learning. In addition, the findings revealed suggestions for the use of this case study in both administrator and teacher preparation programs.

Do graduates find jobs? What are they paid? What will they earn in the future? Despite growing national interest in this information, good answers are not widely available for many programs. As college costs have soared in recent years, """"unmet financial need"""" (the share of college costs not covered by financial aid or what the family is expected to contribute) has also climbed sharply. Rising costs and increased student debt, combined with a weak economy, make college a riskier investment than in the past. Students and families can reduce that risk by gauging the quality of institutions and programs and choosing carefully among fields of study. Armed with better information about post-graduation outcomes, low-income and first-generation students and their families are more likely to consider the full range of programs and institutions that can help them succeed. This paper focuses on the need for better information about post-graduation outcomes of postsecondary education and training, with a particular focus on workforce results. Workforce results include employment-related outcomes, such as post-graduation employment rates and earnings levels. Survey research and other evidence reviewed below shows that consumers are keenly interested in these outcomes. This paper suggests the types of employment measures and data that would help meet this demand for better information and describes recent progress by states in producing more comprehensive and consistent information about labor market results. Federal and state policymakers are grappling with the best ways to improve employment data and incorporate metrics into higher education policy. Developing a fair, accurate method for measuring and presenting workforce results should be a top priority for institutions and policymakers at all levels of government.

The purpose of this toolkit is to provide educators with a purposeful and systematic way to elicit and listen to student voice to inform school improvement efforts. School improvement is complex work that relies on multiple sources of information to frame challenges and address and monitor change efforts. Student voice brings an additional, important source of information to these efforts. The toolkit offers three tools. ASK (Analyzing Surveys with Kids) involves students in analyzing and interpreting survey results associated with a school-related topic or problem and then producing suggestions for school improvement. Inside-Outside Fishbowl organizes a special kind of focus group in which students and educators trade roles as speakers and listeners during a facilitated discussion of a school-related topic or problem, and jointly develop an action plan. S4 (Students Studying Students' Stories) guides a digital storytelling process in which students produce and analyze videotaped interviews of other students about a school-related topic or problem and then host forums with educators to suggest improvements. The toolkit includes detailed information about how the tools work, the questions they address, the number and types of participants needed, the amount of time required, space and materials considerations, and directions for using the tools. It also includes a tool template so schools and districts can create new student voice tools for their particular needs and interests.

Four types of graphs are emphasized--bar, picture, line, and circle or area. The hypothesis is that students in elementary and intermediate grades are generally insufficiently prepared to use graphs effectively, although they are expected to use them as data sources on a regular basis, particularly in social studies classes. This hypothesis is based on a review of literature on uses of graphs with school age children and on an analysis of three social studies textbook series (18 books). This analysis revealed that 124 graphs were presented with very little background information on graphing knowledge and/or skills. To help social studies classroom teachers overcome this  deficiency, information is presented for the four types of graphs on uses, construction, evaluation, type of graph paper, derivation of the data used in the sample graphs, follow-up activities, and interpretation. Teaching strategies are also suggested, including types of questions teachers should ask to guide students through the process of analyzing a graph (open, focus, interpretive, and capstone). Examples of questions are (1) """"What is the graph about?"""" (open question), (2) """"What do the numbers arranged along the vertical axis mean?"""" (focus question), (3) """"What happened at a specific date to produce a given effect?"""" (interpretive question), and (4) """"What conclusions can be drawn from this data?"""" (capstone question).

There are a number of ways to manage or reduce resistance to providing data, which would be appropriate for the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES): (1) reduce the data reporting burden by sampling  only a portion of local education agencies; (2) employ contractors rather than agencies to conduct the surveys; (3) distribute useful reports from the surveys to the participants; (4) enlist Congressional support; (5) reduce the number of surveys conducted by the Office for Civil Rights (OCR); and (6) approach and negotiate with chief state school officers individually, not as a group.

Districts and schools across the United States are under a great deal of pressure to collect and analyze data in hopes of identifying student weaknesses to implement corrective action plans that will lead to overall student achievement in the classroom. Technology tools such as computer-based assessment and reporting systems have provided schools with immediate access to student-level data. The problem is the lack of direction in how to use the information to make instructional changes in the classroom. A review of literature provided an overview of research-based strategies that support data-driven decision making (DDDM) in the classroom. Three case studies in Louisiana were examined to build a conceptual understanding about how districts and schools use data to make informed decisions. Three research questions guided the investigation and focused on the tools used to assess, store, and retrieve student data, evidence that connects the data and improvements in teaching, and recommendations for other districts and schools. Educational practices were documented through a collection of documents, interview/questionnaire data, and physical artifacts. Results were reported in a question and answer format for three case studies. School administrators reported using data to plan, evaluate, and provide feedback to teachers. In contrast, teachers and instructional specialists revealed that data were used to assess and measure student's weekly performance. All schools utilized at least two computer-based assessment and/or reporting systems to manage student-level data within the district and/or school. Instructional coaches provided direct support to teachers. Data analysis revealed that teachers collaborated and supported each other through data team meetings and working sessions. Principals and teachers monitored student behavior through use of data management and reporting tools. Schools showed promising and positive attitudes about making changes and building a data-driven culture. Findings were supported through current research on DDDM.

Although professional learning is often cited as an important facilitator of effective data use, research that focuses on the intersection of professional learning and data use is scarce. Examining teacher perceptions of data use supports, and contrasting assertions of what is desired in data-related professional learning with accounts of the ways in which this professional learning actually happens provide an avenue for exploring these issues and for building a research base that can inform the work of district and campus leaders as well as support providers. Focus of Study: This study aimed at examining teacher needs specific to data-related professional learning through a lens informed by knowledge-based organizational learning. We were guided by two broad questions: (a) What knowledge and skills do teachers need in order to engage in data-informed practice? (b) How do professional learning supports address these needs? Research Design: The qualitative study draws on document analysis as well as interview and focus group data collected from n = 110 participants (teachers, school leaders, and district support staff) in three school districts in central Texas. Flexible a priori coding rooted in our conceptual framework was employed to examine data for themes common across district settings and across school levels (e.g., elementary, middle, high). Code counts were used to further examine areas of professional learning focus and/or apparent imbalance. Findings: Educators articulated professional learning needs related to data use in six main areas: (a) asking appropriate questions of data (to guide analysis and use); (b) accessing and operating district data systems; (c) data literacy/interpretation; (d) fitting data use with day-do-day practice; (e) sharing information via collaboration; and (f) knowledge codification. Of these, data capture via computer data systems was by far the most prominent focus reported by educators in each district. Clear plans for addressing data use capacity through professional learning supports were lacking. Recommendations: Taking into account teacher perspectives on what professional learning for data use was needed and on how such supports were, in reality, structured, we make three recommendations: (a) purposefully embed professional learning for data use in ongoing organizational routines; (b) mitigate the district level silos that separate training-on-computer-systems from professional learning focused on turning data into action at the classroom level; and (c) seek balance in supporting the constellation of knowledge and skills that contribute to data use capacity.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 4_not_prerequisites_barriers_facilitators_","",Access to Information;Cooperation;Data;Elementary School Teachers;Faculty Development;Focus Groups;Information Literacy;Information Systems;Information Utilization;Interviews;Learning;Nursing;Organizational Culture;Qualitative Research;Secondary School Teachers,,,4_not_prerequisites_barriers_facilitators_,,Excluded,Excluded,1

These tools, enabled by the advent of cloud-based geographic information systems (GIS) technology, bring problem solving, critical thinking, and spatial analysis to every classroom instructor and student. Because modern web GIS platforms are open for anyone to contribute, data quality runs the gamut from poor and/or a complete lack of metadata to authoritative, curated, well-documented sources. Therefore, students need to be critical in using online maps, examining the source, date, author, and other pertinent information.

The quantitative goals seek to find a possible degree of convergence with the course completion average grade. Qualitative data from 10 high school students, their teachers, and quantitative data from their courses were gathered. Quantitative data from the learning management system (LMS) was reproduced, scrubbed of unwanted data, such as dropped students. Mixed method constant comparison was performed to determine a descriptive analysis of three variables: student achievement, student interaction, and social elements. Using the data gathered from the qualitative interviews, a yes or no was assigned to the students for behavioral, cognitive, and social skills. Using descriptive statistics, the skills were compared to the students' course grades. The results revealed a strong pattern match of data for Research Question 1. This data was indicative of the need for behavioral, cognitive, and social skills to complete an online course. Quantitative and teacher data were grouped by themes: asynchronous, administrative, and assessments; synchronous added for teacher data. A constant comparison of data correspondence was performed between the student course average grade, the access data, LMS theme data, and the course average final grade. The investigation of Research Question 2 indicated that the LMS's reporting module can determine interactions to support online course completion by providing average grade analysis along with access analysis and tool usage analysis.

Most types of schools are operated by local school committees. Financing of education comes from the National Government and the Municipalities. Compulsory schooling begins at the age of seven and lasts for seven years. Because a number of types of older secondary schools exist, there are  several paths open to the student --upper secondary schools, vocational schools, or art and music schools.

Generating accurate, useful, and impactful models of past, current, and future states of ecosystem structure and function is a complex endeavor that often requires vast amounts of data from multiple sources and knowledge from collaborating researchers. Ecological data collection has improved rapidly over the past few decades due to the development, innovation, and large scale deployment of automated sensors, which are capable of measuring a gamut of ecosystem properties over broad spatiotemporal scales. Although complex ecosystem models and analyses are increasingly parameterized with data from such sensors, the challenges of managing, analyzing, and sharing large data sets remain for this field of research. The goals of this research were to: 1) better identify and understand challenges that academic ecological research groups face when incorporating automated sensors into their research, and 2) improve capacities for the fusion and analysis of multifarious ecological data from multiple sources. To address the first goal, a nationwide survey of ecologists was conducted to elucidate how academic research groups are deploying sensors, managing sensor data, collaborating with major research networks, and publishing their data, results, and other findings. The survey feedback from over 100 research groups from 82 academic institutions showed that academic ecological research groups are collectively using thousands of sensors in the field--a number comparable to a large research network--and would like to more than double their sensor use. However, in addition to being limited by funding, they also identified that they are limited in information management knowledge and tools that would help them make their data permanently archived and made available for reuse. To address the second goal, a case study was performed to explore, identify, and prototype solutions to challenges faced by typical academic ecological research groups when streamlining data processing and management. By reviewing the operations of the heavily-instrumented UTEP Systems Ecology Lab research site at the Jornada Experimental Range, NM, a need was identified for a web-based information management system that allows for interaction with spatial layers, imagery, and time-series data. Working collaboratively with a team of ecologists and computer scientists, a prototype web mapping and information system was developed using several free and/or open-source products that are freely available for use and modification by the ecological community. The system consists of i) a generic database well suited for storing and fusing multifarious ecological datasets from multiple sources and for supporting multiple interest areas and personnel; ii) a web-mapping application that allows users to query and dynamically view and interact with a variety of spatial data imagery and time-series data; and iii) specialized, open-source data analysis software (written in R, a programming language familiar to many ecologists) that can be implemented within the information management framework. The """"long-tail"""" of ecological research, where many small research groups collectively make a large contribution to the body of knowledge that help us understand, manage, and adapt to our changing earth system is steadily becoming more data-intensive. This research highlights and addresses some of the challenges that need to be overcome by the academic ecological research community to make their data reusable for collaborative science. The dissertation concludes by discussing future research challenges associated with the management of large, multifarious ecological data and connecting the activities of numerous but relatively small academic research groups to national research efforts.

Teachers and building leaders routinely use interim assessment data to develop thoughtful and robust instructional plans that address identified areas of student need. The link between the interim assessment data collection and student learning includes the pedagogical changes that teachers implement based on the data from these interim assessments. However, teachers do not always know how to use the data for this purpose or do not always make necessary changes in their instruction. As a result, student achievement goes unchanged. The purpose of this evaluative qualitative case study was to explore how high school teachers used interim assessment data to evaluate their instruction, and if, or how they made resulting changes in that instruction as they prepared students for the Virginia Reading, Literature, and Research (RLR), as well as the Algebra I, II, and Geometry Standards of Learning (SOL) assessments in one school located in Virginia. A secondary purpose of the study was to explore the pedagogical changes teachers had made, if any, in response to reviewing this data. The discovery process highlighted how the teachers used the interim assessment data, their own content knowledge, and pedagogical skills to change their instructional approaches to the content based on the interim assessment feedback.

This paper begins to redress this imbalance by reporting two studies using a technique involving self-recorded audio cassette tape used along with conventional qualitative data collection methods. The studies involved 2 groups of 64 and 40 students, respectively who were taking courses given by the British Open University in Milton Keynes, England.

Usage data, or """"paradata,"""" such as reviews, ratings, views, downloads, favorites, and shares, may yield insight into the fit.

We conducted sentiment analyses of user reviews and correlations between the sentiment scores and data elements. Some relationships between NSDL paradata elements suggested aspects of resource fit. Despite prior research indicating that user reviews tended to be strongly positive or strongly negative, the results of this study indicated that educators left feedback that contained a blend of sentiments and that users usually downloaded resources they viewed. The results of this study suggest that while it is unlikely that educator feedback can currently be used to assess resource quality, with larger and more robust usage data sets, this area is a fertile area for further research into nuanced sentiment.

rayyan-1093358150,Understanding {{How Principals Use Data Dashboards}} to {{Inform Systemic School Improvement}},2016,,"","","",,,"","Marker, Kathryn Christner","","","","","Because data access may be perceived by principals as overwhelming or irrelevant rather than helpful (Wayman, Spikes, \& Volonnino, 2013), data access does not guarantee effective data use. The data-based decision making literature has largely focused on teacher use of data, considering less often data-based organizational improvements for the school as a whole with the inherent focus on the role of the principal. The purpose of this study was to articulate the theory of change (Carman, 2010; Weiss, 1997a) which underlies the connection between accessing data via a dashboard, and the successful use of data to inform decision making by K-12 principals in their schools. This study's research question asked what knowledge, skills, and dispositions contribute to effective use of data dashboards by principals for school improvement. To answer that question, basic interpretive qualitative methods (Denzin \& Lincoln, 1994; Merriam, 2002) were first used to outline the nature of dashboard use according to experts in industries where dashboards have a longer history and a more robust data technology literature base than in education. Then, with a case study design (Creswell, 2007; Merriam, 1988; Stake, 1995) and a focus on a data dashboard implementation in North Carolina, this study elicited program theory from North Carolina stakeholders. Data from interviews, observations, and documents were analyzed to articulate a theory of change and create (a) a logic model (a visual diagram) of how the dashboard is expected to facilitate data access and result in effective decision making, as well as (b) a logic model illustrating the theory-practice gap. Results of the study led to recommendations specifically for principals, ranging from developing spreadsheet skills to leveraging dashboards for situational awareness (Few, 2013; Marzano, Waters, \& McNulty, 2005). In addition, the findings suggest that education planners should seek a true dashboard and refuse to settle for an interface offering a single sign-on to multiple software products. Further, schools need a framework for the action subsequent to data-based decision making. In the discussion of these findings, the study highlights the connection of Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) to principals and dashboards and offers insights from the business research literature about process improvement. This study has implications not only for the professional development of principals but also for the improvement of dashboard technology implementations, and for an expanded understanding of the potentially transformative impact of dashboards on decision making.

Proponents argue that the addition of covariates allows fairer comparisons of schools, whereas opponents argue that it excuses poorly performing schools and obscures policy-relevant school differences. School-level covariates are problematic statistically, but it has been argued that mean school prior achievement should be included in school effects analyses to reduce error. This article reports on school effects analyses of Australia-wide data of approximately 1.5 million students in both primary and secondary schools that took national assessments in five achievement domains between 2013 and 2018. With appropriate controls for prior achievement, school effects are generally small and most often not statistically significant. The addition of student-level covariates: further reduces school effects, since part of the school effects is absorbed by the effects of the covariates, which are unlikely to reflect causal social processes; reduces the proportion of schools with significant school effects; does not improve predictive power; increases the amount of missing data; and further reduces the consistency of school effects between domains and their stability over time. Mean school prior achievement did not improve consistency or stability.

Vignettes are descriptions of situations or problems written by a professional, with a suggested outline and comments provided by a researcher. Advantages of this method are strength of impact of the written descriptions and efficiency of use of researchers' time; limitations are possible bias or reluctance on the part of the professional, and necessity of a good working relationship between professional and researcher. Suggested applications of this technique include formal research, problem solving, and policy planning. Illustrations of the use of this technique in a teacher center show the vividness of descriptions, as well as the potential for effective intervention.  In the pre-structured case method, the researcher writes a case outline, including a display format, before collecting any data. The data, when collected, are entered directly into the display format. Advantages of this method include efficiency of use of researchers' time, and availability of interim feedback and cross-case analysis. Limitations include necessity of knowledgeable, experienced researchers; and risk of researcher bias and of drawing conclusions too soon. Suggested applications of this method include evaluation studies and studies testing theoretical models. It is also suggested that pairs of researchers be used to limit possible bias and """"tunnel vision""""; and that transcribed, rather than coded, field notes, be entered.

Participants of this study consisted of the student population enrolled in English classes from grades 9 to 11 in an urban high school with total student enrollment of 2,445 in school year 2011-2012, of which 697 were ELLs. A retrospective control group design was used to analyze the data collected before and after the intervention period. The measurement tools utilized were the test performance of the students in the English Language Arts portion of the California Standardized tests (CST) and the California High School Exit Exam (CAHSEE). The findings from this study indicate that the intervention had a significant positive effect on the CST ELA scores of the ELLs versus the RFEP students. However, the intervention did not have a significant effect on the CAHSEE ELA scores of the ELLs versus the RFEP students. Moreover, there was no interaction between the language placement and the intervention for either the CST or CAHSEE.

School districts and private companies that sell their services to the education market now regularly collect such information, raising significant issues about the privacy rights of students. Most school districts lack the resources to manage all of the student data that federal and state laws now require that they collect and report. As a result, they are likely to hire private vendors to identify, collect, manage, and analyze student data. This has opened up opportunities for private vendors to access student information and to share it with others. Further, the computerization of student work offers opportunities for companies that provide education technology and educational applications to obtain and pass on to third parties information about students. Which information may be appropriately collected, who has a right to see it, how long the information may be held, and how errors and inaccuracies are to be corrected have become critical policy issues. Important in this mix is that student information, even information in the form of """"anonymized"""" meta-data (or massive amounts of data reported without linking specific information and individuals), is valuable to marketers interested in selling products and services to students and their families. Because of these critical concerns, this year's report on school commercializing trends reviews the policy landscape related to student data and assesses the dangers associated with the dearth of policies to protect students and their families from third parties who wish to profit from access to information collected through schools. As legislators develop statutory language and district leaders develop their contracting policies, the authors recommend that they review the comprehensive guidelines detailed in the Electronic Privacy Information Center's Student Privacy Bill of Rights. The authors also recommend that policymakers develop policies that encompass not only the privacy of student educational records but also the wide variety of student data (including anonymized data that may now be collected and shared). These policies should explicitly address the potential commercial use of any data collected. Finally, the authors recommend that the burden of protecting student data be placed not only on schools and districts but also on any private vendors with access to student data. This would align the interests of all parties, public and private, in protecting student privacy.

Almost all respondents identified multiple sources of stress in their teaching work, and these stress factors occurred repeatedly and concurrently. Three key areas of stress teachers identified were (1) increasing difficulty and complexity of teaching and relating to students (e.g., changing class composition and working with impoverished students); (2) the volume of work during a teacher's day and the expectations that teachers will  address a wide range of tasks and issues (e.g., seasonal pressures, curriculum change, and expectations); and (3) lack of time, resources, support, and respect. The consequences of high workload stress include trying to cope, working excessively or opting for part-time employment, quitting teaching, becoming sick, and negative effects on family life.

Through the use of critical social theory and critical theory of education as guiding frameworks, the dissertation examines an instantiation of STEM reform efforts to analyze the classroom participation structure that emerged in a piloted introduction to data science course at a local high school in one of the largest school districts in the country. The study is particularly concerned with identifying emergent classroom norms and practices, and understanding whether and how they came to support and/or hinder students' opportunities to learn richly with data through an analysis of the development of student learning identities. This qualitative case study draws on audio-recorded student interviews, video-recorded classroom observations, and field notes collected during the second year of the curriculum's implementation. To identify classroom norms and practices as they relate to the development of student identities as data science doers, the study examines the classroom participation structure (Cobb and Hodge, 2002) and employs Cobb, Gresalfi, and Hodge's (2009) interpretive scheme for analyzing the development of mathematical student identity (also see Cobb \& Hodge, 2010). While the multiperspectival approach of this study will provide innovatively insightful contributions to a number of fields including education, cultural studies, data and computer science, the study will also push how educators, learning science researchers, curriculum writers, and policymakers think about the pursuit of equity in STEM education in general and data science-oriented programs and initiatives in particular as they relate to STEM reform efforts.

We examine video and audio data from groups within a lab session where students were expected to find data inconsistent with the predictions of two models. In prior work, we examined the actions of the four groups that productively grapple with this designed problem. Here, we analyze the engagement of the three groups that do not.

Our phase 1 and 2 analyses show only minor differences between the groups that engaged with the problem and those that did not. Our phase 3 analysis demonstrated that the groups that did not engage with the problem framed the lab activity as about confirming a known result or as a series of hoops to jump through to fulfill assignment requirements.

The 51 students, aged 15 and commencing post-compulsory science education in the Netherlands, were able to carry out basic skills such as collecting data and representing these. In interpreting the data in terms of the investigated phenomenon or situation however, performance was weak. Students often appeared to be unable to identify the crucial features of a given graph. Conclusions based on the data were often tautological or superficial, lacking salient features. Students failed to infer implications from the data, to interpret data at a higher level of abstraction, or to specify limitations to the validity of the analysis or conclusions.

The program also seeks to create leadership opportunities and increase public awareness to address disparities in girls' access to sports. This report presents findings from data collected over the last five years from the Women's Sports Foundation's Sports 4 Life grantees. The Sports 4 Life evaluation team developed several research tools customized to measure strength in the key objectives identified by the national and regional initiatives, and to examine these objectives from the perspectives of multiple stakeholders--the girls who participate, their program leaders, and community stakeholders. These tools, combined with qualitative data drawn from interviews, think tanks that brought together regional partners and the WSF to identify key regional priorities, and open-ended survey questions, provide a robust account of Sports 4 Life's contributions to the field of positive sports youth development.

Through rigorous analysis, data can illuminate the complexity of human behavior, inform interventions, and give voice to people's lived experiences. While significant progress has been made in advancing the rigor of qualitative analysis, the process often remains nebulous. To better understand how our field conducts and reports qualitative analysis, we reviewed qualitative articles published in """"Health Education \& Behavior"""" between 2000 and 2015. Two independent reviewers abstracted information in the following categories: data management software, coding approach, analytic approach, indicators of trustworthiness, and reflexivity. Of the 48 (n = 48) articles identified, the majority (n = 31) reported using qualitative software to manage data. Double-coding transcripts was the most common coding method (n = 23); however, nearly one third of articles did not clearly describe the coding approach. Although the terminology used to describe the analytic process varied widely, we identified four overarching trajectories common to most articles (n = 37). Trajectories differed in their use of inductive and deductive coding approaches, formal coding templates, and rounds or levels of coding. Trajectories culminated in the iterative review of coded data to identify emergent themes. Few articles explicitly discussed trustworthiness or reflexivity. Member checks (n = 9), triangulation of methods (n = 8), and peer debriefing (n = 7) were the most common procedures. Variation in the type and depth of information provided poses challenges to assessing quality and enabling replication. Greater transparency and more intentional application of diverse analytic methods can advance the rigor and impact of qualitative research in our field.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health","",Coding;Computer Software;Credibility;Data Analysis;Educational Research;Health Behavior;Health Education;Health Promotion;Information Management;Journal Articles;Qualitative Research;Reliability;Research Design;Validity;Health Educators,,,5_adresses_government_health,,Excluded,Excluded,1

Research Method: This qualitative study used one-on-one semistructured interviews with the principals focusing on how they disaggregate data in practice. The protocol included general questions about principals' data practices as well as specific questions around disaggregation. Initial inductive coding began with principals' direct responses to specific questions around disaggregation, and then emerging themes were used to analyze the entire transcripts. Findings: Participants were more likely to talk about disaggregation in relation to performance (by teacher, by grade level, etc.) than by subgroup (by race/ethnicity, by gender, etc.). Further analysis highlighted principals' purposes for disaggregating data that focused on identifying low performance on standards-based assessments, as well as the challenges they faced, particularly in terms of technical skills and software. Implications for Research and Practice: We conclude with a discussion of how disaggregation could support or challenge equity-focused leadership, with implications for policy, practice, and preparation. We consider the role of the principal in identifying inequitable patterns versus focusing on individual students, and different ways that equity can become part of regular leadership practice.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using","",Academic Achievement;Accountability;Administrator Attitudes;Data Analysis;Decision Making;Educational Legislation;Educational Policy;Elementary Secondary Education;Equal Education;Federal Legislation;Instructional Leadership;Outcomes of Education;Phenomenology;Principals;School Districts;Standards;State Policy;Technological Literacy,,,1 not sharing/ not using,,Excluded,Excluded,1

A simple derivation is given for the Hohmann transfer velocity boost that introductory students can derive on their own with a little teacher guidance. They can then use the SpaceX telemetry data to verify the theoretical results, finding the discrepancy between observation and theory to be 3\% or less.

In order to provide data comparable across states to the maximum extent feasible, NCES and representatives of the SEAs have worked since the 1950s to develop and accept common data items and definitions. School, agency, and state education data for the CCD are collected through the U.S. Department of Education's Education Data Exchange Network (EDEN). The data are edited by the U.S. Census Bureau and maintained in machine-readable datasets by NCES. They are used to produce general-purpose publications and specialized reports. The principal users of CCD nonfiscal data are the federal government; the education research community; state and local government officials, including school boards and local education agency (LEA) administrators; and the general public. The purpose of the CCD nonfiscal surveys is to provide a listing of all open schools and agencies providing free public elementary and secondary education, along with basic descriptive statistical information on each school and agency listed. The CCD includes all settings in which free public education is provided to children. However, some SEAs do not provide information on education outside of the traditional public school system--such as schools in correctional facilities or hospitals--while others do provide this information. The Public Elementary/Secondary School Universe file includes data for the following variables: NCES school ID number, state school ID number, name of the school, name of the agency that operates the school, mailing address, physical location address, phone number, school type, operational status, locale code, latitude, longitude, county number, county name, full-time-equivalent (FTE) classroom teacher count, low/high grade span offered, Congressional district code, school level , free lunch eligible students, reduced-price lunch eligible students, total free and reduced-price lunch eligible, migrant students enrolled in the previous year, student totals and detail (by grade, by race/ethnicity, and by gender), and pupil/teacher ratio.

Data are reported on academic achievement in school report cards each year. Administrators use data for curricular and evaluative purposes. Teachers are provided with data to improve their pedagogy. All of this data is based on student academic performance; however, students rarely ever see or use any of the data. Students have limited access to their own data and yet they are under tremendous pressure to perform well and demonstrate growth in achievement each year. Ultimately, there is a current focus of students as producers of data with a lack of attention on students as consumers of data. With limited access to their own data, there is little research on students using data. This study, therefore, fills a void in the current research on students using data.    A quasi-experimental mixed methods research design was used to explore students' experiences in using data in a mathematics classroom, their attitudes in using data, and how it affected their learning experience. Ninety-six eighth grade middle school students from a Nassau County, Long Island, suburban, middle school participated in the study, 49 in an intervention group and 47 in a control group. Quantitative data were collected through a survey that measured attitudes towards mathematics. In addition, academic performance on New York State Assessments, midterm exams, and final exams were collected on student participants in order to compare the control group and the intervention group and to see differences in performance based on gender, math support, and math course. Qualitative data were collected through interviews and focus groups from students in the intervention group. In addition, archival and anecdotal data were also collected.    This research study revealed an overall positive experience in students receiving data on their mathematical academic performance throughout the year. Students gained a better understanding of the data analysis process, became more self-aware of their personal math ability, became empowered as a learner, used data to be more time efficient in their study, and expressed a positive emotional impact as a result of using data in their mathematics class. The use of data was also found to have an impact on attitudes towards mathematics as well as on academic achievement.    Exploring student use of data is critical today, as accountability is the cornerstone of education today. Students need to take on a greater responsibility for their learning and we have not given them the opportunity to do so. It is our responsibility to allow students access to their data and train them how to use it in such a way to improve their learning. This is the future of assessment and it is important for us to understand the power of putting the learning into the hand of students. Students and teachers need to work together as they gather data, create meaning of data, and provide appropriate feedback to each other in order to impact learning. This research will hope to inspire students and teachers to work together in a partnership of data users.

This student performance modeling problem is a critical step for building adaptive online teaching systems. Specifically, we conduct a study of how to utilize various types and large amounts of log data from earlier students to train accurate machine learning models that predict the performance of future students. This study is the first to use four very large sets of student data made available recently from four distinct intelligent tutoring systems. Our results include a new machine learning approach that defines a new state of the art for logistic regression based student performance modeling, improving over earlier methods in several ways: First, we achieve improved accuracy of student modeling by introducing new features that can be easily computed from conventional question-response logs (e.g., features such as the pattern in the student's most recent answers). Second, we take advantage of features of the student history that go beyond question-response pairs (e.g., features such as which video segments the student watched, or skipped) as well as background information about prerequisite structure in the curriculum. Third, we train multiple specialized student performance models for different aspects of the curriculum (e.g., specializing in early versus later segments of the student history), then combine these specialized models to create a group prediction of the student performance. Taken together, these innovations yield an average AUC score across these four datasets of 0.808 compared to the previous best logistic regression approach score of 0.767, and also outperforming state-of-the-art deep neural net approaches. Importantly, we observe consistent improvements from each of our three methodological innovations, in each diverse dataset, suggesting that our methods are of general utility and likely to produce improvements for other online tutoring systems as well.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using","",Academic Achievement;Artificial Intelligence;Electronic Learning;Elementary Secondary Education;Foreign Countries;Intelligent Tutoring Systems;Models;Predictor Variables,,,1 not sharing/ not using,,Excluded,Excluded,1

New to the options available to K-12 parents are full-time virtual schools, and this option is an even more recent development for parents of students with disabilities. Very little research exists on why parents are choosing full-time virtual education for their school-aged children, and almost no research exists on why parents of students with disabilities (Grades K-12) are choosing this option. This descriptive, nonexperimental exploratory study sought to answer the following research questions: (1) What factors led parents to enroll their child with disabilities in an online virtual charter school?; (2) Were these factors attributable to positive characteristics of the virtual charter school in which the child was enrolling, or were the factors attributable to negative characteristics of the school the child was leaving?; and (3) Do the factors identified by parents vary by parents' race/ethnicity, parent educational levels, or student disability? This study suggests that parents of student with disabilities students chose a virtual charter school for their children due to pull factors related to California Connections Academy (CALCA). Specifically, parents seemed most interested in being able to individualize education for their children and being able to instill their values in their children by educating them at home. Emphases on teaching the basics and on teacher quality were also important factors for parents. Attention should also be given to the several factors (bullying, Special Education/504 Plans, teacher attributes, and quality curriculum) that parents took extra effort to mention in the open-ended response items. Implications for practice, future research, and policy are discussed. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

Concept inventories are an example of psychometric instruments used to probe students' content knowledge within a defined framework. Concept inventories have been used as a measure of student understanding in science education for over two decades. The Chemical Concepts Inventory (CCI), published in 2002, is one of the most often referenced inventories in chemical education. However, not until the past year has detailed psychometric evidence been published about data from the instrument. Although this prior study focused on quantitative evidence to support the CCI as a whole, there are still no qualitative studies published to investigate the reasoning behind students' responses. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the response process validity of the CCI in order to understand the nature of student responses. In addition to evaluating individual items, this study examined the content validity of the CCI as a whole instrument. To do this, a survey was employed to understand expert judgments about the content being covered on the CCI. This information was used to group items by content prior to investigating student responses. It was found that a majority of the content on the CCI was limited to only two concepts (phase change and conservation of mass-matter). Student reasoning for their responses to items from these groupings was examined through think-aloud interviews.

This study aims to explore first-year university students' ability to properly use simple descriptive statistics and data visualization. Qualitative data were collected using a set of questions from 39 undergraduate students. Many students were able to calculate various descriptive statistics, but some of them were still unable to determine suitable statistics to describe the data clearly. Related to data visualization, many students failed to provide a meaningful chart that effectively shows the difference between two groups of data. Students with higher statistical literacy tend to use comparison or variability reasoning to determine the usage of descriptive statistics, and use data-based reason in visualizing the data. Improvement in statistical teaching -- both in the university and the secondary school -- is needed so that the students can use descriptive statistics and data visualization correctly.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using","",College Freshmen;Data Analysis;Foreign Countries;Statistics Education;Student Attitudes;Visual Aids,,,1 not sharing/ not using,,Excluded,Excluded,1

This research study examines the questions:    What are the characteristics of systems and leadership in identified K-12 public schools with reputations for strong educational technology use? Specifically, (1) in what ways do leaders in these identified schools leverage enGauge program evaluation data to inform technology policy and practice? (2) what leadership practices and contextual factors are evident in these identified schools that support strong educational technology use?    Ten emerging themes and major program attributes emerged from this research. Necessary leadership qualities, or leadership areas to leverage, from the study include: (1) a vision for educational technology use for all students by all teachers; (2) accountability to achieve the vision; (3) leveraging the role of the Library Media Specialist(s) and the passionate advocate(s); (4) creating a viable funding model for acquiring and maintaining technology; (5) providing professional development for leaders with position authority concerning data-driven decision making techniques and strategies; (6) attention to creating classroom and common areas that promote educational technology use through building construction and renovation projects; and (7) working with State and Federal leaders to develop and implement policies that have a positive impact educational technology use.    This case study of four K-12 public school districts identifies educational technology leadership best practices and major program attributes that are data driven, research informed, and connected to high-quality programs, relevant to local, state, and national application. Future research should examine these findings in light of new and emerging technologies, the increased role of state and federal governments, and the continued worldwide movement towards a technology- and information-rich global society.

We demonstrate how these research traditions are united in their aim to, first, uncover meaningful themes and, subsequently, to understand those themes' relationships to each other. To illustrate our approach, we present research on video gamers' understandings of productive and detrimental responses to failure. Initial themes, cultural models, and grounded theory analysis of 10 semi-structured interviews led us to the theory that video games help players learn to cope more productively with failure, which we confirmed in a subsequent content analysis of text extracts from an online survey (N = 64). Overall, we propose that commonly employed approaches for analyzing qualitative data can be usefully conceptualized as research steps or stages, which move from the initial identification of themes to understanding their relationships, and from inductive exploration to deductive confirmation.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using","",Content Analysis;Coping;Data Analysis;Failure;Grounded Theory;Models;Qualitative Research;Resilience (Psychology);Responses;Social Science Research;Video Games;Statistics as Topic,,,1 not sharing/ not using,,Excluded,Excluded,1

These data sets may come from the traces that students leave when they interact, either individually or collaboratively, with learning management systems, interactive learning environments, intelligent tutoring systems, educational games or when they participate in a data-rich learning context. The types of data therefore range from raw log files to eyetracking devices and other sensor data. Being hosted in London, UK the theme of the conference is """"Big Data--Big Ben--Education Data Mining for Big Impact in Teaching and Learning"""". In this seventh year of EDM conferences, it is clear that the field is continuing to grow at a rapid pace. With renewed focus on education driven by big data learning analytics has put the EDM field in the center of growing interest. Traditional educational technologies, intelligent tutoring systems, educational games, and learning management systems all continue to generate growing amounts of data that are becoming available for analysis. The new interest in MOOCs and their promise to reach thousands or even hundreds of thousands of students per class requires techniques for feedback and grading that are being researched in the EDM domain.

It is estimated that 85\% of all UK secondary schools currently have CCTV systems in operation. The introduction of the Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA) (enacted in March 2000) meant that for the first time CCTV had direct legislation governing its use in the UK. This paper attempts to apply the decree to the widespread introduction of CCTV technology in schools and argues that the various elements of statute are impractical or inappropriate to educational institutions. The ill-defined and vague legislation presented in the DPA 1998 provides very little protection to the data subjects in schools (mainly pupils and teachers). In addition, the ubiquity of CCTV in schools in the UK far surpasses the enforcement capabilities and resources of the Information Commissioner's Office and as such any contravention of the scant provisions of the Act is likely to go unidentified and under-enforced. In consideration of the DPA, the paper elucidates numerous examples to suggest that a large number of schools are in contravention of the law. The paper outlines the need for bespoke policy to govern and regulate the use of CCTV in schools. Whilst the paper focuses on the case of the UK, it speaks to an international audience in concluding that the use of CCTV and surveillance technologies in schools requires greater scrutiny and regulation.

Meta analysis and research syntheses have increased with the increase in research using similar statistical analyses, refinements of analytical techniques, and the advent of computerized literature searches. No analogous definition of secondary data analysis from a qualitative point of view has been proposed, but the primary component would include analysis by a researcher removed from the process to continue the original analysis to address different questions or to use different methods to address the original research question. Discussion is just beginning about the possibilities of secondary  analysis of qualitative data. A typology of secondary analysis of qualitative data is proposed that includes secondary analysis, meta-analysis, and collaboration for qualitative inquiry. A classification of models for research synthesis for qualitative study can be conceived of as a series of cells that embody the time of the analysis, reanalysis, and the data set or sets. Because qualitative analysis is very time intensive, considerable savings might be realized with reanalysis of existing data sets. Issues involved in the accessibility of research, its validation, and the education of researchers are discussed, as are concerns about the limitations of reanalysis of qualitative studies.

The literature has suggested that fruitful data use is often the result of interactions among team members. However, up until now, most of the available research on data use has used """"collaboration"""" as an umbrella concept to describe very different types of interaction, without specifying the nature of collaboration or the degree of interdependency that takes place in interactions. Therefore, the current study investigates and describes Flemish teachers' individual, co-operative and collaborative data use. In doing so, the level of interdependency of teachers' interactive activities (storytelling, helping, sharing, joint work) is taken into account. The results of a qualitative study with semi-structured interviews show that teachers' data use is predominantly of an individual nature and that felt interdependencies among teachers are few.

These practices and policies often stagnate academic progress and have led to institutional deficits and the normalization of deficit-orientations towards students in predominantly Black schools. Accountability expectations set forth by federal legislation is just one example of how educational policy play a role in sustained deficit orientations toward Black schools through the utility of student performance information. State education agencies use student performance information from annual assessments to grade, categorize, and make decisions around support resources for students. This annual data snapshot also determine funding and shape the allocation of resources for schools despite their need to support students in non-academic ways. Currently, student performance information is constructed in a way that provide a singular view of student performance information based on proficiency leveling and categorical grouping of students. This grouping is centered on students' lack of skill and in turn automatically posits them in a place of deficit within the data. This view of data also shape the way school leaders draw on, make sense of and interact with data toward decision-making to improve educational outcomes. A new approach is needed to inform leadership decision making and support for alternative perspectives with data use to overcome institutional deficits and ineffective use of data in Black schools. The purpose of this study was to understand the sensemaking of data use through the stories told by school leaders in predominantly Black schools. This study used conceptual frames associated with sensemaking theory (Weick, 1995), school leader sensemaking theory (Gannon-Shilon \& Schechter, 2017) and data use theory (Coburn \& Turner, 2012) as guardrails to better understand elementary school leaders and their data use practices. Data use in school leadership is significant and can serve as a strategy to improve instructional practice. School leaders who have advanced data literacy skill sets can leverage student performance information (data) in ways that bring about insight (knowledge) to inform their leadership practice. School leaders are responsible for many aspects of the school operation and classroom instruction plays a major role toward improvement efforts. The improvement of instructional practice can lead to better educational outcomes for students in Black school communities. This study sought to capture the stories told by school leaders, specifically leaders in predominantly Black schools. This research study aimed to better understand how leaders accessed, interacted with, acted on and made sense of their data use practices toward the improvement of educational outcomes in their school. The main research question that guided this study was: (1) How do the stories of elementary school leaders serving in predominantly Black school communities explain how data is used to make decisions toward educational improvement? This study also sought to answer the following sub- questions: (1) What stories do elementary school leaders tell about how they use data to inform their leadership practice? (2) What contextual factors influence school leader interactions with data? In the analysis of the data, two different approaches helped to arrive at a broadened view of the data. In the first approach, leader stories were restoried and aligned to themes set forth by Clandinin and Connolly's (2000) three-dimensional narrative structure; interaction, continuity, and situation to view their experiences along a continuum. In the second approach, an open qualitative analysis was conducted and the leader stories were posited as data for interpretation. The findings brought forth a rich description of the leader's experience from two distinct analytical perspectives. The participant stories situated in the context of Black school communities provided a glimpse into the benefits and challenges leaders faced with data use towards educational improvement. Through these stories their voices are centered to offer insight into how data use practice can either help or hinder their improvement efforts. This knowledge is significant in that it can be transferable to other education spaces to inform policy at large and potentially re-story the public discourse around educational improvement in ethnically diverse school communities.

Despite the field's optimism on this matter, relatively few studies have attempted to quantify the effects of data use. These studies have often used the presence of a data use intervention (e.g., a data system or data coaching) as a proxy for use, as opposed to tracking teachers' direct interactions with data, via data system click logs, for example. Accordingly, the present study sought to address this methodological gap by exploring the 2-year effects of data use through a multilevel cross-classified model of teachers' system interactions and student achievement. A significant relationship was found between system use and elementary reading, but no significant relationships were found for elementary math, junior high math, or junior high reading.

However, students articulate an array of ideas about groundwater systems, including their natural and human elements. One way to support students' learning about groundwater systems is through the use of data-driven, computer-based modeling tools in technology-enabled science learning environments. To use models to reason productively about groundwater, students must be able to interpret the relationship between the model and the phenomena it represents. Here, we report findings from a study conducted in 7th-grade classrooms (n = 209) during implementation of a 3-week curriculum module designed around a data-driven, computer-based groundwater modeling tool -- the Hydrogeology Challenge. Students completed a series of tasks using the model to reason about and engage in problem-solving about a real-world, scenario-based water challenge. Here, we focus on how students relate -- or map -- elements of the model to the components of the authentic water-related phenomena they represent. We conducted quantitative and qualitative analyses of student artifacts and interviews. Findings suggest that students could more easily interpret and understand model elements which represent human dimensions of groundwater systems, such as wells, than they could elements that represent natural dimensions and processes, such as contour lines or groundwater flow direction. These findings provide important insights into students' model-based reasoning about groundwater and teaching and learning about coupled human-hydrological systems.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using","",Computer Assisted Instruction;Earth Science;Grade 7;Middle School Students;Models;Natural Resources;Science Process Skills;Secondary School Science;Topography;Water,,,1 not sharing/ not using,,Excluded,Excluded,1

A lack of research exists to explore how professional collaboration improves teaching and learning. This qualitative case study is an examination of teachers' perceptions of the value of professional collaborative time and the effectiveness of working together to integrate technology into their daily practice as part of a reform effort. The conceptual framework was Vygotsky's zone of proximal development, Gardner's multiple intelligences theory, and Senge's systems theory. Participants in the study were 6 high school teachers who had participated in data teams for 7 years. Data sources included 2 in-depth interviews with each participant and minutes for data team meetings. A combination of a priori and open coding was used to develop rich themes and patterns. Findings suggested that participants valued the professional collaboration they found in the data teams and were willing to follow a technology leader who mentored them as they adapted to new technologies. The teachers became dependent in using technology for lesson delivery and analyzing student data, but barriers prevented them from further technology integration or transitioning to student use of technology. Positive social change may occur as school leaders and district policy makers promote consistent time for teacher collaboration during the school day.

This paper describes our top-down approach for engineering features by means of psychometric modeling, aiming at machine learning for the predictive classification task. For feature engineering, we employed, among others, the Log-Normal Response Time Model for estimating latent person speed, and the Generalized Partial Credit Model for estimating latent person ability. Additionally, we adopted an """"n""""-gram feature approach for event sequences. Furthermore, instead of using the provided binary target label, we distinguished inefficient test takers who were going too fast and those who were going too slow for training a multi-label classifier. Our best-performing ensemble classifier comprised three sets of low-dimensional classifiers, dominated by test-taker speed. While our classifier reached moderate performance, relative to the competition leaderboard, our approach makes two important contributions. First, we show how classifiers that contain features engineered through literature-derived domain knowledge can provide meaningful predictions if results can be contextualized to test administrators who wish to intervene or take action. Second, our re-engineering of test scores enabled us to incorporate person ability into the models. However, ability was hardly predictive of efficient behavior, leading to the conclusion that the target label's validity needs to be questioned. Beyond competition-related findings, we furthermore report a state sequence analysis for demonstrating the viability of the employed tools. The latter yielded four different test-taking types that described distinctive differences between test takers, providing relevant implications for assessment practice.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using","",Classification;Competition;Data Analysis;Data Collection;Elementary School Students;Engineering Education;Item Response Theory;National Competency Tests;Prediction;Psychometrics;Response Style (Tests);Secondary School Students;Test Items;Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome,,,1 not sharing/ not using,,Excluded,Excluded,1

We believe that these small steps taken by reviewers will make a difference to create a more supportive environment for researchers to adopt more open science practices.","ERIC Number: EJ1392318 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Duplicate,1 not sharing/ not using","",Access to Information;Accountability;Authors;Educational Practices;Educational Research;Gifted Education;Information Dissemination;Journal Articles;Peer Evaluation;Science Education;Scientific Research;Writing for Publication,,,"Duplicate,1 not sharing/ not using",,Excluded,Excluded,1

There is currently less discussion on open science and its influence on learning and teaching in higher education, and reversely. This paper discusses open science in relation to educational practices and resources and reports on a study to investigate current educational practices from the perspective of open science. We argue that offering students opportunities via open educational practices raises their awareness of future open science goals and teaches them the skills needed to reach those goals. We present online survey results from 210 participants with teaching responsibility at higher education institutions in Germany. While some of them try to establish more open learning and teaching settings, most respondents apply rather traditional ways of learning and teaching. 60\% do not use open educational resources -- many have not even heard of them -- nor do they make their courses open for an online audience. Participants' priority lies in resource accuracy and quality and we still see a gap between the benefit of open practices and their practicability and applicability. The paper contributes to the general discussion of open practices in higher education by looking at open science practices and their adaptation to the learning and teaching environment. It formulates recommendations for improvements of open practice support and infrastructure.","ERIC Number: EJ1269837 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using","",College Faculty;Educational Objectives;Educational Practices;Educational Technology;Foreign Countries;Higher Education;Material Development;Media Selection;Open Education;Open Educational Resources;Researchers;Science Education;Teacher Attitudes;Germany,,,1 not sharing/ not using,,Excluded,Excluded,1

In this chapter, we propose that open-science reforms, which aim to make the research process as open and transparent as possible, can be applied to help address these issues.

And Womabat Security Technologies conducted a survey revealed that ransomware is an unknown concept to nearly two-thirds of employees. In practical, almost 95\% of cybersecurity attacks are due to human error. At fact, expensive and sophisticated systems cannot work effectively without considering the human factor, while human factor is the major vulnerability in cybersecurity. Thus, it has great significance to give people cybersecurity awareness training. In this paper, we present a system, named ASURA, providing adaptive training aimed at improving cybersecurity awareness of people. Three issues can't be neglected in adaptive cybersecurity awareness training, as follows. Firstly, we need to decide the proper training contents from the huge training materials. Secondly, the training contents should be timely updated, as cyber attacks constantly changing. At last, we should conduct training through effective and acceptable approach. We solved above three issues in this paper, and the innovative idea of this paper is constructing hierarchical concept map from the LOD database DBpedia. Then, we employ a series of processing on hierarchical concept map, including PageRank algorithm used to calculate the importance of each concept node, and filtering used to filtered out undefined and unrelated concepts. In particular, we get training contents from DBpedia dynamically and timely updated, so that training contents is keeping up to date. ASURA delivered training contents completely online, thus significant trimmed budget and allowed learners accessing training outside of a traditional classroom. Moreover, ASURA provide adaptive training targeted to individual learner, as it generate training contents based on the keyword from the learner.","ERIC Number: EJ1276136 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health,3 _not_human_observation_response_data","",Computer Assisted Instruction;Computer Security;Delivery Systems;Information Security;Instructional Materials;Training;Awareness,,,"5_adresses_government_health,3 _not_human_observation_response_data",,Excluded,Excluded,1

The pathway model aims to guide educators by structuring the design process of OD training activities and promotes design skills among teachers. The pathway model comprises five main steps: understand, review, design, teach and reflect.

With more and more applications such as students' performance prediction, course recommendation, dropout prediction and knowledge tracing relying upon machine learning models, there is increasing evidence and concerns about bias and unfairness of these models. Unfair models can lead to inequitable outcomes for some groups of students and negatively impact their learning. We show by real-world examples that educational data has embedded bias that leads to biased student modeling, which urges the development of fairness formalizations and fair algorithms for educational applications. Several formalizations of fairness have been proposed that can be classified into two types: (i) group fairness and (ii) individual fairness. Group fairness guarantees that groups are treated fairly as a whole, which might not be fair to some individuals. Thus individual fairness has been proposed to make sure fairness is achieved on individual level. In this work, we focus on developing an individually fair model for identifying students at-risk of underperforming. We propose a model which is based on the idea that the prediction for a student (identifying at-risk students) should not be influenced by his/her sensitive attributes. The proposed model is shown to effectively remove bias from these predictions and hence, making them useful in aiding all students.

New U.S. government requirements for exposing and managing federally funded research data add urgency to the call for curating data so that they can be used, re-used, and exploited by future generations. These new requirements have significant implications for cultural heritage institutions in addressing the current deficit in the capacity to support the re-use of data over time and across generations of technology (digital curation) and in enabling collaboration based on shared infrastructure. Cultural heritage encompasses various types of artifacts (analog or digital), as well as attributes and behaviors that groups or societies maintain over time to preserve connections to the past, present, and future. Cultural heritage institutions have a mission to support, perpetuate, and provide access to essential elements of culture as a whole. There are many different types of cultural heritage institutions, but three of the most commonly recognized are libraries, archives, and museums. Materials in their care are vital to the ongoing advancement and perpetuation of the sciences, social sciences, arts, and humanities. This report presents the implications for the cultural heritage community of the recent focus on creating public access to data and publications resulting from federal funding, and our recommendations for relevant stakeholders. The recommendations are based on a review of federal agencies' responses to new government requirements, case studies of seven digital curation projects, and an investigation of the current professional capacity for the long-term management of cultural heritage digital content, including data.

In this way, educators can facilitate students to understand how information is generated, processed, analysed and interpreted. This paper offers an initial exploration of ways in which the use of Open Data can be key in the development of transversal skills (including digital and data literacies, alongside skills for critical thinking, research, teamwork, and global citizenship), enhancing students' abilities to understand and select information sources, to work with, curate, analyse and interpret data, and to conduct and evaluate research.

By analyzing relationships between these works, this paper lays out design principles that can empower educators seeking to create equitable open learning experiences. Findings: This paper finds several generative intersections between the social justice centered epistemology presented by Medina, empirical learning design studies and OEP. This study finds that structured learning designs which integrate well-researched principles may provide guidance for further practice and research in ways not generally discussed in open education literature. This paper builds on these findings by describing practical ways these intersections can be implemented in OEP.

It aims to give special attention to the most recent approaches to publishing linguistic linked open data on the Web. Design/methodology/approach: Research papers published since 1990 on the use of various formats, standards, frameworks and methods to exchange linguistic information were divided into two main categories: those proposing specific schemas and syntaxes to suit the requirements of a given type of linguistic data (these are referred to as offline approaches), and those adopting the linked data (LD) initiative and the semantic web technologies to support the interoperability of heterogeneous linguistic resources. For each paper, the type of linguistic resource exchanged, the framework/format used, the interoperability approach taken and the related projects were identified. Findings: The information gathered in the survey reflects an increase in recent years in approaches adopting the LD initiative. This is due to the fact that the structural and syntactic issues which arise when addressing the interoperability of linguistic resources can be solved by applying semantic web technologies. What remains an open issue in the field of computational linguistics is the development of knowledge artefacts and mechanisms to support the alignment of the different aspects of linguistic resources in order to guarantee semantic and conceptual interoperability in the linked open data (LOD) cloud. Ontologies have proved to be of great use in achieving this goal. Research limitations/implications: The research presented here is by no means a comprehensive or all-inclusive survey of all existing approaches to the exchange of linguistic resources. Rather, the aim was to highlight, analyze and categorize the most significant advances in the field. Practical implications: This survey has practical implications for computational linguists and for every application requiring new developments in natural language processing. In addition, multilingual issues can be better addressed when semantic interoperability of heterogeneous linguistic resources is achieved. Originality/value: The paper provides a survey of past and present research and developments addressing the interoperability of linguistic resources, including those where the linked data initiative has been adopted.

The results are based on data collected through an online survey among 724 university educators. Depending on the actual use of OER and open teaching practices by the survey respondents, we have categorized them along a scale that goes from """"novice"""" to """"expert"""", and we analyzed the data to evaluate their use of OER and their adoption of open teaching practices, looking for relationships between the two phenomena. The main finding of this paper, which confirms the latest research findings from the open education community, is that a strong relationship exists between the two dimensions: The more an educator uses OER, the more he will probably adopt open teaching practices, and vice versa. These results are discussed with a view to use this virtuous circle between the use of open content and adoption of open teaching as a way to build generalized open education capacity among universities' teaching staff.","Volume: 11 ERIC Number: ED608874 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using","",College Faculty;Familiarity;Knowledge Level;Open Education;Open Educational Resources;Predictor Variables;Teaching Methods,,,1 not sharing/ not using,,Excluded,Excluded,1

This paper forms part of a larger study focusing on higher education educators' learning from and through their engagement with OER. The first part of the study was a quantitative survey investigating educators' learning behaviour when they learned to use OER in their practice. The second part of the study explored qualitatively how educators engaged with OER and how they conceptualised their learning. Data were gathered through interviews with 30 higher education educators. This paper reports the analysis of these interviews. The analysis draws on the theory of self-regulated learning and cultural-historical activity theory to explore the challenges adult education practitioners encounter when changing their practice. The study tests the application of a framework that traces the discursive manifestations of contradictions, exploring how this framework can be used to examine different aspects of self-regulated learning as educators learn how to use OER. We have identified three distinct tensions in higher education educators' practice: tensions between the emerging needs of the individual (as he or she adopts new forms of practice) and organisational policies; between the transfer of responsibilities from educators to students as new practice is embedded and institutional accountability; and between cost efficiency and learning objectives. The framework for the discursive manifestations of contradictions was a useful tool used to surface these apparent tensions.","ERIC Number: EJ1153240 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using","",Accountability;Adult Education;Barriers;Educational Policy;Efficiency;Higher Education;Independent Study;Interviews;Learning Theories;Open Education;Resource Units;Shared Resources and Services;Social Theories;Student Educational Objectives;Student Needs;Student Responsibility;Teacher Attitudes;Teacher Educators;Use Studies,,,1 not sharing/ not using,,Excluded,Excluded,1

Despite this, there is a paucity of research on OER use and impact, the extensiveness of OEP, and attitudes towards openness in India. This paper reports on research intended to help fill that knowledge gap by conducting a pan-India survey using many of the questions developed by the UK Open University's Open Education Research Hub (OERH) for use in its OER impact research around the world (http://oerresearchhub.org/collaborative-research/instruments/). Delivered online, in English and Hindi, the pan-India survey is the biggest of its kind to have been conducted in India. Analysis of the collected data reveals extensive evidence of educators using OER to improve their teaching, and survey respondents' common belief in the educational benefits of OER. In addition, despite encountering greater technical and structural barriers to OER use than those typically experienced by OERH survey respondents from the Global North, the pan-Indian survey respondents tend to show more engagement with OEP than their developed country peers, notably in terms of creating resources and publishing them on a Creative Commons (CC) license, and in adding comments to OER repositories. Accordingly, this paper presents an emergent model intended to better capture the rich contextual factors inhibiting and enabling OER use and OEP in the Global South. It must be acknowledged, however, that our findings relate to a fairly highly educated selection of educators, teacher-educators, students, education managers, academics, activists and policymakers. We therefore plan to expand on our model by conducting further research with a more diverse group of respondents, to include people facing technological, economic and societal barriers to using OER.","ERIC Number: EJ1101847 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using","",Activism;Administrator Attitudes;Barriers;College Faculty;Educational Improvement;Educational Resources;Foreign Countries;Online Surveys;Open Education;Student Attitudes;Teacher Attitudes;Teacher Educators;India,,,1 not sharing/ not using,,Excluded,Excluded,1

The aim was to determine the factors that might enable (conversely impede) the greater uptake of open educational resources (OER) in universities of this type. The research was informed by two theoretical frameworks. The first was derived from the literature on open educational practice and served as the basis for an interview schedule. The second was derived from the literature on RIUs and provided a structure for reflecting on the data in three areas of activity: pedagogy, outreach and governance. The researchers conducted semi-structured interviews with 14 academics, selected either for their involvement in open practices or for the recognition they had received for excellence in their teaching. The interview schedule was derived from a literature survey focusing on open pedagogic models. Topics discussed with interviewees included the """"flattening"""" of the teacher-student relationship, students' assumption of responsibility for their own learning, learning as (or in) a community and the possible influence of open practices in research on teaching. Findings suggest that open educational approaches can be accommodated in a university's prevailing pedagogic model without compromising its integrity. However, openness can enhance the specifics of that pedagogy; for example, through aligning research-informed teaching with emergent open practices in research and equipping students with the skills necessary for living and working in an open world. There is a closer alignment between releasing OER and an RIU's strategic mission for outreach. Nevertheless, the spread of open practices in both pedagogy and outreach hinges on issues of governance, which in RIUs is characterised by considerable emphasis on the autonomy of individual academics.","ERIC Number: EJ1099364 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using","",Alignment (Education);Educational Practices;Evidence Based Practice;Foreign Countries;Open Education;Outreach Programs;Research Universities;Resource Units;Semi Structured Interviews;Shared Resources and Services;Student Centered Learning;Student Responsibility;Teacher Student Relationship;Undergraduate Study,,,1 not sharing/ not using,,Excluded,Excluded,1

OER are understood to comprise content for teaching and learning, software-based tools and services, and licenses that allow for open development and re-use of content, tools and services. The OLCOS road mapping work was conducted to provide decision makers with an overview of current and likely future developments in OER and recommendations on how various challenges in OER could be addressed. While the results of the road mapping will provide some basis for policy and institutional planning, strategic leadership and decision making is needed for implementing measures that are likely to promote a further uptake of open educational practices and resources. OER are understood to be an important element of policies that want to leverage education and lifelong learning for the knowledge economy and society. However, OLCOS emphasises that it is crucial to also promote innovation and change in educational practices. In particular, OLCOS warns that delivering OER to the still dominant model of teacher-centred knowledge transfer will have little effect on equipping teachers, students and workers with the competences, knowledge and skills to participate successfully in the knowledge economy and society. This report emphasises the need to foster open practices of teaching and learning that are informed by a competency-based educational framework. However, it is understood that a shift towards such practices will only happen in the longer term in a step-by-step process. Bringing about this shift will require targeted and sustained efforts by educational leaders at all levels.

Secondary science students who successfully participate in authentic, novel, open inquiry studies must engage in problem finding to determine viable and suitable topics. This study examined problem finding strategies employed by students who successfully completed and presented the results of their open inquiry research at the 2007 Connecticut Science Fair and the 2007 International Science and Engineering Fair. A multicase qualitative study was framed through the lenses of creativity, inquiry strategies, and situated cognition learning theory. Data were triangulated by methods (interviews, document analysis, surveys) and sources (students, teachers, mentors, fair directors, documents). The data demonstrated that the quality of student projects was directly impacted by the quality of their problem finding. Effective problem finding was a result of students using resources from previous, specialized experiences. They had a positive self-concept and a temperament for both the creative and logical perspectives of science research. Successful problem finding was derived from an idiosyncratic, nonlinear, and flexible use and understanding of inquiry. Finally, problem finding was influenced and assisted by the community of practicing scientists, with whom the students had an exceptional ability to communicate effectively. As a result, there appears to be a juxtaposition of creative and logical/analytical thought for open inquiry that may not be present in other forms of inquiry. Instructional strategies are suggested for teachers of science research students to improve the quality of problem finding for their students and their subsequent research projects.

The study was conducted in a class of 39 primary 6 pupils of mixed ability who carried out four investigations. Data were based on pupils' responses on an attitude survey questionnaire, interviews, video tapes of pupils performing the investigations and field notes. The majority of the pupils liked conducting such investigations. Reasons for positive responses were that the pupils had the freedom to explore and devise their own procedures to find out things that they wanted to know about, they could work together and discuss with friends, the investigations were interesting and it was a valuable learning experience. Reasons for negative responses included the difficulty of coming up with good ideas to design the investigations, and group conflicts. The findings also indicate that group dynamics played an important role in influencing pupils' attitudes towards the investigations.","ERIC Number: EJ691668 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using,2 _not_qualitative/_video_data_","",Group Dynamics;Investigations;Learning Experience;Student Attitudes;Pupil,,,"1 not sharing/ not using,2 _not_qualitative/_video_data_",,Excluded,Excluded,1

Science students, in middle school grades 6-8 (917) and their 13 science teachers responded to surveys used to characterize science learning opportunities in the middle school classes. Ninth grade students (309) responded to a set of open-ended science questions that were developed from a standardized science test. The survey data provided a contextual framework for interpretation of ninth grade student performance on the open-ended science questions. The open-ended questions included questions for which students were required to graph and interpret data, write conclusions, identify control variables, and judge the validity of  information. These open-ended questions were scored by three raters according to a scoring rubric. Middle school students did report having science learning opportunities to practice science as inquiry, and their teachers reported that much of the science inquiry practice was contextual. At least 90\% of the ninth graders were from the same school district, but when practice in controlling data and making predictions was reported, student data from the open-ended questions suggested minimal transfer of these skills. The interpretation and use of graphic information and the actual graphing of data were areas that were problematic for ninth graders, as was the ability to provide reasons in support of answers. Recommendations based on this study include using a variety of contextual settings  for framing science inquiry practice and more attention on discussing, reading, and writing in the content area.

The contributed chapters in this book are organizes around these core processes of learning and teaching: subject matter representation; activation of learning and engagement of students with that subject matter content; encouragement of socialization and interaction between and among students; assessment of learning outcomes; and provision of feedback to students. The book consists of five parts. The four chapters in Part I articulate the key principles in the representation of subject matter content with the help of notable experiences with ICT. The four chapters  in Part II focus on creative uses of ICT in influencing learning by engaging students with the subject matter. In Part III, the four chapters focus on how ICT is used to integrate such processes as cooperative learning into educational practice and how these practices are influencing teachers' approaches to teaching and students' approaches to learning. The four chapters in Part IV examine how ICT affordances can be used to leverage approaches to the assessment of learning outcomes. In Part V, the three chapters focus on how certain fundamental principles of feedback can be leveraged with clever use of ICT. Includes an index.

The Board of Regents took the lead in coordinating the VEDS followup study among the 15 state-supported community colleges. A key feature of the followup study planning sessions was discussion about collecting useful information beyond the minimum required for the VEDS report. An open-book database approach was adopted instead of minimal compliance with federal regulations. An operational analysis of the outcomes from the process included the organizational planning and structure that evolved from the groundwork for this project, the project  products such as applications software, and operational difficulties encountered in implementing the project (content validity, confidentiality, and access). Data analyses were conducted at several different levels to produce reports for the federal government, state educational agencies, and the community colleges.

While the survey remains relatively consistent over the years, there are differences between cycles that pose a challenge to analyze the survey over time. Intervention A program package called cchsflow was developed to transform and harmonize CCHS variables to consistent formats across multiple survey cycles. An open science approach was used to maintain transparency, reproducibility and collaboration. Outcomes The cchsflow R package uses CCHS survey data between 2001 and 2014. Worksheets were created that identify variables, their names in previous cycles, their category structure, and their final variable names. These worksheets were then used to recode variables in each CCHS cycle into consistently named and labelled variables. Following, survey cycles can be combined. The package was then added as a GitHub repository to encourage collaboration with other researchers. Implication The cchsflow package has been added to the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) and contains support for over 160 CCHS variables, generating a combined data set of over 1 million respondents. By implementing open science practices, cchsflow aims to minimize the amount of time needed to clean and prepare data for the many CCHS users across Canada.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health",10.17269/s41997-020-00470-8     EA MAR 2021,Health Surveys,,,5_adresses_government_health,,Excluded,Excluded,1

Design/methodology/approach - Research papers published since 1990 on the use of various formats, standards, frameworks and methods to exchange linguistic information were divided into two main categories: those proposing specific schemas and syntaxes to suit the requirements of a given type of linguistic data (these are referred to as offline approaches), and those adopting the linked data (LD) initiative and the semantic web technologies to support the interoperability of heterogeneous linguistic resources. For each paper, the type of linguistic resource exchanged, the framework/format used, the interoperability approach taken and the related projects were identified.        Findings - The information gathered in the survey reflects an increase in recent years in approaches adopting the LD initiative. This is due to the fact that the structural and syntactic issues which arise when addressing the interoperability of linguistic resources can be solved by applying semantic web technologies. What remains an open issue in the field of computational linguistics is the development of knowledge artefacts and mechanisms to support the alignment of the different aspects of linguistic resources in order to guarantee semantic and conceptual interoperability in the linked open data (LOD) cloud. Ontologies have proved to be of great use in achieving this goal.        Research limitations/implications - The research presented here is by no means a comprehensive or all-inclusive survey of all existing approaches to the exchange of linguistic resources. Rather, the aim was to highlight, analyze and categorize the most significant advances in the field.        Practical implications - This survey has practical implications for computational linguists and for every application requiring new developments in natural language processing. In addition, multilingual issues can be better addressed when semantic interoperability of heterogeneous linguistic resources is achieved.        Originality/value - The paper provides a survey of past and present research and developments addressing the interoperability of linguistic resources, including those where the linked data initiative has been adopted.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health,3 _not_human_observation_response_data",10.1108/PROG-06-2012-0030,"",,,"5_adresses_government_health,3 _not_human_observation_response_data",,Excluded,Excluded,1

Although these practices have garnered interest in related fields, it remains unclear whether open science practices have been adopted in the field of communication sciences and disor-ders (CSD). This study aimed to survey the knowledge, implementation, and perceived benefits and barriers of open science practices in CSD. Method: An online survey was disseminated to researchers in the United States actively engaged in CSD research. Four-core open science practices were examined: preregistration, self-archiving, gold open access, and open data. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and regression models. Results: Two hundred twenty-two participants met the inclusion criteria. Most participants were doctoral students (38%) or assistant professors (24%) at R1 institutions (58%). Participants reported low knowledge of preregistration and gold open access. There was, however, a high level of desire to learn more for all practices. Implementation of open science practices was also low, most notably for preregistration, gold open access, and open data (< 25%). Predic-tors of knowledge and participation, as well as perceived barriers to implemen-tation, are discussed. Conclusion: Although participation in open science appears low in the field of CSD, participants expressed a strong desire to learn more in order to engage in these practices in the future.

The data were gathered by means of a survey which obtained 135 responses from researchers based in five research universities in Malaysia. The main conclusions are: (a) the researchers are aware of open data, yet, they are not practising it as shown in the mean scores, as well as in their responses towards the statements asked; (b) unclear information on data privacy policy, misuse of data, and the fear of losing publication opportunity are part of disincentives for data sharing. The requisite for open data understanding, practices and attitudinal change is needed for these may impact research practices, government policies and scientific knowledge, leading to research transparency and accountability, social benefit and economic growth. This paper concludes with a discussion that policies incentivizing the sharing and reuse of open data, as well as tools and guidance to support data sharing, and a strong incentives and rewards to implement open data among researchers, should be encouraged. Future studies should look into the importance of rewards for data sharing among researchers' institutions. Studies bridging the gap between policy and practices of open data should be examined, if true openness in research is to be established in Malaysia.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Included"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Included""""} | USER-NOTES: {""""Jürgen""""=>[""""qualitative data?""""]}",10.22452/mjlis.vol25no2.1,EARLY CAREER RESEARCHERS;DATA SHARING BEHAVIORS;MOTIVATIONS,,,,,Included,Included,1

The results suggest that so far, only very few institutions have adopted an open data / open content policy. There are however signs that many institutions may adopt this innovation in a near future: A majority of institutions considers open data as important and believes that the opportunities prevail over the risks. The main obstacles that need to be overcome are the institutions' reservations with regard to free licensing and their fear of losing control. With regard to crowdsourcing the data suggest that the diffusion process will be slower than for open data. Although approximately 10% of the responding institutions already seem to experiment with crowdsourcing, there is no general breakthrough in sight, as a majority of respondents remain skeptical with regard to the benefits. We argue that the observed difference in the dynamics of the diffusion of these innovations is primarily due to the fact that crowdsourcing is perceived by heritage institutions as more complex than open data, that it isn't readily expected to lead to any sizeable advantages, and that adopting crowdsourcing practices may require deeper cultural changes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 _not_qualitative/_video_data_,3 _not_human_observation_response_data",10.4067/S0718-18762014000300003,Switzerland,,,"2 _not_qualitative/_video_data_,3 _not_human_observation_response_data",,Excluded,Excluded,1

Three previous studies of the Canadian public's opinion about these topics have been conducted. Building on those results, an online survey representing the first study of public perceptions about biobanking spanning all Canadian provinces was conducted. Specifically, this study examined qualitative views about biobank objectives, governance structure, control and ownership of samples and data, benefit sharing, consent practices and data sharing norms, as well as additional questions and ethical concerns expressed by the public.        Results        Over half the respondents preferred to give a one-time general consent for the future sharing of their samples among researchers. Most expressed willingness for their data to be shared with the international scientific community rather than used by one or more Canadian institutions. Whereas more respondents indicated a preference for one-time general consent than any other model of consent, they constituted less than half of the total responses, revealing a lack of consensus among survey respondents regarding this question. Respondents identified biobank objectives, governance structure and accountability as the most important information to provide participants. Respondents' concerns about biobanking generally centred around the control and ownership of biological samples and data, especially with respect to potential misuse by insurers, the government and other third parties. Although almost half the respondents suggested that these should be managed by the researchers' institutions, results indicate that the public is interested in being well-informed about these projects and suggest the importance of increased involvement from participants. In conclusion, the study discusses the viability of several proposed models for informed consent, including e-governance, independent trustees and the use of exclusion clauses, in the context of these new findings about the views of the Canadian public.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using,3 _not_human_observation_response_data",10.1371/journal.pone.0129893,GENETIC RESEARCH;ETHICS;SOCIETY;TRENDS;MODEL,,,"1 not sharing/ not using,3 _not_human_observation_response_data",,Excluded,Excluded,1

Findings from three studies showed that open science practices such as preregistrations, material and data sharing, and open-access publishing are not commonly adopted in EM/D, likely because of concerns about possible risks to ethnoracial minority scholars and study populations. We offer practical recommendations to bridge these gaps and suggest future directions to connect EM/D and mainstream open science movement to better understand the experiences of ethnoracial minority communities and benefit the lives of the diverse human population.        Objectives: There are two potentially useful but nonintersecting efforts to help ensure that psychological science produces valid and credible information and contributes to the understanding of diverse human experiences. Whereas North American ethnic minority psychology research/cultural diversity science (EM/D) emphasizes cultural competency to yield contextualized psychological understanding of understudied and underserved minority populations, current open science (OS) approaches emphasize material and data sharing, and statistical proficiency to maximize the replicability of mainstream findings. To illuminate the extent of and explore reasons for this bifurcation, and OS's potential impact on EM/D, we conducted three studies. Method and Results: In Study 1, we reviewed editorial/publishing policies and empirical articles appearing in four major EM/D journals on the incentives for and use of OS. Journals varied in OS-related policies; 32 of 823 empirical articles incorporated any OS practices. Study 2 was a national mixed-methods survey of EM/D scholars' (N = 141) and journal editors' (N = 16) views about and experiences with OS practices. Emerged themes included beliefs about the impact of OS on scientific quality, possible professional disadvantages for EM/D scholars, and concerns about the welfare of and ethical risks posed for communities of color. In Study 3, we explored community research participants' beliefs about data sharing and credibility of science/scientists (N = 1,104). Participants were receptive of data sharing and viewed psychological science favorably. Conclusions: We provide data-driven recommendations for researchers to assemble the best tools for approaching the knowledge-production process with transparency, humility, and cultural competency.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: screening full text | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health,4_not_prerequisites_barriers_facilitators_",10.1037/cdp0000541     EA APR 2022,PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH;CLINICAL-PSYCHOLOGY;REGISTRATION;ATTITUDES;AMERICAN;THOUGHTS;JOURNALS;WHITE;GUIDE;BIAS,,,"5_adresses_government_health,4_not_prerequisites_barriers_facilitators_",screening full text,Excluded,Excluded,1

Drawing on a survey data of 698 Japanese natural scientists, this study analyzes the behaviors and norms of university scientists under the influence of university interventions for entrepreneurship, whereby examining the compatibility between entrepreneurship and open science. The results indicate that entrepreneurial interventions have facilitated scientists' norm for practical contribution, and consequently, their involvement in commercial activities and ties with industry. Then, some, but not all, of these entrepreneurial activities have deterred cooperative or open relationships between scientists. However, the results suggest that the entrepreneurial interventions have not deteriorated the traditional norm for open science.

Over the past decade, there has been increasing pressure on university researchers to commercialize their work. Concurrently, they are encouraged to collaborate, share data and disseminate new knowledge quickly (that is, to adopt an open science model) in order to foster scientific progress, meet humanitarian goals, and to maximize the impact of their research.        Discussion: We present selected guidelines from three countries (Canada, United States, and United Kingdom) situated at the forefront of genomics to illustrate this potential policy conflict. Examining the innovation ecosystem and the messages conveyed by the different policies surveyed, we further investigate the inconsistencies between open science and commercialization policies.        Summary: Commercialization and open science are not necessarily irreconcilable and could instead be envisioned as complementary elements of a more holistic innovation framework. Given the exploratory nature of our study, we wish to point out the need to gather additional evidence on the coexistence of open science and commercialization policies and on its impact, both positive and negative, on genomics academic research.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 _not_qualitative/_video_data_,4_not_prerequisites_barriers_facilitators_",10.1186/gm316,ACADEMIC RESEARCH;IMPACT;UK,,,"2 _not_qualitative/_video_data_,4_not_prerequisites_barriers_facilitators_",,Excluded,Excluded,1

This funding allows academic researchers to assess gambling-related problems in populations, evaluate tools designed to encourage responsible gambling behaviors, and develop evidence-based recommendations for gambling-related topics. Some stakeholders have raised concern about industry-funded research. These critics argue that industry funding might influence the research process. Such concerns have led to the development of research guidelines that aim to preserve academic independence. Concurrently and independently, researchers have begun to embrace 'Open Science' practices (e.g. pre-registration of research questions and hypotheses, open access to materials and data) to foster transparency and create a valid, reliable, and replicable scientific literature. We suggest that Open Science principles and practices can be integrated with existing guidelines for industry-funded research to ensure that the research process is ethical, transparent, and unbiased. In the current paper, we engage with the aforementioned issues and present a formal framework to guide industry-funded research. We outlineGuidelines forResearchIndependence andTransparency (GRIT), which integrates Open Science practices with existing guidelines for industry-funded research. Specifically, we describe how particular Open Science practices can enhance industry-funded research, including research pre-registration, separation of confirmatory and exploratory analyses, open materials, open data availability, and open access to study manuscripts. We offer our guidelines in the context of industry-funded gambling studies, yet researchers can extend these ideas to the behavioral sciences, more generally, and to funding sources of any type.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 _not_qualitative/_video_data_,4_not_prerequisites_barriers_facilitators_",10.1080/16066359.2020.1767774     EA MAY 2020,ASSOCIATION;EDUCATION;OUTCOMES;ALCOHOL;TOBACCO,,,"2 _not_qualitative/_video_data_,4_not_prerequisites_barriers_facilitators_",,Excluded,Excluded,1

Researchers and institutions have proposed open science practices (OSPs) to improve the detectability of QRPs and the credibility of science. We examine the prevalence of QRPs and OSPs in criminology, and researchers' opinions of those practices. Methods We administered an anonymous survey to authors of articles published in criminology journals. Respondents self-reported their own use of 10 QRPs and 5 OSPs. They also estimated the prevalence of use by others, and reported their attitudes toward the practices. Results QRPs and OSPs are both common in quantitative criminology, about as common as they are in other fields. Criminologists who responded to our survey support using QRPs in some circumstances, but are even more supportive of using OSPs. We did not detect a significant relationship between methodological training and either QRP or OSP use. Support for QRPs is negatively and significantly associated with support for OSPs. Perceived prevalence estimates for some practices resembled a uniform distribution, suggesting criminologists have little knowledge of the proportion of researchers that engage in certain questionable practices. Conclusions Most quantitative criminologists in our sample have used QRPs, and many have used multiple QRPs. Moreover, there was substantial support for QRPs, raising questions about the validity and reproducibility of published criminological research. We found promising levels of OSP use, albeit at levels lagging what researchers endorse. The findings thus suggest that additional reforms are needed to decrease QRP use and increase the use of OSPs.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using,2 _not_qualitative/_video_data_",10.1007/s10940-021-09525-6     EA AUG 2021,PUBLICATION BIAS;REPLICATION;CRIME;REPLICABILITY;METAANALYSIS;REVOLUTION;OUTCOMES,,,"1 not sharing/ not using,2 _not_qualitative/_video_data_",,Excluded,Excluded,1

The first two dimensions of the MFA were named willingness to share and satisfaction with resources based on the contributing questions and answers. Our results indicated that both dimensions are strongly influenced by individual factors such as perceived benefit, risk, and effort. Satisfaction with resources was significantly influenced by social and organizational factors such as the availability of training and data repositories. Researchers that improved in willingness to share are shown to be operating in domains with a high reliance on shared resources, are reliant on funding from national or federal sources, work in sectors where internal practices are mandated, and live in regions with highly effective communication networks. Significantly, satisfaction with resources was inversely correlated with willingness to share across all regions.

In particular, it examines the extent to which participation in commercial activity is associated with publication secrecy. The results show that patenting rates are higher in Japan, while industry funding is more common in the US. In addition, the overall level of publication secrecy is greater in Japan. And, in both countries, individuals who are commercially active are less likely to share their research results through publication. But, patents are less directly linked to commercial activity in Japan than in the US, and have less impact on academic secrecy.

During the last five years, this metric has been cited and used by some other authors but the extensive use of the metric has brought to light some of its limitations.

We conduct an econometric analysis with firm-level data from the fourth edition of the French innovation survey (CIS) and matched scientific publications for a sample of 2512 R&D performing firms from all manufacturing sectors. This analysis provides evidence that firms are more likely to adopt academic principles if they need to access scientific knowledge that is considered important for their innovation development, whereas the mere existence of collaborative links with academic institutions is not a strong determinant.

The aim of this study was to examine chiropractic patients' beliefs, experiences and satisfaction with chiropractic care in an open environment and to test the hypothesis that a patient's privacy and dignity may be preserved in open adjusting environments.        Methods: A convenience sample of twenty-seven European chiropractors from 8 European countries was obtained through 2 national association e-mail lists and verbal request at 2 continuing education seminars. They and their patients were asked to complete a Global Wellness and Likert-type survey for the purpose of this study.        Results: One thousand, one hundred and nine patients who received chiropractic care in an open environment participated in this study. They reported to be very highly satisfied with the care they were receiving (average rating = 8.98/10) and expressed significantly improved survey responses in regard to their self-rated Global Wellness at the time of evaluation compared to baseline measures. In terms of their attitudes, beliefs and experiences in this model of chiropractic care, participants indicated positive experiences in that they were comfortable receiving care in such an environment, their dignity was respected, their privacy maintained and they were cared for in a professional manner.        Conclusions: The findings presented here provide valuable insight into patients' perspectives in receiving care in an open adjusting environment. Our results demonstrate that the open adjusting environment is an effective practice model for maintaining a patient's dignity and privacy while providing a high level of patient satisfaction. Open room care may need to be included in future decisions regarding best practice configuration for chiropractic care facilities. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

Based on survey results, interviews, and complementary evidence from secondary sources, we explore the motives and beliefs about open data investment expressed by open data experts in both public and private organizations. To our surprise, in both public and private organizations we find that open data investments are driven more by legitimacy-seeking than a quest to realize the value creation potential of open data. The results are worrisome, as such motives and beliefs do not necessarily lead to investment in the complementary assets needed to realize the potential associated with open data-instead, open data risks becoming a lost opportunity. Clearly, it's time to move beyond the open data hype and get down to business.

This research used a survey method to examine to what extent those attitudinal, normative, resource factors influence psychologists' behavioral intentions to adopt an open data badge, and therefore engage in data sharing behaviors. A national survey (n= 341) across the field of psychology showed that perceived benefit and perceived risk had significant positive and negative relationships with attitude toward the open data badge respectively. Furthermore, attitude toward open data badge and norm of data sharing had significant positive influences on psychologists' behavioral intentions to adopt the open data badge. Perceived effort had a significant negative relationship with the behavioral intention to adopt the open data badge, but had no effect toward attitudes surrounding the badge. However, this research found that the availability of a data repository and pressure from an open science journal did not have any significant relationship with behavioral intention to adopt the open data badge.

Analysis of survey responses indicates that researchers have difficulties in coping with OS policy and that they feel policy alienation from OS policy. Hence, researchers may be less willing to try to support OS policy implementation despite the fact that OS policies are motivated by the desire to enhance the excellence and quality of research. The findings address how the incentive problems lie not only in the research evaluation and academic credit systems but also in the policy-practice divide.

Design/methodology/approach - This is a case study research, which itself is based on a combinative approach, especially in applying, in a successive order, two methods of investigation, namely, stakeholder and policy analysis. In general, the combination of these two research techniques is useful in understanding the most important collaborative trends in the area and locating key institutional drivers and challenges that open data policymakers face today in implementing related digital collaborative and participatory platforms.        Findings - The open data concept could provide a promising collaborative platform to network various e-government stakeholders and accelerate related technology-driven public reforms. The successful implementation of the idea demands a fairly equal contribution from representatives of both public and private sectors of economy. The case has also clearly demonstrated the importance of cooperation with the local non-governmental sector, independent developers and journalists, whose active participation is a key factor for the overall progress of the open data phenomenon, to a greater degree, as a collaborative movement rather than an instrument of public sector innovations.        Research limitations/implications - One of the fundamental limitations of the investigation is that it is a single case study. It explores the development of open data phenomena in the context of such an advanced post-industrial society as Finland. In this regard, in order to support key arguments of the research, it is necessary to compare its findings with the results of similar case studies in other administrative, political and socioeconomic settings, which would open new promising dimensions for future research in this direction.        Practical implications - Policy recommendations are proposed by the author in the discussion section, which could help, for example, to boost information campaigns in popularizing open data technologies and its reuse among independent developers. A lot of unique visualizations and illustrations are presented in the paper to help readers grasp better key ideas of the research. In this respect, the paper is intended for a global professional community of open data experts, e-government specialists, political scientists, journalists, lawyers, students of public policy and public administration and all those who are interested in studying the phenomenon from the perspective of its key stakeholders.        Social implications - The author of the paper tried to develop a universal framework of case study research that could be used in investigating phenomena of open data not only in Finland but also in the context of other post-industrial societies, especially in analyzing roles of various stakeholders in adopting open data-driven collaborative and civic engagement platforms and startups.        Originality/value - This research presents a first case study that investigates a collaborative potential of open data phenomena from a stakeholder perspective in a more holistic manner, especially in analyzing professional networking platforms and related communication activities that meet the interests of stakeholders as diverse as government agents and journalists, independent developers and academia, charities and businesses in an attempt to better understand the fundamental factors of the open data movement as a collaborative socioeconomic trend.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health",10.1108/AJIM-11-2017-0250,OPEN GOVERNMENT DATA;MODELS,,,5_adresses_government_health,,Excluded,Excluded,1

The two benchmarking models use datasets containing building characteristics and annual energy use from ten major cities. To examine the difference in performance between linear and non-linear models, we use random forest and lasso regression. Results demonstrate that benchmarking models using open data outperform models based solely on the CBECS dataset. Additionally, our results indicate that building area, property type, conditioned area, and water usage are the most important variables for cities to collect.

The deployment of such systems in the hotel industry needs to satisfy specific constraints making the direct application of classical approaches insufficient. Travelers recurrently fall into the cold-start status due to the volatility of interest and the change in attitudes depending on the context. Events have been playing an essential role in drawing attention to specific regions and constitute a major motive to organize trips. In this paper, we explore for the first time the benefits of introducing open data related to events into hotel recommender systems. We address in particular two problems, the hotel-centric and the event-centric problems, where we recommend pairs of hotels and events in order to facilitate the tourism planning and enhance the travelers' experience. We first collect data related to events and filter those susceptible of attracting people. We then develop a novel framework that infers events' affinities based on hotel booking data and rely on the mass behavior to make personalized suggestions. Finally, we demonstrate our framework by performing a qualitative and a quantitative evaluation. Improvements in the quality of recommendation show the advantage of leveraging event data for hotel recommendation and illustrate the opportunities of using open data for tourism planning.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 _not_human_observation_response_data",10.1007/s40558-018-0119-6,WORD-OF-MOUTH;INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY;TOURISM;PROGRESS;SYSTEMS;TRUST;STATE,,,3 _not_human_observation_response_data,,Excluded,Excluded,1

First, to provide the reader with an overview of the open datasets available and ready to be used in order to foster reproducible research in the field. Second, to review electric vehicle charging load models with their strengths and weaknesses. Third, to provide suggestions on matching the models reviewed to six datasets found in this research that have not previously been explored in the literature. The open data search covered more than 860 repositories and yielded around 60 datasets that are relevant for modelling electric vehicle charging load. These datasets include information on charging point locations, historical and real-time charging sessions, traffic counts, travel surveys and registered vehicles.

This rhetoric dictates that government content should be freely accessible, repurposable, machine-readable, standardized across subregions, and available without licensing restrictions. Canada offers an excellent example of renewed emphasis on openness across jurisdictions. The call for legislative openness also derives from open data advocates, who seek to apply the rules of open data to unstructured information. We do not know whether legislative openness in Canada, at the provincial and territorial level, matches the rhetoric of open data. This study focused on commonly occurring categories of information on subnational legislative websites, and examined their copyright, availability, archivability, information timeliness, and plain language descriptions. Legislatures were contacted about current practices in the form of a web survey with follow-up phone interviews. We collected additional information via a web content analysis. Results indicated that a considerable amount of information was available, although generally at minimal levels of compliance and with significant variance across legislatures. Respondents expressed confusion about the extent of actual versus perceived openness of their information. We hope these findings provoke a subnational dialogue on legislative openness across Canada.

Methods: We performed a scoping review guided by Arksey and O'Malley's framework and Joanna Briggs' Manual for Scoping Reviews. Our search methods consisted of searching five bibliographic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LISTA, and Web of Science Core Collection), reference harvesting, and targeted website and journal searching. To determine study eligibility, we applied predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria and reached consensus when there was disagreement. We extracted data in duplicate and performed qualitative analysis to map key themes. Results: We included fifty-four studies. Research methods included descriptive or narrative approaches (76%); surveys, questionnaires, and interviews (15%); or mixed methods (9%). We labeled studies with one or more of FOSTER's six OS themes: open access (54%), open data (43%), open science (24%), open education (6%), open source (6%), and citizen science (6%). Key drivers in OS were scientific integrity and transparency, openness as a guiding principle in research, and funder mandates making research publicly accessible. Conclusions: HSLs play key roles in advancing OS worldwide. Formal studies are needed to assess the impact of HSLs' engagement in OS. HSLs should promote adoption of OS within their research communities and develop strategic plans aligned with institutional partners. HSLs can promote OS by adopting more rigorous and transparent research practices of their own. Future research should examine HSLs' engagement in OS through social justice and equity perspectives.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health",10.5195/jmla.2021.1256,PUBLIC-ACCESS POLICY;MEDICAL-LIBRARY;SERVICES;PERSPECTIVE;SUPPORT,,,5_adresses_government_health,,Excluded,Excluded,1

Design/methodology/approach - The study is based on 12 in-depth interviews with principal investigators, project managers and developers involved in UK e-Science projects, together with supporting documentary evidence from project web sites. The approach was to explore the juxtaposition of research governance at the institutional level and local research practices at the project level. Interview questions focused on research inputs, software development processes, access to resources, project documentation, dissemination of outputs and by-products, licensing issues, and institutional contracts.        Findings - The findings suggest that, although there is a widely shared ethos of openness in everyday research practice, there are many uncertainties and yet-to-be resolved issues, despite strong policy imperatives towards openly shared resources.        Research limitations/implications - The paper concludes by observing a stratification of openness in practice and the need for more nuanced understanding of openness at the level of policy making. This research was based on interviews within a limited number of e-Science/Social Science projects and the intention is to address this in future work by scaling the study up to a survey that will reach the entire UK e-Science/Social Science community.        Practical implications - The fundamental challenge in resolving openness in practice and policy, land thereby moving towards a sustainable infrastructure for e-Science, is the coordination and integration of goals across e-Science efforts, rather than one of resolving IPR (Intellectual Property Rights) issues, which has been the central focus of openness debates thus far.        Originality/value-The question of openness has previously been posed on the macro-level of research policy, e.g. whether science as a whole can be characterized as open science, or in relation to the dissemination of published outputs, e.g. Open Access. Instead, a fine-grained perspective is taken focusing on individual research projects and the various facets of openness in practice.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 _not_human_observation_response_data",10.1108/00220410910926103,INNOVATION;ISSUES,,,3 _not_human_observation_response_data,,Excluded,Excluded,1

Method. This study captures heuristics used by natural scientists to inform their discovery and reuse. Using a critical incident technique, forty-three scientists from biology, geology, and oceanography were asked to describe their most recent data discovery resulting in reuse.        Analysis. To frame participants' behaviour along a sequence of actions from finding to reusing data, the survey used the FAIR Data Principles.        Results. Results show a common lack of understanding of controlled vocabulary and a common determination of fitness of use by noting familiar sources rather than searching through extensive metadata.

As journals can act as gatekeepers for scientific discoveries, a potential tendency not to mention OSPs on their websites may help to explain this implementation gap. Therefore, we examined the implementation of OSPs and potential barriers in industrial and organizational psychology and management (IOP/management) journals. Study 1 examined whether and how N = 257 journal websites referred to OSPs. We found that most journals did not mention OSPs. Specifically, only two (1.0%), five (2.5%), and 14 (6.9%) IOP/management journals mentioned preregistration, registered reports, and explicitly welcomed replications, respectively. Study 2 investigated perceived barriers to implementing OSPs with a survey among editors of the IOP/management journals from Study 1. Among the 40 responding editors, 14, 10, and five attributed the lacking implementation of OSPs to a lesser suitability of OSPs for qualitative research, missing authority, and missing familiarity with OSPs, respectively. Based on our findings, the implementation gap could be mitigated by developing new and refining extant OSPs, starting bottom-up initiatives (e.g., researchers directly contacting publishers), and increasing the availability of information on OSPs.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health,4_not_prerequisites_barriers_facilitators_ | USER-NOTES: {""""Jürgen""""=>[""""includes open data?""""]}",10.1080/1359432X.2023.2206571     EA MAY 2023,QUESTIONABLE RESEARCH PRACTICES;STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT;REPLICATION;CRISIS;PREREGISTRATION;REPRODUCIBILITY;REPLICABILITY;DETERMINANTS;INCENTIVES;SECTION;Self Psychology,,,"5_adresses_government_health,4_not_prerequisites_barriers_facilitators_ |",,Excluded,Excluded,1

We aimed to explore open data ecosystems involving commercial actors. Thus, we organized five focus groups with 27 practitioners from 22 companies, public organizations, and research institutes. Based on the outcomes, we surveyed three cases of emerging ODE practice to further understand the concepts and to validate the initial findings. The main outcome is an initial conceptual model of ODEs' value, intrinsics, governance, and evolution, and propositions for practice and further research.        We found that ODE must be value driven. Regarding the intrinsics of data, we found their type, meta-data, and legal frameworks influential for their openness.

The LOD approach achieves this through the provision of services for describing, indexing, organizing, and retrieving knowledge artifacts and making them available for quick consumption and publication. This is also aligned with the role and objective of traditional library cataloging. Owing to this link, major libraries of the world are transferring their bibliographic metadata to the LOD landscape. Some developments in this direction include the replacement of Anglo-American Cataloging Rules 2nd Edition by the Resource Description and Access (RDA) and the trend towards the wider adoption of BIBFRAME 2.0. An interesting and related development in this respect are the discussions among knowledge resources managers and library community on the possibility of enriching bibliographic metadata with socially curated or user-generated content. The popularity of Linked Open Data and its benefit to librarians and knowledge management professionals warrant a comprehensive survey of the subject. Although several reviews and survey articles on the application of Linked Data principles to cataloging have appeared in literature, a generic yet holistic review of the current state of Linked and Open Data in cataloging is missing. To fill the gap, the authors have collected recent literature (2014-18) on the current state of Linked Open Data in cataloging to identify research trends, challenges, and opportunities in this area and, in addition, to understand the potential of socially curated metadata in cataloging mainly in the realm of the Web of Data. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this review article is the first of its kind that holistically treats the subject of cataloging in the Linked and Open Data environment. Some of the findings of the review are: Linked and Open Data is becoming the mainstream trend in library cataloging especially in the major libraries and research projects of the world; with the emergence of Linked Open Vocabularies (LOV), the bibliographic metadata is becoming more meaningful and reusable; and, finally, enriching bibliographic metadata with user-generated content is gaining momentum. Conclusions drawn from the study include the need for a focus on the quality of catalogued knowledge and the reduction of the barriers to the publication and consumption of such knowledge, and the attention on the part of library community to the learning from the successful adoption of LOD in other application domains and contributing collaboratively to the global scale activity of cataloging.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health,2 _not_qualitative/_video_data_",10.6017/ital.v37i4.10432,LIBRARY METADATA;BIBFRAME 2.0;QUALITY;FUTURE;CLASSIFICATION;REQUIREMENTS;SERVICES;LINKING;WEB,,,"5_adresses_government_health,2 _not_qualitative/_video_data_",,Excluded,Excluded,1

While there are extensive studies on the prevalence of QRPs among scientists, little is known about their occurrence among students. This article presents the first large-scale survey among 1,397 psychology students in the German-speaking countries to investigate the occurrence of QRPs in student projects and the current state of academic teaching regarding the replication crisis and open science. The joint examination of teaching and the use of questionable research practices serves to provide information on how the teaching of psychology is related to the empirical approach of students. The results reveal that questionable research practices do occur in student projects, albeit with large differences in the occurrence of specific QRPs. We also found differences in the incidence of QRPs between different project types: QRP usage was most frequent in empirical internships and least frequent in master's theses. Our data suggest that the extent of reported QRPs generally decreases as students progress in their study programs. In addition, most students seem to have already come into contact with the replication crisis in teaching, mostly in methodology classes. Finally, we provide impulses for the further development of the teaching of psychology. The principles of openness, transparency, and collaboration play an important role in these recommendations, which are aimed at teaching and producing robust research from the very beginning.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 _not_qualitative/_video_data_,4_not_prerequisites_barriers_facilitators_",10.1026/0033-3042/a000562,INCENTIVES,,,"2 _not_qualitative/_video_data_,4_not_prerequisites_barriers_facilitators_",,Excluded,Excluded,1

Results and data were obtained by a combined method of online interviews and an online questionnaire.

Based on these results, there is a trend in favour of open access, but the perceived barriers to open peer review outweighed the advantages.

There is ample evidence that QRPs are corrosive because they make research opaque and therefore challenge the credibility, trustworthiness, and usefulness of the scientific knowledge that is produced. A literature based on false-positive results that will not replicate is not only scientifically misleading but also worthless for anyone who wants to put knowledge to use. So, a question then arises: Why are these QRPs still so pervasive and why do gatekeepers of scientific knowledge such as journal editors, reviewers, funding-agency panel members, and board members of professional organizations in charge of journal policies not seem to be taking decisive actions about QRPs? We address these questions by using a science-practice gap analogy to identify the existence of a science-practice gap in open science. Specifically, although there is abundant research on how to reduce QRPs, many gatekeepers are not adopting this knowledge in their practices. Drawing upon the literatures on the more general science-practice gap and QRPs, we offer 10 actionable recommendations for narrowing the specific science-practice gap in open science. Our recommendations require little effort, time, and financial resources. Importantly, they are explicit about the resulting benefits for the various research-production stakeholders (i.e., authors and gatekeepers). By translating findings on open-science research into actionable recommendations for """"practitioners of research"""", we hope to encourage more transparent, credible, and reproducible research that can be trusted and used by consumers of that research.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 4_not_prerequisites_barriers_facilitators_",10.1016/j.obhdp.2020.02.007,QUESTIONABLE RESEARCH PRACTICES;REGISTERED-REPORTS;ORGANIZATIONAL-PSYCHOLOGY;SCHOLARLY IMPACT;PUBLICATION BIAS;MANAGEMENT;CREDIBILITY;INCENTIVES;INDUSTRIAL;AUTHORS,,,4_not_prerequisites_barriers_facilitators_,,Excluded,Excluded,1

In practical, almost 95% of cybersecurity attacks are due to human error. At fact, expensive and sophisticated systems cannot work effectively without considering the human factor, while human factor is the major vulnerability in cybersecurity. Thus, it has great significance to give people cybersecurity awareness training. In this paper, we present a system, named ASURA, providing adaptive training aimed at improving cybersecurity awareness of people. Three issues can't be neglected in adaptive cybersecurity awareness training, as follows. Firstly, we need to decide the proper training contents from the huge training materials. Secondly, the training contents should be timely updated, as cyber attacks constantly changing. At last, we should conduct training through effective and acceptable approach. We solved above three issues in this paper, and the innovative idea of this paper is constructing hierarchical concept map from the LOD database DBpedia. Then, we employ a series of processing on hierarchical concept map, including PageRank algorithm used to calculate the importance of each concept node, and filtering used to filtered out undefined and unrelated concepts. In particular, we get training contents from DBpedia dynamically and timely updated, so that training contents is keeping up to date. ASURA delivered training contents completely online, thus significant trimmed budget and allowed learners accessing training outside of a traditional classroom. Moreover, ASURA provide adaptive training targeted to individual learner, as it generate training contents based on the keyword from the learner.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health,3 _not_human_observation_response_data",10.1007/s10639-020-10155-x     EA MAY 2020,DBPEDIA;WEB;Awareness,,,"5_adresses_government_health,3 _not_human_observation_response_data",,Excluded,Excluded,1

However, data release faces barriers due to limited support of civil servants, whereas the literature neglects civil servants' role in opening data. This paper aims at understanding why civil servants can be reluctant to support the disclosure of data. The authors developed a model to explain civil servants' behavioral intention to open data.Design/methodology/approachThe authors test a series of hypotheses by collecting and analyzing survey data from 387 civil servants and by applying multivariate hierarchical regression.FindingsThe results indicate the factors influencing the behavior of civil servants. Social influences, performance expectancy, data management knowledge and risks have a significant influence. Personal characteristics control these effects.Research limitations/implicationsCaution is needed to generalize the findings towards the support to open data provision by civil servants. Though the analyzed sample was limited to Brazil, other countries and cultures might yield different outcomes. Larger and more diversified samples might indicate significant effects on variables not found in this research.Practical implicationsThe insights can be used to develop policies for increasing the support of civil servants towards governmental data disclosure.Originality/valueThis study suggests factors of influence to civil servants' behavior intentions to disclose governmental data.

The estimated sharing rate was not far from totality (97.6% +/- 2.1%) and substantially higher than observed in other fields of genetic research (evolutionary, medical and forensic genetics). Both a questionnaire-based survey and the examination of Journals' editorial policies suggest that this high sharing rate cannot be simply explained by the need to comply with stakeholders requests. Most data were made available through body text, but the use of primary databases increased in coincidence with the introduction of complete mitochondrial and next-generation sequencing methods. Our study highlights three important aspects. First, our results imply that researchers' awareness of the importance of openness and transparency for scientific progress may complement stakeholders' policies in achieving very high sharing rates. Second, widespread data sharing does not necessarily coincide with a prevalent use of practices which maximize data findability, accessibility, useability and preservation. A detailed look at the different ways in which data are released can be very useful to detect failures to adopt the best sharing modalities and understand how to correct them. Third and finally, the case of human paleogenetics tells us that a widespread awareness of the importance of Open Science may be important to build reliable scientific practices even in the presence of complex experimental challenges.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health",10.1371/journal.pone.0121409,ANCIENT;SOCIETY;AVAILABILITY;GENETICS;FUTURE;DNA;Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Information Dissemination;Movement,,,5_adresses_government_health,,Excluded,Excluded,1

A better understanding by citizens of what a government does and the level of performance achieved can be better understood by making public sector data open. Citizens can therefore hold their government accountable for not meeting up with stated goals and misconducts. This study employs a survey through content analysis to evaluate the extent of implementation of open data portals. Variables used for the evaluation are Berners-Lee 5 star of open data, implementation technology, data formats, licensing, major data sets and functionality across the African continent. A total of twenty-two data portals from seventeen different countries were assessed. Seven of the data portals representing 32% of the total number of the data portals were implemented using Drupal tool (Dkan). About 60% of the portals under investigation are national initiatives, and Nigeria has the only regional/state initiative and the only two independent organisation data portals. The only two university related-initiatives as well as the only city-based data portal were from South Africa, while a specialised data portal dedicated to the Ebola crisis was captured from Sierra Leone. The dates for the creation of the data portals span from 2011 to the current year (2015). The result indicates that an appreciable effort is being made in the creation of data portals; however, more countries need to take the giant stride to data provisioning in the open formats. More data sets also need to be populated onto the portals. Movement towards attaining the 5 star status of open data portals is in progress but a lot needs to be done towards attaining this. There is also a need to complement the efforts of national governments, and this could be done by regional/state, cities, universities, and independent organisations.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health","","",,,5_adresses_government_health,,Excluded,Excluded,1

In this context, the achievement of a robust, effective and responsible form of data sharing is now widely acknowledged as a fundamental part of the research process. The production and resolution of human genomic data has steadily increased in recent years, mainly due to technological advances and decreasing costs of DNA genotyping and sequencing. There is, however, a downside to this process due to the huge increase in the complexity of the data and related metadata. This means it is advisable to go beyond traditional forms of sharing analysis, which have focused on data availability only. Here we present a pilot study that aims to complement a survey on the availability of data related to peer-reviewed publications with an analysis of their findability, accessibility, useability and assessability (according to the """"intelligent data openness"""" scheme). Sharing rates in genomic anthropology (73.0%) were found to be higher than human genomics (32.4%), but lower than closely related research fields (from 96.8% to 79.2% for paleogenetics and evolutionary genetics, respectively). We discuss the privacy and methodological issues that could be linked to this finding. Comparisons of sharing rates across a wide range of disciplines has suggested that the idea of human genomics as a forerunner for the open data movement should be questioned. Finally, both in genomic anthropology and human genomics, findability and useability were found to be compliant with the expectations of an intelligent data openness, whereas only a minor part of studies met the need to make the data completely assessable.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 _not_qualitative/_video_data_,3 _not_human_observation_response_data",10.4436/jass.99016,"MICROARRAY EXPERIMENT MIAME;MINIMUM INFORMATION;WIDE ASSOCIATION;GENETIC RESEARCH;POPULATION;AVAILABILITY;RESOURCES;LESSONS;COMMON;Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Genome, Human;Genome;Genomics",,,"2 _not_qualitative/_video_data_,3 _not_human_observation_response_data",,Excluded,Excluded,1

Adoption of geographic information systems (GIS) as the primary production process for topographic maps, including digital database preparation (1975-2000) and product generation operations (2001-present), has led to faster and more standardized production in a semi-automated process. However, the topographic product has remained the same static graphic. A new form of topographic map as an interactive, linked knowledge base is now being created. The appearance of the Semantic Web and Linked Open Data allows the map to become an interactive knowledge base. In this current theory and implementation of topographic mapping, the map is a graphics-based interface to a triplestore knowledge base which includes a topographic feature ontology, semantics and relations, and instance data with geometry and topology available.

Many measures exist to summarize features of communities that support active living, but few are pan-Canadian and none use open data sources that can be widely shared. This study reports the development and validation of a novel set of indicators of active living environments using open data that can be linked to national health surveys and can be used by local, regional or national governments for public health surveillance.        Data and methods: A Geographic Information System (GIS) was used to calculate a variety of measures of the connectivity, density and proximity to destinations for 56,589 dissemination areas (DAs) across Canada (2016 data). Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to assess the association between each measure and the rates of walking to work and taking active transportation to work (a combination of walking, cycling and using public transportation) from census data. The active living environment measures selected for the final database were used to classify the DAs by the favourability of their active living environment into groups by k-medians clustering.        Results: All measures were correlated with walking-to-work and active-transportation-to-work rates at the DA level, whether they were derived using proprietary or open data sources. Coverage of open data was consistent across Canadian regions. Three measures were selected for the Canadian Active Living Environments (Can-ALE) dataset based on the correlation analysis, but also on the principles of suitability for a variety of community sizes and openly available data: (1) three-way intersection density of roads and footpaths derived from OpenStreetMap (OSM), (2) weighted dwelling density derived from Statistics Canada dwelling counts and (3) points of interest derived from OSM. A measure of access to public transportation was added for the subset of DAs in larger urban areas and was strongly related to active-transportation-to-work rates. Active-transportation-to-work rates were graded, in steps, by the five Can-ALE groups derived from the cluster analysis, although walking-to-work rates exceeded the national average only in the most favourable active living environments.        Interpretation: Open data may be used to derive measures that characterize the active living environments of Canadian communities.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health",10.25318/82-003-x201900500002-eng,PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY;NEIGHBORHOOD WALKABILITY;BUILT ENVIRONMENT;LAND-USE;QUALITY;WALKING;ASSOCIATIONS;ADULTS;TRAVEL;HELP,,,5_adresses_government_health,,Excluded,Excluded,1

To prevent and avoid crime is of great importance for urban authorities and citizens. Crime prediction using various urban sensing data provides a promising paradigm to cope with this challenging problem. However, previous studies on crime prediction mainly focus on coarse-grained prediction at the region level, which fail in fine-grained road-level crime inference due to data sparsity problems. This article proposes a road-level framework for fine-grained crime risk inference leveraging heterogeneous open data. We first extract a set of features from relevant external datasets and historical crime records, i.e., temporal, spatial, and recurrence crime features. We then establish a spatio-temporal crime pattern using spatio-temporal features, and further infer road-level crime risk incorporating with recurrence crime features. The framework not only considers a useful spatio-temporal pattern but also considers a unique crime near-repeat phenomenon, which helps address the data sparsity. We further present an application crime risk-aware route recommendation to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. This application cannot be solved well with coarse-grained (e.g., region-level) crime risk results since it is inconvenient for people to travel while avoiding large regions with potential crime risks. Experiments with the real-world datasets from New York City show that our framework accurately infers road-level crime risk and outperforms other baseline methods.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 _not_human_observation_response_data,4_not_prerequisites_barriers_facilitators_ | USER-NOTES: {""""Jürgen""""=>[""""statt \""""human subjects\"""" besser \""""human learning processes\""""?""""]}",10.1109/JSYST.2020.3023762,REGRESSION;Crime;Cereals,,,"3 _not_human_observation_response_data,4_not_prerequisites_barriers_facilitators_ |",,Excluded,Excluded,1

Such a framework should ensure that data collected during public health emergencies are accessible to the appropriate authorities and in a form that can help with timely decision-making during such public health crises. In this article, we highlight available open data policies across many countries, including in the Americas. Our analysis shows that there are currently no articulated policy guidelines for the collection and management of public health data across many countries, especially in Latin America. We propose that any national data governance strategy must address potential benefits, possible risks, examples of data that could be shared, and the attributes of such data.

Many approaches have been devised to tackle such difficulty. Although content-based approaches, which adopted resource-related data in comparing resources, played a major role in similarity measurement methodology, the lack of semantic insight on the data may leave these approaches imperfect. The purpose of this paper is to incorporate data semantics into the measuring process. Design/methodology/approach The emerged linked open data (LOD) provide a practical solution to tackle such difficulty. Common methodologies consuming LOD mainly focused on using link attributes that provide some sort of semantic relations between data. In this work, methods for measuring semantic distances between resources using information gathered from LOD were proposed. Such distances were then applied to music recommendation, focusing on the effect of various weight and level settings. Findings This work conducted experiments using the MusicBrainz dataset and evaluated the proposed schemes for the plausibility of LOD on music recommendation. The experimental result shows that the proposed methods electively improved classic approaches for both linked data semantic distance (LDSD) and PathSim methods by 47 and 9.7%, respectively. Originality/value The main contribution of this work is to develop novel schemes for incorporating knowledge from LOD.

The current work aims to question this assumption. Design/methodology/approach The current work critically reviews the quality of current evidence supporting organisational change management and considers the role of open science practices for the field. Findings First, evidence informing organisational change management is poor, heavily reliant upon unquestioned theoretical models and low-quality cross-sectional or case-study designs. Greater adoption of an evidence-based approach to practice could facilitate organisational change management, but only once a higher quality of evidence is available to inform more robust practical guidance. Second, open science practices look well placed to drive a higher quality of evidence suitable for informing future change management.

Far-reaching data provision inevitably needs the adoption of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) that offer data originators and depository custodians with a set of guidelines to safeguard a progressive data availability and reusability. Through a systematic literature review it is apparent that although FAIR data principles can play a key role in achieving sustainable agricultural operational and business performance, there are few published studies on how they have been adopted and used. The investigation examines: (1) how FAIR data assimilate with the sustainability framework; and (2) whether the use of FAIR data by the agriculture industry, has an impact on agricultural performance. The work identifies a social science research gap and suggests a method to guide agriculture practitioners in identifying the specific barriers in making their data FAIR.

We propose instead to interpret openness as a dynamic and highly situated mode of valuing the research process and its outputs, which encompasses economic as well as scientific, cultural, political, ethical, and social considerations. This interpretation creates a critical space for moving beyond the economic definitions of value embedded in the contemporary biosciences landscape and Open Science policies, and examining the diversity of interests and commitments that affect research practices in the life sciences. To illustrate these claims, we use three case studies that highlight the challenges surrounding decisions about how-and how best-to make things open. These cases, drawn from ethnographic engagement with Open Science debates and semistructured interviews carried out with UK-based biologists and bioinformaticians between 2013 and 2014, show how the enactment of openness reveals judgments about what constitutes a legitimate intellectual contribution, for whom, and with what implications.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using,3 _not_human_observation_response_data",10.1177/0162243916672071,OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE;GENETICS;COMMONS;FUTURE;MODELS;RISK,,,"1 not sharing/ not using,3 _not_human_observation_response_data",,Excluded,Excluded,1

There has been a rapid increase in uptake of participatory mapping, but the multidisciplinary nature of the field has resulted in a lack of consistency in the conducting and reporting of research, limiting further development. In this article, we argue that an open science approach is required to enable the field to advance, increasing transparency and replicability in how participatory mapping research is both conducted and reported. This argument is supported by the first large-scale systematic review of the field, which identifies specific areas within participatory mapping that would benefit from an open science approach. Four questions are used to explore the sample: (1) How are different participatory mapping methods being used and reported? (2) What information is given on the data collected through participatory mapping? (3) How are participant demographics being recorded? (4) Who is conducting the research, and where is it being published? From a total of 578 academic research articles, we analyzed a stratified sample of 117. The review reveals a significant lack of reporting on key details in the data collection process, restricting the transparency, replicability, and transferability of participatory mapping research and demonstrating the urgent need for an open science approach. Recommendations are then drawn from the results to guide the design of future participatory mapping research.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 _not_human_observation_response_data,4_not_prerequisites_barriers_facilitators_",10.1080/24694452.2022.2065964     EA APR 2022,GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION-SYSTEMS;DECISION-SUPPORT TOOL;GIS;PPGIS;REPRESENTATION;VALUES,,,"3 _not_human_observation_response_data,4_not_prerequisites_barriers_facilitators_",,Excluded,Excluded,1

Moreover, our graph-based algorithm fed with LOD-based features was able to overcome several baselines, as collaborative filtering and matrix factorization. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The cornerstone of our approach is the usage of Linked Open Data (LOD) for explanation aims. Indeed, the descriptive properties freely available in the LOD cloud (e.g., the author of a book or the director of a movie) can be used to build a graph that connects the recommendations the user received to the items she previously liked via the properties extracted from the LOD cloud. In a nutshell, our approach is based on the insight that properties describing the items the user previously liked as well as the suggestions she received can be effectively used to explain the recommendations.        Such a framework is both algorithm-independent and domain-independent, thus it can generate a natural language explanation for every kind of recommendation algorithm, and it can be used to explain a single recommendation (Top-1 scenario) as well as a group of recommendations (Top-N scenario). It is worth noting that the algorithm-independent characteristic does not mean that the framework is able to explain to the user how the recommendations have been generated and how the recommendation algorithm works. The framework explains to users why they might like the recommended items, independently from the recommendation algorithm that generated the recommendations.        In the experimental evaluation, we carried out a user study (N = 680) aiming to investigate the effectiveness of our framework in three different domains, as movies, books and music. Results showed that our technique leads to transparent explanations for all the domains, and such explanations resulted independent of the specific recommendation algorithm in most of the experimental settings. Moreover, we also showed the goodness of our strategy when an entire group of recommendations has to be explained.        As a case study, we integrated the framework in a real-world application, a conversational recommender system implemented as a Telegram Bot. The idea is to use the explanation for supporting both the training phase (when the user expresses her preferences) and the recommendation step (when the user receives the recommendations). Interesting outcomes emerge from these preliminary experiments. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Currently there is a multiplicity of open data policies at various levels of government, whereas very little systematic and structured research has been done on the issues that are covered by open data policies, their intent and actual impact. Furthermore, no suitable framework for comparing open data policies is available, as open data is a recent phenomenon and is thus in an early stage of development. In order to help bring about a better understanding of the common and differentiating elements in the policies and to identify the factors affecting the variation in policies, this paper develops a framework for comparing open data policies. The framework includes the factors of environment and context, policy content, performance indicators and public values. Using this framework, seven Dutch governmental policies at different government levels are compared. The comparison shows both similarities and differences among open data policies, providing opportunities to learn from each other's policies. The findings suggest that current policies are rather inward looking, open data policies can be improved by collaborating with other organizations, focusing on the impact of the policy, stimulating the use of open data and looking at the need to create a culture in which publicizing data is incorporated in daily working processes. The findings could contribute to the development of new open data policies and the improvement of existing open data policies.

Institutional repository (IR) technologies have transformed the traditional academic library practice, thus upsetting the work culture of librarians. Though studies there have been studies on the impact of IRs on academic librarians elsewhere in the world, none have been done on the Zimbabwean context. This study draws from a wider study which explored utilisation of institutional repositories in Zimbabwe's public universities. The study sought to answer the question: What is the role of the academic librarian in promoting the institutional repository? The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of technology (UTAUT) informed the study, while a mixed methods approach was employed using document analysis, questionnaires and interviews to collect data from librarians in eight public universities. Findings revealed that in some instances IR responsibilities were added to existing duties for incumbent staff while in others, staff were reassigned to IR roles resulting in diverse staff categories maintaining the IRs across the universities. Recommendations for effective and efficient management of the repositories by the universities are made. The study is relevant to other academic libraries in developing countries and Africa particularly countries whose economies are crumbling.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 _not_qualitative/_video_data_,4_not_prerequisites_barriers_facilitators_",10.1016/j.acalib.2019.05.005,TECHNOLOGY ACCEPTANCE MODEL;INSTITUTIONAL REPOSITORIES;OPEN ACCESS;SCHOLARLY COMMUNICATION;CHALLENGES;STRATEGIES;AFRICA,,,"2 _not_qualitative/_video_data_,4_not_prerequisites_barriers_facilitators_",,Excluded,Excluded,1

To capture both the systemic effects, local determinants, and individual-level risks and protective factors simultaneously, the prevention field has called for adoption of system science methods in general and agent-based models (ABMs) specifically. While these models can provide unique and timely insight into the potential of prevention strategies, an ABM's ability to do so depends strongly on its accuracy in capturing the phenomenon. Furthermore, for ABMs to be useful, they need to be accepted by and available to decision-makers and other stakeholders. These two attributes of accuracy and acceptability are key components of open science. To ensure the creation of high-fidelity models and reliability in their outcomes and consequent model-based decision-making, we present a set of recommendations for adopting and using this novel method.

The main contribution of this paper is the definition of a method to analyse open data portals and its application to a sample of municipalities of Spain, a country at the forefront of data re-utilization in Europe. Furthermore, the economic-financial information available in these portals is analysed, as it is essential to accountability, fight corruption and evaluate the financial sustainability and effectiveness of public service delivery. Results show that there is much room for improvement in this field. Only 40% of the cities analysed have an open data portal, and the average score of the sample analysed does not reach 50%. Most portals seem to work as mere data repositories, neglecting those aspects that promote data use by the non-expert public, accountability, citizen engagement and the quality of the data being disclosed (e.g., definition of the metadata used).

Current approaches to the problem in literature lack a comprehensive theoretical framework. Moreover, most of the evaluations concentrate on open data platforms, rather than on datasets. In this work, we address these two limitations and set up a framework of indicators to measure the quality of Open Government Data on a series of data quality dimensions at most granular level of measurement. We validated the evaluation framework by applying it to compare two cases of Italian OGD datasets: an internationally recognized good example of OGD, with centralized disclosure and extensive data quality controls, and samples of OGD from decentralized data disclosure (municipality level), with no possibility of extensive quality controls as in the former case, hence with supposed lower quality.        Starting from measurements based on the quality framework, we were able to verify the difference in quality: the measures showed a few common acquired good practices and weaknesses, and a set of discriminating factors that pertain to the type of datasets and the overall approach. On the basis of this evaluation, we also provided technical and policy guidelines to overcome the weaknesses observed in the decentralized release policy, addressing specific quality aspects.

Of the 62 articles that met our inclusion criteria, 41 had data available, and 37 had analysis scripts available. Both data and code for 36 of the articles were shared. We could run the scripts for 31 analyses, and we reproduced the main results for 21 articles. Although the percentage of articles for which both data and code were shared (36 out of 62, or 58%) and the percentage of articles for which main results could be computationally reproduced (21 out of 36, or 58%) were relatively high compared with the percentages found in other studies, there is clear room for improvement. We provide practical recommendations based on our observations and cite examples of good research practices in the studies whose main results we reproduced.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 _not_qualitative/_video_data_,4_not_prerequisites_barriers_facilitators_",10.1177/2515245920918872,REPLICATION;TRANSPARENCY;THREAT;Self Psychology,,,"2 _not_qualitative/_video_data_,4_not_prerequisites_barriers_facilitators_",,Excluded,Excluded,1

Policymakers have had to make decisions at speed in conditions of uncertainty, implementing policies that have had profound consequences for people's lives. Yet this process has sometimes been characterised by fragmentation, opacity and a disconnect between evidence and policy. In the United Kingdom, concerns about the secrecy that initially surrounded this process led to the creation of Independent SAGE, an unofficial group of scientists from different disciplines that came together to ask policy-relevant questions, review the evolving evidence, and make evidence-based recommendations. The group took a public health approach with a population perspective, worked in a holistic transdisciplinary way, and were committed to public engagement. In this paper, we review the lessons learned during its first year. These include the importance of learning from local expertise, the value of learning from other countries, the role of civil society as a critical friend to government, finding appropriate relationships between science and policy, and recognising the necessity of viewing issues through an equity lens.

The state of open science in psychophysiology is discussed from different perspectives, highlighting key challenges, potential benefits, and emerging solutions that are intended to facilitate open science practices. Three domains are emphasized: data sharing, preregistration, and multi-site studies. In the context of these broader domains, we present potential implementations of specific open science procedures such as data format harmonization, power analysis, data, presentation code and analysis pipeline sharing, suitable for psychophysiological research. Practical steps are discussed that may be taken to facilitate the adoption of open science practices in psychophysiology. These steps include (1) promoting broad and accessible training in the skills needed to implement open science practices, such as collaborative research and computational reproducibility initiatives, (2) establishing mechanisms that provide practical assistance in sharing of processing pipelines, presentation code, and data in an efficient way, and (3) improving the incentive structure for open science approaches.

However, these programs often fall short of including learners as agents in the entire process, and thus contrast with the growing open science movement within scientific communities. Notably, study ideation and peer review, which are central to the making of science, are typically reserved for professional scientists. This study describes the implementation of an open science curriculum that engages high school students in a full cycle of scientific inquiry. We explored the focus and quality of students' study designs and peer reviews, and their perceptions of open science based on their participation in the program. Specifically, we implemented a human brain and behavior citizen science unit in 6 classrooms across 3 high schools. After learning about open science and citizen science, students (N = 104) participated in scientist-initiated research studies, and then collaboratively proposed their own studies to investigate personally interesting questions about human behavior and the brain. Students then peer reviewed proposals of students from other schools. Based on a qualitative and quantitative analysis of students' artifacts created in-unit and on a pre and posttest, we describe their interests, abilities, and self-reported experiences with study design and peer review. Our findings suggest that participation in open science in a human brain and behavior research context can engage students with critical aspects of experiment design, as well as with issues that are unique to human subjects research, such as research ethics. Meanwhile, the quality of students' study designs and reviews changed in notable, but mixed, ways: While students improved in justifying the importance of research studies, they did not improve in their abilities to align methods to their research questions. In terms of peer review, students generally reported that their peers' feedback was helpful, but our analysis showed that student reviewers struggled to articulate concrete recommendations for improvement. In light of these findings, we discuss the need for curricula that support the development of research and review abilities by building on students' interests, while also guiding students in transferring these abilities across a range of research foci.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 _not_qualitative/_video_data_,3 _not_human_observation_response_data",10.1007/s11251-023-09633-9     EA JUL 2023,CITIZEN-SCIENCE;FEEDBACK PERCEPTIONS;KNOWLEDGE;PSYCHOLOGY;VARIABLES;IMPACT;PARTICIPATION;ANONYMITY;TEACHERS;INQUIRY;Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Brain,,,"2 _not_qualitative/_video_data_,3 _not_human_observation_response_data",,Excluded,Excluded,1

The methodology follows a systematic search for the relevant resources, their classification and identification of six open data benchmarks to be further analyzed, the identification of their key components through decomposition, their description, and identifying the similarities and differences. Three major groups of indices and four periods that characterize the efforts to benchmark and measure the development of open data are identified, where the first measure the openness of the selected categories of data, the second focuses on different aspects of the open data ecosystem, using a large number of variables, and the third is a combination of both approaches. Recommendations as well as trends that can form the benchmarking frameworks in the future are also discussed. The findings are of a high importance for individual countries, which allow for correct and accurate interpretation of the results changes in the scope of a given index or rank, i.e., whether the difference in results is the result of national efforts or the subject of changes in the specific index, as well as how to combine and interpret the results of a number of indices for correct decision-making and for the definition of the future actions where the results vary significantly.

Online movements including #MeToo and #WhyIDidntReport emerged to shed light on gender-based violence. These movements generate large quantities of data with little consistency and oversight across research groups, disciplines, and review boards on data ethics. With the recent push in social science to publish data to open science databases, the concerns of feminist psychologists and ethical concerns of social media research with survivors have become more salient. In this article, we describe and address these ethical issues by reviewing existing social media sexual assault disclosure research and make concrete recommendations for authors seeking to use social media data. We also seek to address these ethical concerns by noting the work of some feminist researchers, but also by pushing researchers to do more for survivors through a survivor-informed approach to this research in an open science context. We propose four survivor-informed recommendations for research with this vulnerable population: (a) get input from survivors, (b) update ethics review boards, (c) maximize benefits to participants, and (d) utilize study-appropriate datasets with informed consent.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 _not_human_observation_response_data,4_not_prerequisites_barriers_facilitators_",10.1177/03616843211039175     EA SEP 2021,SEXUAL VIOLENCE;VICTIMIZATION;NOTOKAY;IMPACT;ME;Disclosure;Self Disclosure;Survivors,,,"3 _not_human_observation_response_data,4_not_prerequisites_barriers_facilitators_",,Excluded,Excluded,1

Here, TOD attributes are measurable or perceivable attributes that TOD proponents cherish, and TOD outcomes are the targeted outcomes, such as increased ridership, associated at least partially with TOD attributes. Based on BOD from Shenzhen (China), we create indicators to measure both TOD attributes and outcomes. We explore the associations of TOD attributes, including centrality of a TOD site, travel time to the central business district, density, destination, diversity, and design, with TOD outcomes. We identify the TOD attribute that best predicts TOD outcomes such as metro ridership, frequent riders, people co-located in a station area, and ratios derived from these outcomes. We find that special neighborhoods, specific metro lines, and age of the district significantly influence TOD outcomes. Our study has a few limitations: a) the BOD we use do not directly measure TOD attributes, so proxies must be used; and b) the BOD we use contain little information about """"why,"""" """"who,"""" and """"how,"""" such as why people rode transit, who they were, and how they perceived/appreciated various TOD attributes. Takeway for practice: BOD-derived variables allow planners to revalidate existing planning guidelines and principles concerning TOD and adapt them to local contexts. BOD can also be used to formulate new metrics to evaluate different TOD plans or projects in ways not achievable with traditional data alone. In short, BOD can and should be used to refine TOD analytics and design and to implement corresponding theories in pursuit of TOD.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 _not_human_observation_response_data",10.1080/01944363.2020.1737182     EA APR 2020,ACCESSIBILITY;TRAVEL;TOD;RIDERSHIP;TYPOLOGY;DENSITY;CITIES;AREAS,,,3 _not_human_observation_response_data,,Excluded,Excluded,1

Many governments have created and published a huge amount of open data; however, people have a hard time using open data because of data quality issues. The UK, the USA and Korea have created and published open data; however, the rate of open data implementation and level of open data impact is very low because of data quality issues like incompatible data formats and incomplete data. This study aims to compare the statuses of data quality from open government sites in the UK, the USA and Korea and also present guidelines for publishing data format and enhancing data completeness.        Design/methodology/approach This study uses statistical analysis of different data formats and examination of data completeness to explore key issues of data quality in open government data.        Findings Findings show that the USA and the UK have published more than 50 per cent of open data in level one. Korea has published 52.8 per cent of data in level three. Level one data are not machine-readable; therefore, users have a hard time using them. The level one data are found in portable document format and hyper text markup language (HTML) and are locked up in documents; therefore, machines cannot extract out the data. Findings show that incomplete data are existing in all three governments' open data.        Originality/value Governments should investigate data incompleteness of all open data and correct incomplete data of the most used data.

In this sense, we consider the current discussion as a chance to enhance the trustworthiness of our findings and to ultimately create justified confidence.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 _not_qualitative/_video_data_,4_not_prerequisites_barriers_facilitators_",10.1026/1612-5010/a000167,PSYCHOLOGICAL-RESEARCH;REGISTERED-REPORTS;SPECIAL SECTION;REPLICABILITY;INCENTIVES;EXERCISE;SPORT;RECOMMENDATIONS;REPLICATION;TRUTH,,,"2 _not_qualitative/_video_data_,4_not_prerequisites_barriers_facilitators_",,Excluded,Excluded,1

Today, this nation is also emerging as a global leader in advancing open data phenomena, launching an extremely wide range of public platforms in the sphere. In this respect, this article is mostly presented as a policy review of the open data movement in this Nordic state through the prism of its traditional inclination toward philosophy of open government, open economy, open source software, open science, and even pirate politics. In an attempt to understand a highly context dependable and truly multidimensional nature of the phenomena, the research analyzes various political and socioeconomic backgrounds of the open data movement, tracing interesting patterns and promising networking trends that could be observed today in the communication between its key stakeholders and demonstrating in an intrinsically empirical and illustrative manner how its fundamental pillars such as civic engagement, direct participation and public-private partnerships are exactly promoted within one given society.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health",10.1080/1097198X.2017.1388696,WELFARE-STATE;INFORMATION;INNOVATION;KNOWLEDGE;IMPLEMENTATION;VOLUNTARY;WIKILEAKS;BENEFITS;ADOPTION;FREEDOM;Sweden,,,5_adresses_government_health,,Excluded,Excluded,1

However, various intertwining barriers hinder the adoption of open data. They are stemming from legislation and licensing, technology and operation, use level, institution and governance, as well as economic considerations. Through the use of social network analysis (SNA), this study identified 43 barriers faced by stakeholders in an open data project in Hong Kong and investigated their interdependencies. Hong Kong was selected as a representative case due to its relatively low ranking in the Global Open Data Index (24th) and poor data quality. It was found that the lack of an open data policy should be tackled as a matter of priority to provide technical guidance for the public sector, ensure data quality and achieve expected outcomes. It is also necessary to improve the IT literacy/mindset of the public sector, refine the governance structure relating to the delivery of open data initiatives, encourage engagement from private entities and provide a feedback loop for users. This study explored the interrelationships between various barriers to open data adoption and proposes practical recommendations to enhance open data development in the context of emerging """"smart cities"""".","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health",10.1016/j.cities.2019.03.009,SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS;OPEN GOVERNMENT DATA;INFORMATION;PROJECTS;ACCESS;RISKS;Hong Kong,,,5_adresses_government_health,,Excluded,Excluded,1

To quantify the relative advantage of one mode over the other, we introduce the notion of travel gradient, which is travel cost difference divided by travel time difference. Based on the signs of travel cost and time differences, we classify all trips into four quadrants. Quadrant II trips are selected for further analysis because rail transit is identified to be competitive with taxi for such trips. We also explore the relation between various trip characteristics and travel gradient with and without considering the spatial variation of such a relation. Main research findings include: (1) around 70% of the taxi trips in the considered datasets can be substituted with rail transit trips if the maximum walking distance is 0.5 miles at each trip end; (2) for around 10% of taxi trips with both modes being viable, rail transit dominates taxi in both travel cost and time; for the rest, rail transit is competitive with taxi; (3) the marginal travel cost saving due to mode switching from taxi to rail transit is about $70; and (4) there exist clearly spatial variations of the relation between trip characteristics and travel gradient. The main policy recommendation from this study is that rail transit can be better marketed by highlighting its relative advantage over taxi in travel time and cost, especially for travels in certain directions and time periods.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 not sharing/ not using,3 _not_human_observation_response_data",10.1016/j.tranpol.2021.11.003     EA NOV 2021,GEOGRAPHICALLY WEIGHTED REGRESSION;PUBLIC-TRANSIT;PROPERTY-VALUES;MODE CHOICE;RIDERSHIP;PATTERNS;WASHINGTON;SUBWAY;IMPACT;USAGE;Travel,,,"1 not sharing/ not using,3 _not_human_observation_response_data",,Excluded,Excluded,1

We investigated whether open data policies influence participants' rate of consent by randomly assigning participants to view consent forms with and without discussion of open data policies. No participants declined to participate, regardless of condition, nor did rates of drop-out vs. completion vary between conditions. Furthermore, no significant change in potential consent rates was reported when participants were openly asked about the influence of open data policies on their likelihood of consent. However, follow-up analyses indicated possible poor attention to consent forms, consistent with previous research. Moreover, thematic analysis of participants' considerations of open data policy indicated multiple considerations such as concerns regarding confidentiality, anonymity, data security, and study sensitivity. The impact of open data policies on participation raises complex issues at the intersection of ethics and scientific innovation. We conclude by encouraging researchers to consider participants as stakeholders in open data policy and by providing recommendations for open data policies in human subjects research.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 _not_qualitative/_video_data_,4_not_prerequisites_barriers_facilitators_",10.1371/journal.pone.0125208,INFORMED-CONSENT;PSYCHOLOGICAL-RESEARCH;PRIVACY;ETHICS;SCIENCE;Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Research Subjects,,,"2 _not_qualitative/_video_data_,4_not_prerequisites_barriers_facilitators_",,Excluded,Excluded,1

Thus, through this research, we aim to address the level of data quality by introducing a new framework that constantly monitors and evaluates the OGD quality of Western Balkan (WB) National Open Data Portals. The advantage of the proposed framework is the integration on the portal level enabling information exposure about the quality dimension at any time. An additional value of the framework is the ability to provide recommendations with the intention of improving quality issues. The applicability and findings of the proposed framework are not limited to the WB and once contextualized that could be applied to other countries in the Eastern European that face similar data quality challenges.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5_adresses_government_health",10.1177/21582440221104813,Research Design,,,5_adresses_government_health,,Excluded,Excluded,1

Law enforcement and the judiciary are increasingly making data available, to increase trust and confidence in the criminal justice system. Due to privacy legislation, judicial open data - like court judgements - in Europe is usually anonymized. And even if the court judgement has been made public, the rest of the case file is usually not published. Therefore, the question arises to what extent criminological research into sentencing can make use of anonymized open data. We answer this question based on a case study in which we use the open data of the Dutch criminal justice system that is available on . Over the period 2015-2020, we analysed sentencing in 25,366 court judgements and investigated the relationship between sentence severity and the offender's use of advanced Information and Communication Technology (ICT). The most important results are, firstly, that offenders who use advanced ICT are sentenced to longer custodial sentences compared to other offenders. Secondly, sentencing research with open data is found to be feasible.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""""Jürgen""""=>""""Excluded"""", """"Rümeysa""""=>""""Excluded""""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 _not_qualitative/_video_data_,3 _not_human_observation_response_data",10.1007/s10610-021-09503-5     EA FEB 2022,PUNISHMENT;GUIDELINES;DECISIONS;POLITICS;MODEL;Crime,,,"2 _not_qualitative/_video_data_,3 _not_human_observation_response_data",,Excluded,Excluded,1
