Video research data are highly valuable for educational research due to their unique potential for detailed analysis and reconstruction of classroom interactions, including facial expressions, gestures, and posture. The versatility of video data, such as its repeatability and manipulability (e.g., speed, zoom), allows for nuanced assessment of complex teaching events. Moreover, video data can be utilized for both quantitative and qualitative research, enabling multiple research questions to be addressed using the same video resource. Notably, examples like the TALIS video study and the MET study demonstrate how video data have contributed to measuring teaching quality, investigating predictors for teaching quality in international comparisons, and exploring teachers' practices for cognitive activation through tasks and interactions with students.

Given these advantages, the sharing and reusing of video research data in education would be immensely valuable. However, the current practices of sharing and reusing video data are often underutilized, hindering their potential for research in education.

Despite the importance of this issue, there is limited understanding of the reasons behind the underdevelopment of sharing and reusing video research data in education. Existing investigations primarily focus on research data as a whole and only partially address the specific challenges related to video data. Additionally, the literature on video research data is scattered across various publication outlets, lacking a comprehensive and systematic examination of the barriers and facilitators of sharing and reusing video research data in education.

To address this gap, we conduct a systematic review to identify and categorize the factors that contribute to the sharing or reusing of video research data in education. We will situate these factors within a "research ecosystem" framework (European Commission, 2018, p. 10), which encompasses the scientific community's context (e.g. incentives, norms, policies of scientific societies), available infrastructure (e.g. discipline specific data centers), the researchers themselves (e.g. awareness, skills), and their research project (e.g. study design, vulnerable sample; see Fig. 1). By undertaking this review, we aim to enhance awareness and understanding of these factors, ultimately reducing barriers and expanding facilitators for sharing and reusing video research data in education.

  - publication year
  - type of data addressed (video, interview, qualitative in general, ...)
  - discipline
  - type of document (survey, guideline, study, commentary, ...)
* barriers and facilitators
  - Descriptions of the barriers and facilitators to sharing and reusing video research data

As we collect and systematize different factors that influence sharing and reusing research data (and not get an estimate of effect size), bias is not as relevant in our case.

So far we do not plan to describe subgroups. If we conclude that it might become relevant while reading through the documents we will define subgroups bottom-up from the material.

We estimate the generalizability to video data by gauging the applicability of the barriers and facilitators to video data (if the document does not address video data).
